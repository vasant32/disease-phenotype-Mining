<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was done to identify gene to gene interactions which could be associated with the risk of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We genotyped 23 different loci in the 15 candidate genes of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in 504 unrelated Type 2 diabetic patients and 133 non-diabetic control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We analysed gene to gene interactions among 23 polymorphic loci using the multifactor-dimensionality reduction (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDR</z:chebi>) method, which has been shown to be effective for detecting and characterising gene to gene interactions in case-control studies with relatively small samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The <z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDR</z:chebi> analysis showed a significant gene to gene interaction between the Ala55Val polymorphism in the uncoupling protein 2 gene ( UCP2) and the 161C&gt;T polymorphism in the exon 6 of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma ( PPARgamma) gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This interaction showed the maximum consistency and minimum prediction error among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> gene to gene interaction models evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the combination of the UCP2 55 Ala/Val heterozygote and the PPARgamma 161 C/C homozygote was associated with a reduced risk of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (odds ratio: 0.51, 95% CI: 0.34 to 0.77, p=0.0016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Using the <z:chebi fb="14" ids="53218">MDR</z:chebi> method, we showed a two-locus interaction between the UCP2 and PPARgamma genes among 23 loci in the candidate genes of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The determination of such genotype combinations contributing to Type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> could provide a new tool for identifying high-risk individuals </plain></SENT>
