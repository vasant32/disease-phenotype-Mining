<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of taspoglutide (R1583/BIM51077), a human once-weekly glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 analog, in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> inadequately controlled with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Type 2 diabetic (n = 306) patients who failed to obtain glycemic control (A1C 7-9.5%) despite 1,500 mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> daily were randomly assigned to 8 weeks of double-blind subcutaneous treatment with placebo or taspoglutide, either 5, 10, or 20 mg once weekly or 10 or 20 mg once every 2 weeks, and followed for 4 additional weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received their previously established dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> throughout the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Glycemic control was assessed by change in A1C (percent) from baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Significantly greater (P &lt; 0.0001) reductions in A1C from a mean +/- SD baseline of 7.9 +/- 0.7% were observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> taspoglutide groups compared with placebo after 8 weeks of treatment: -1.0 +/- 0.1% (5 mg once weekly), -1.2 +/- 0.1% (10 mg once weekly), -1.2 +/- 0.1% (20 mg once weekly), -0.9 +/- 0.1% (10 mg Q2W), and -1.0 +/- 0.1% (20 mg Q2W) vs. -0.2 +/- 0.1% with placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After 8 weeks, body <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> was significantly greater in the 10 mg (-2.1 +/- 0.3 kg, P = 0.0035 vs. placebo) and 20 mg (-2.8 +/- 0.3 kg, P &lt; 0.0001) once-weekly groups and the 20 mg once every 2 weeks (-1.9 +/- 0.3 kg, P = 0.0083) group than with placebo (-0.8 +/- 0.3 kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most common adverse event was dose-dependent, transient, mild-to-moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo>; the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> was very low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Taspoglutide used in combination with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> significantly improves fasting and postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control and induces <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo>, with a favorable tolerability profile </plain></SENT>
