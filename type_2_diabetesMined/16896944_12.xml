<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using transcriptomics and proteomics, we investigated how insulin affects the transcription and protein secretion profile of mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found that insulin has a significant impact on protein secretion of 3T3-L1 adipocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, transcription is not the major regulation point for these secreted proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For extracellular matrix components, our data suggest that the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level of processing enzymes, but not of target proteins, is the regulating point at which insulin stimulates secretion and function of the relevant proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among these enzymes, we report a novel finding, namely that sulfatase 2 gene is regulated by insulin, which may induce a functional change in cultured adipocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: We propose that enhancement of protein processing and secretion rather than transcription of the secreted protein genes is part of the strategic role of insulin in the induction of cellular responses </plain></SENT>
