<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The discrepancy of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> incidence and care between socioeconomic statuses has seldom been studied concurrently in nations with universal health coverage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to delineate whether income disparity is associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> incidence and inequality of care under a national health insurance (NHI) program in Asia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: From the Taiwan NHI database in 2000, a representative cohort aged â‰¥20 years and free of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (n = 600,662) were followed up until 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We regarded individuals exempt from paying the NHI premium as being poor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) were used to discover any excess risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the poor population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The indicators used to evaluate quality of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care included the proportion of diabetic patients identified through hospitalization, visits to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> clinics, and completion of recommended <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the poor population was 20.4 per 1,000 person-years (HR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.3-1.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with their middle-income counterparts, the adjusted odds ratio (OR) for the poor population incidentally identified as having <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> through hospitalization was 2.2 (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Poor persons with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were less likely to visit any <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> clinic (OR, 0.4; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The ORs for the poor population with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> to receive tests for glycated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">low-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> were 0.6 (0.4-0.9), 0.4 (0.2-0.7), 0.5 (0.4-0.8), and 0.4 (0.2-0.9), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Poverty is associated not only with higher <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> incidence but also with inequality of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care in a northeast Asian population, despite universal health coverage </plain></SENT>
