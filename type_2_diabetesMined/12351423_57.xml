<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As <z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase (AMPK) plays an important role in muscle metabolism during exercise, we investigated the effects of the AMPK activator 5-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="22512">aminoimidazole</z:chebi>-4-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="23004,37622">carboxamide</z:chebi>-1-beta-D-ribofuranoside (AICAR) on insulin action in insulin-resistant high-fat-fed (HF) rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rats received a subcutaneous injection of 250 mg/kg AICAR (HF-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIC</z:e>) or saline (HF-Con) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The next day, euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp studies were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> infusion rate during the clamp was enhanced (50%) in HF-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIC</z:e> compared with HF-Con rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Insulin-stimulated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake was improved in white but not in red quadriceps, whereas <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthesis was improved in both red and white quadriceps of HF-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIC</z:e> rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>HF-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIC</z:e> rats also showed increased insulin suppressibility of hepatic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> output (HGO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>AICAR-induced responses in both liver and muscle were accompanied by reduced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15531">malonyl-CoA</z:chebi> content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Clamp HGO correlated closely with hepatic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> content (r = 0.67, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, a single dose of AICAR leads to an apparent enhancement in whole-body, muscle, and liver insulin action in HF rats that extends beyond the expected time of AMPK activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Whether altered tissue <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> metabolism mediates AICAR effects on insulin action remains to be determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Follow-up studies suggest that at least some of the post-AICAR insulin-enhancing effects also occur in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Independent of this, the results suggest that pharmacological activation of AMPK may have potential in treating insulin-resistant states and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
