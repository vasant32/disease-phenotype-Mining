<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Serum 1,5-anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG) drops as serum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> rises above the renal threshold for <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and has been proposed as a marker for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011998'>postprandial hyperglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study is to demonstrate the relationship between 1,5-AG and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011998'>postprandial hyperglycemia</z:hpo>, as assessed by the continuous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> monitoring system (CGMS) in suboptimally controlled patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Patients with type 1 or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and an HbA(1c) (A1C) between 6.5 and 8% with stable glycemic control were recruited from two sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A CGMS monitor was worn for two consecutive 72-h periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, mean postmeal maximum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (MPMG), and area under the curve for <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> above 180 mg/dl (AUC-180), were compared with 1,5-AG, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24103">fructosamine</z:chebi> (FA), and A1C at baseline, day 4, and day 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 1,5-AG varied considerably between patients (6.5 +/- 3.2 mug/ml [means +/- SD]) despite similar A1C (7.3 +/- 0.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean 1,5-AG (r = -0.45, P = 0.006) correlated with AUC-180 more robustly than A1C (r = 0.33, P = 0.057) or FA (r = 0.38, P = 0.88) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MPMG correlated more strongly with 1,5-AG (r = -0.54, P = 0.004) than with A1C (r = 0.40, P = 0.03) or FA (r = 0.32, P = 0.07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: 1,5-AG reflects glycemic excursions, often in the postprandial state, more robustly than A1C or FA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>1,5-AG may be useful as a complementary marker to A1C to assess glycemic control in moderately controlled patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
