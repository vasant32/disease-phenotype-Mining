<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Pancreatic beta cells are specialised <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> cells that continuously sense the levels of blood sugar and other fuels and, in response, secrete insulin to maintain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> fuel homeostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During postprandial periods an elevated level of plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> rapidly stimulates insulin secretion to decrease hepatic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> output and promote <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake into other tissues, principally muscle and adipose tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Beta cell mitochondria play a key role in this process, not only by providing energy in the form of ATP to support insulin secretion, but also by synthesising metabolites (anaplerosis) that can act, both intra- and extramitochondrially, as factors that couple <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> sensing to insulin granule exocytosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ATP on its own, and possibly modulated by these coupling factors, triggers closure of the ATP-sensitive <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> channel, resulting in membrane depolarisation that increases intracellular calcium to cause insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The metabolic imbalance caused by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020473" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperlipidaemia</z:e> severely affects <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> metabolism, leading to the development of impaired <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-induced insulin secretion in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It appears that the anaplerotic enzyme <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> carboxylase participates directly or indirectly in several metabolic pathways which are important for <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-induced insulin secretion, including: the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi>/malate cycle, the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="2" ids="50744">citrate</z:chebi> cycle, the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi>/isocitrate cycle and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>-dehydrogenase-catalysed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16810">alpha-ketoglutarate</z:chebi> production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These four pathways enable 'shuttling' or 'recycling' of these intermediate(s) into and out of mitochondrion, allowing continuous production of intracellular messenger(s) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this review is to present an account of recent progress in this area of central importance in the realm of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> research </plain></SENT>
