<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A cross-sectional study of men and women aged 50-79 years were invited to attend a standardized interview and physical examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>Diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> was defined as a fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (concentration of greater than or = 126) or a previous diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Demographic, socioeconomic, and risk factor data were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 1293 persons (468 Hakaas, 440 Fukienese, and 385 aborigines) completed the examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hakaas had the highest age-adjusted prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, 17.9% in men and 15.5% in women, followed by Fukienese, 14.5% in men and 12.8% in women </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> prevalence was positively associated with family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002155'>hypertriglyceridemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The ethnic variation in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prevalence was reduced after adjustment for age, sex and significant factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The multivariate-adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence interval) were 1.27 (0.76-2.12) for Fukienese and 1.44 (0.89-2.33) for Hakaas compared with aborigines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>Diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> is a major public health problem in Taiwan and warrants prevention efforts tailored to the country's different ethnic groups </plain></SENT>
