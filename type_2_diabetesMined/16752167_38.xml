<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used the Health Utilities Index-III, an instrument that measures health-related quality of life based on community preferences in units of health utility (scaled from 0=<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> to 1.0=perfect health), in 909 primary care patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Demographic and clinical correlates of health-related quality of life were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median health utility score for this population was 0.70 (interquartile range 0.39-0.88) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In univariate analyses, older age, female sex, low socioeconomic status, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>, microvascular complications, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>peripheral vascular disease</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0006528'>chronic lung disease</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, insulin use and number of medications correlated with decreased quality of life, while <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020443" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypercholesterolaemia</z:e> did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In multiple regression analyses, microvascular complications, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> were most strongly related to decreased health-related quality of life, independently of duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>; in these models, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> had a utility of 0.59, while patients without symptomatic comorbidities did not have a significantly reduced quality of life </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The data suggest that treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> and prevention of complications have the greatest potential to improve health-related quality of life in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
