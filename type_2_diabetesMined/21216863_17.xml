<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine trends in the prevalence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and related conditions in Asian Americans compared with non-Hispanic whites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We analyzed data from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) from 1997 to 2008 to construct a nationally representative sample of 230,503 U.S. adults aged â‰¥ 18 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of these adults, 11,056 identified themselves as Asian Americans and 219,447 as non-Hispanic whites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The age- and sex-adjusted prevalence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was higher in Asian Americans than in whites throughout the study period (4.3-8.2% vs. 3.8-6.0%), and there was a significant upward trend in both ethnic groups (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BMI also was increased in both groups, but age- and sex-adjusted BMI was consistently lower in Asian Americans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In fully adjusted logistic regression models, Asian Americans remained 30-50% more likely to have <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> than their white counterparts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, Asian Indians had the highest odds of prevalent type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, followed by Filipinos, other Asians, and Chinese </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Compared with their white counterparts, Asian Americans have a significantly higher risk for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, despite having substantially lower BMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Additional investigation of this disparity is warranted, with the aim of tailoring optimal <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prevention strategies to Asian Americans </plain></SENT>
