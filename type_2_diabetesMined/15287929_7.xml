<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness of once-daily combined <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> and TZD therapy compared with other therapeutic regimens typically utilized at later stages of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Methods: A random chart review of 300 type 2 diabetic patients and extraction of data for body mass index (BMI), duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> and A1c was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the 210 type 2 diabetic subjects in whom this information was currently available, the data were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eighty-six patients on once-daily <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> had an average A1c of 6.2% (group A), and 58 subjects on triple therapy (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi>) (group B) had an average <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c (HbA1c) of 6.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 22 subjects on one injection of insulin per day in addition to triple therapy (group C) had an average HbA1c of 7.6%, and the 44 subjects on more than one insulin injection per day plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> and/or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> (group D) had an average HbA1c of 8.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>HbA1cs below 7.0% were found in 91.9% of group A, 21.7% of group B, 36.4% of group C and 56.8% of group D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>HbA1cs below 6.5% were found in 78.2% in group A, 15.5% in group B, 22.7% in group C and 31.8% in group D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>HbA1cs below 6.0% were found in 41.9% in group A, 6.9% in group B, 9.1% in group C and 13.6% in group D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On univariate analyses, the HbA1c was positively associated with the duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and the BMI and negatively associated with random C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, on multiple regression analysis, there was no statistical correlation between the duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or BMI with the HbA1c </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, there was a strong statistical correlation between the random C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> level and the HbA1c (p = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Early initiation of therapy for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with a once-daily combination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> provides the greatest opportunity to achieve A1cs within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The level of achieved glycaemic control is not dependent on the number or potency of the therapies utilized but is dependent on the level of endogenous insulin production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The use of a TZD as part of initial therapy of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with its documented ability to preserve or improve beta-cell function has the potential to achieve prolonged normoglycaemia in the type 2 diabetic patient </plain></SENT>
