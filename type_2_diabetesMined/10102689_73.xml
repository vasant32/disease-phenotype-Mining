<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The disease is characterized by initial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo>, progressing to <z:mp ids='MP_0002727'>hypoinsulinemia</z:mp> associated with depleted pancreatic insulin stores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The contribution of changes in beta-cell turnover to insulin deficiency was investigated in vivo during transition to overt <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Normo glycemic <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-prone P. obesus animals who were given a high-calorie diet developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> within 4 days, which was found to be associated with a progressive decline in pancreatic insulin content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This was accompanied by a transient increase in beta-cell proliferative activity and by a prolonged increase in the rate of beta-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, culminating in disruption of islet architecture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The hypothesis that "glucotoxicity" was responsible for these in vivo changes was investigated in vitro in primary islet cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Exposure of islets from <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-prone P. obesus to high <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels resulted in a dose-dependent increase in beta-cell DNA fragmentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, high <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels did not induce DNA fragmentation in rat islets, whereas islets from a <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-resistant P. obesus line exhibited a reduced and delayed response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="40618">Aminoguanidine</z:chebi> did not prevent <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-induced beta-cell DNA fragmentation in vitro, suggesting that formation of nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> and/or advanced glycation end products plays no major role </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Elevated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations stimulated beta-cell proliferation in both rat and P. obesus islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, unlike the marked long-lasting effect in rat islets, only a transient and reduced proliferative response was observed in P. obesus islets; furthermore, beta-cell proliferation was inhibited after prolonged exposure to elevated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>-induced beta-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> coupled with reduced proliferative capacity may contribute to the insulin deficiency and deterioration of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis in P. obesus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Similar adverse effects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> could play a role in the evolution of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in genetically susceptible individuals </plain></SENT>
