<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is a polygenic disease characterized by defects in both insulin secretion and insulin action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have previously reported that isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in muscle by a tissue-specific insulin receptor knockout (MIRKO mouse) is not sufficient to alter <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis, whereas beta-cell-specific insulin receptor knockout (betaIRKO) mice manifest severe progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> due to loss of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>-phase insulin release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To explore the interaction between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in muscle and altered insulin secretion, we created a double tissue-specific insulin receptor knockout in these tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, betaIRKO-MIRKO mice show an improvement rather than a deterioration of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance when compared to betaIRKO mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This is due to improved <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> insulin release and redistribution of substrates with increased <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake in adipose tissue and liver in vivo, without a significant decrease in muscle <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in muscle leads to improved <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated first-phase insulin secretion from beta-cells and shunting of substrates to nonmuscle tissues, collectively leading to <z:mp ids='MP_0005292'>improved glucose tolerance</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that muscle, either via changes in substrate availability or by acting as an <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> tissue, communicates with and regulates insulin sensitivity in other tissues </plain></SENT>
