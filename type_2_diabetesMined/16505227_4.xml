<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Genetic variation in PTPN1, a <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> susceptibility gene, was investigated for a role in diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The PTPN1 gene encodes protein tyrosine phosphatase-1B, which is ubiquitously expressed and plays a role in the regulation of several signaling pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subclinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> was assessed in 590 Caucasian participants with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Heart Study using B-mode ultrasound measurement of carotid intima-media thickness (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>) and computed tomography measurement of carotid calcified plaque (CarCP) and coronary calcified plaque (CorCP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in PTPN1 were genotyped and assessed for association with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>, CarCP, and CorCP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 12 SNPs within a block of linkage disequilibrium encompassing the coding sequence of PTPN1 were significantly associated with CorCP (P values from &lt;0.0001 to 0.043) and 3 SNPs also within the block approached significance (P values from 0.058 to 0.066) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, a nine-SNP haplotype (GACTTCAGO) was also associated with increased CorCP under a dominant model (P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No association was detected with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> or CarCP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The associated SNPs and haplotype are the same as those observed to be associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, and fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> in previous studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>With the inclusion of the most likely haplo-genotype for each individual, the heritability estimate of CorCP increased from 0.53 +/- 0.1 to 0.57 +/- 0.1 (P = 8.1 x 10(-10)), suggesting a modest but detectable effect of this gene on the phenotype of CorCP in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
