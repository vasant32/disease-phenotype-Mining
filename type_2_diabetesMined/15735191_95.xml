<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>gestational diabetes</z:hpo> mellitus (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e>) varies in direct proportion with the prevalence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in a given population or ethnic group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Given that the number of people with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> worldwide is expected to increase at record levels through 2030, we examined temporal trends in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> among diverse ethnic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Kaiser Permanente of Colorado (KPCO) has used a standard protocol to universally screen for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> since 1994 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This report is based on 36,403 KPCO singleton pregnancies occurring between 1994 and 2002 and examines trends in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> prevalence among women with diverse ethnic backgrounds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> among KPCO members doubled from 1994 to 2002 (2.1-4.1%, P &lt; 0.001), with significant increases in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> racial/ethnic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In logistic regression, year of diagnosis (odds ratio [OR] and 95% CI per 1 year = 1.12 [1.09-1.14]), mother's age (OR per 5 years = 1.7 [1.6-1.8]) and ethnicity other than non-Hispanic white (OR = 2.1 [1.9-2.4]) were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> significantly associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Birth year remained significant (OR = 1.06, P = 0.006), even after adjusting for prior <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that the prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> is increasing in a universally screened multiethnic population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The increasing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> prevalence suggests that the vicious cycle of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in pregnancy initially described among Pima Indians may also be occurring among other U.S. ethnic groups </plain></SENT>
