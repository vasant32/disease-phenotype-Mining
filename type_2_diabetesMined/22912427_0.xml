<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To ascertain to which extent the use of HbA(1c) and oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (OGTT) for diagnosis of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance could identify individuals with different pathogenetic mechanisms and cardiovascular risk profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 844 subjects (44% men; age 49.5 ± 11 years; BMI 29 ± 5 kg/m(2)) participated in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Parameters of β-cell function were derived from deconvolution of the plasma C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> concentration after a 75-g OGTT and insulin sensitivity assessed by homeostasis model assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (IR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cardiovascular risk profile was based on determination of plasma <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> and measurements of body weight, waist circumference, and blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> regulation categories by OGTT and HbA(1c) were compared with respect to insulin action, insulin secretion, and cardiovascular risk profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: OGTT results showed 42% of the subjects had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0362046" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prediabetes</z:e> and 15% had type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM), whereas the corresponding figures based on HbA(1c) were 38 and 11%, with a respective concordance rate of 54 and 44% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subjects meeting both diagnostic criteria for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0362046" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prediabetes</z:e> presented greater IR and impairment of insulin secretion and had a worse cardiovascular risk profile than those with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance at both diagnostic methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In a logistic regression analyses adjusted for age, sex, and BMI, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0362046" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prediabetic</z:e> subjects, and even more T2DM subjects by OGTT, had greater chance to have IR and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948379" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">impaired insulin secretion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: HbA(1c) identifies a smaller proportion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0362046" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prediabetic</z:e> individuals and even a smaller proportion of T2DM individuals than OGTT, with no difference in IR, insulin secretion, and cardiovascular risk profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Subjects fulfilling both diagnostic methods for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0362046" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prediabetes</z:e> or T2DM are characterized by a worse metabolic profile </plain></SENT>
