<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Optimal management strategies for uncontrolled type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> would improve glycaemic control without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> and <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study compared the efficacy and tolerability of adding <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi>, an oral dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor, and an up to 20% increase in insulin dose in patients with uncontrolled type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> on insulin therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a 24-week, randomized, active-competitor, parallel-group study in subjects with uncontrolled type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> [<z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c (HbA1c) = 7.5-11%] currently using insulin therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subjects were randomly assigned to either the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> adding (100 mg daily, n = 70) or an insulin-increasing arm (≥ 10% at week 12 and ≥ 10% at week 24, n = 70) while continuing other medications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Average baseline HbA1c was 9.2% in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>HbA1c decreased more at 24 weeks in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> adding than the insulin-increasing arm (-0.6 ± 0.1% vs. -0.2 ± 0.1%, p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Insulin was increased by 25% at 24 weeks in the insulin-increasing group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Hypoglycaemic events were less common and less severe in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> adding arm than insulin-increasing arm (7.0 vs. 14.3 events per patient-year, p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Weight was stable in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> adding subjects (68.6 ± 11.6 vs. 68.1 ± 11.4 kg) but increased in the insulin-increasing subjects (66.2 ± 10.6 vs. 67.4 ± 9.7 kg, p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Other adverse events occurred at similar rates in both arms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Compared to a 25% increase in insulin dose, adding <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> to an insulin-based regimen was more effective at lowering HbA1c and associated with less <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> and <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> over 24 weeks </plain></SENT>
