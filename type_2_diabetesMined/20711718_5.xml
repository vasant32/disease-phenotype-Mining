<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We prospectively investigated in patients with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> whether: (1) 5L-5L is associated with mortality; (2) there is an interaction of 5L-5L with DN or sex for prediction of mortality; and (3) 5L-5L is associated with progression to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>end-stage renal disease</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ESRD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this prospective study in white European patients with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, individuals with DN were defined by persistent <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> â‰¥ 300 mg/24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Controls without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> were defined by persistent (&gt;15 years) normoalbuminuria &lt; 30 mg/24 h </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The study involved 916 patients with DN and 1,170 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During follow-up for 8.8 years, 107 patients (14%) with 5L-5L died compared with 182 patients (13.8%) with other genotypes (p = 0.99) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no significant interaction of 5L-5L with DN for prediction of mortality (p = 0.57), but a trend towards interaction with sex (p = 0.08) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: CNDP1 polymorphism was not associated with mortality, and nor was there an interaction of this polymorphism with DN for prediction of mortality in patients with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
