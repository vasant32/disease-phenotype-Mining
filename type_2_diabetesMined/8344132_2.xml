<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The present study was undertaken with the aim of evaluating the effect of multiple insulin injection therapy with an insulin pen in a large population of type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients and to investigate which factors predict a favorable response to the therapy change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We included 100 type 1 and 51 type 2 patients with a minimum <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration of 1 year who were followed for at least 3 years after changing from conventional insulin regimens to multiple insulin injection therapy with the pen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both type 1 and type 2 patients were significantly improved with respect to metabolic control at 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After 1 year type 1 patients were no longer significantly improved compared to baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In type 2 patients a significant improvement was sustained for a longer period but at 3 years HbA1c had reverted towards the baseline level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both type 1 and type 2 patients experienced a significant increase in body weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Baseline metabolic control was strongly and inversely related to subsequent decline in HbA1c in both type 1 and type 2 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Those with initial poor control had a sustained improvement throughout follow-up, whereas those with initial very good control deteriorated significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No sustained change was noted in those in intermediate control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, in type 1 patients a high body mass index at baseline was a weak negative predictor for improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In type 2 patients a longer duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was a favorable factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Both type 1 and 2 patients in poor control may be expected to benefit from multiple injection therapy </plain></SENT>
