<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our goal was to investigate if any type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> variants uncovered through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) impact BMI in childhood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Using data from an ongoing GWAS of pediatric BMI in our cohort, we investigated the association of pediatric BMI with 20 single nucleotide polymorphisms at 18 type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> loci uncovered through GWAS, consisting of ADAMTS9, CDC123-CAMK1D, CDKAL1, CDKN2A/B, EXT2, FTO, HHEX-IDE, IGF2BP2, the intragenic region on 11p12, JAZF1, KCNQ1, LOC387761, MTNR1B, NOTCH2, SLC30A8, TCF7L2, THADA, and TSPAN8-LGR5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We randomly partitioned our cohort exactly in half in order to have a discovery cohort (n = 3,592) and a replication cohort (n = 3,592) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Our data show that the major type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk-conferring G allele of rs7923837 at the HHEX-IDE locus was associated with higher pediatric BMI in both the discovery (P = 0.0013 and survived correction for 20 tests) and replication (P = 0.023) sets (combined P = 1.01 x 10(-4)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Association was not detected with any other known type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> loci uncovered to date through GWAS except for the well-established FTO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that the same genetic HHEX-IDE variant, which is associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> from previous studies, also influences pediatric BMI </plain></SENT>
