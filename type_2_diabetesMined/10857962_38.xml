<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This prospective study included 8,663 men with fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> measurements from at least two medical examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Alcohol intake was classified into five groups: nondrinkers and four quartiles (Qs) of drinkers according to the amount of alcohol intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was diagnosed by 1997 American <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Association criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 149 incident cases of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> during 52,588 person-years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a U-shaped association between alcohol intake and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, with the lowest incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> at Q2 (61.9-122.7 g/week) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As compared with Q2, men in Q3 and Q4 had a 2.2- (95% CI 1.2-3.9, P = 0.01) and 2.4-fold (1.4-4.4, P&lt;0.01) risk of developing <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, while nondrinkers and men in Q1 had 1.8- (1.0-3.3, P&lt;0.05) and 1.4-fold (0.7-2.6, P = 0.34) higher risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These associations persisted after adjustment for age, fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, smoking, BMI, blood pressure, serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> concentration, cardiorespiratory fitness, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, waist circumference, and parental <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We observed an elevated risk of developing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in nondrinkers and men with high alcohol intakes, when compared with men who reported moderate alcohol intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Men with a high alcohol intake may be able to reduce their risk of developing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> if they drink less </plain></SENT>
