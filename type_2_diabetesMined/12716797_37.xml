<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine medication adherence and predictors of suboptimal adherence in a community cohort of patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and to test the hypothesis that adherence decreases with increased number of medicines prescribed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 128 randomly selected patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> from a single community health center responded to a pharmacist-administered questionnaire regarding medication use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Survey data were linked to clinical data available from the electronic medical record </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We assessed self-reported adherence rates for each <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related medicine, barriers and attitudes regarding medication use, and HbA(1c), total cholesterol, and blood pressure levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients were taking a mean of 4.1 (+/-1.9) <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related medicines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The average 7-day adherence was 6.7 +/- 1.1 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Total number of medicines prescribed was not correlated with medication adherence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Adherence was significantly lower for medicines not felt to be improving current or future health (6.1 vs. 6.9 days out of 7, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among patients on three or more medicines, 71% (15 of 21 patients) with suboptimal adherence were perfectly adherent with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one medicine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Side effects were the most commonly reported problem with medication use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of 29 medicines causing side effects that interfered with adherence, 24 (83%) did so for &gt;1 month, and only 7 (24%) were reported to the patient's primary care physician </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this sample, patients reported very high medication adherence rates regardless of number of medicines prescribed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Among patients on multiple medicines, most patients with suboptimal adherence were perfectly adherent to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one medicine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Unreported side effects and a lack of confidence in immediate or future benefits were significant predictors of suboptimal adherence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Physicians should not feel deterred from prescribing multiple agents in order to achieve adequate control of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
