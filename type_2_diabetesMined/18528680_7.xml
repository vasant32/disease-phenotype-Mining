<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Given the positive linear correlation between NEFA released by adipocytes and plasma NEFA levels, identification of mechanisms controlling adipocyte lipolysis and NEFA release could provide a guide to new therapies for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Short hairpin <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>-mediated gene ablation was used to determine the functions of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)1 and JNK2 in adipocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Combined JNK1/JNK2 deficiency drastically increased basal <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi> release, whereas individual JNK1- or JNK2-deficiency had no effect, indicating that JNK1/JNK2-deficiency enhances basal lipolysis, whereas the alternate subtype compensates for a single JNK subtype deficiency in the regulation of basal lipolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The profoundly increased <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi> release associated with JNK1/JNK2-deficiency was not accompanied by a concomitant increase in NEFA release over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, JNK1-deficiency, but not JNK2-deficiency, drastically decreased NEFA release as compared with that in JNK-intact cells, a result of increased NEFA re-esterification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In microarray, quantitative RT-PCR and western blotting, JNK1-, JNK2- and JNK1/JNK2-deficiencies selectively upregulated many genes involved in NEFA management, without affecting the expression of genes involved in insulin signalling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Assays using reporter genes driven by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-gamma)-responsive promoters indicate distinct roles for JNK1 and JNK2 in regulating the transcriptional effects of PPAR-gamma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: While JNK1 and JNK2 have shared roles in the regulation of basal lipolysis, JNK1 has a more profound role in supporting baseline NEFA release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of JNK1 activity in adipocytes has potential therapeutic uses for management of elevated circulating NEFA levels at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
