<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We measured total body movement and five other subcomponents of physical activity by accelerometry in 258 adults (aged 30-50 years) with a family history of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We estimated aerobic fitness from an incremental treadmill exercise test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We measured body composition by bioimpedance and waist circumference, blood pressure, fasting <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and insulin with standard methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We constructed a standardized continuously distributed variable for clustered risk </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>day(-1)) was significantly and independently associated with three of six risk factors (fasting <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, insulin, and <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>) and with clustered metabolic risk (P = 0.004) after adjustment for age, sex, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Time spent at moderate- and vigorous-intensity physical activity (MPVA) was independently associated with clustered metabolic risk (P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Five- and 10-min bouts of MVPA, time spent sedentary, time spent at light-intensity activity, and aerobic fitness were not significantly related with clustered risk after adjustment for confounding factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Total body movement is associated with intermediary phenotypic risk factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025517" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic disease</z:e> and with clustered metabolic risk independent of aerobic fitness and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Increasing the total amount of physical activity in sedentary and overweight individuals may have beneficial effects on metabolic risk factors </plain></SENT>
