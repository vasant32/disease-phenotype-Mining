<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this randomized controlled trial, conducted at 7 primary care centres in central Sweden, 101 patients were randomly assigned either to empowerment group education (intervention group) or to routine <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care (control group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Out of these, 42 patients in the intervention group and 46 in the control group completed the 1-year follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Before the intervention and at the 1-year follow-up, the patients answered a 27-item questionnaire, and weight, BMI and HbA1c were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The questionnaire comprised three domains: confidence in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> knowledge, self-efficacy and satisfaction with daily life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 1-year follow-up, the level of confidence in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> knowledge was significantly higher in the intervention group than in the control group (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were found in self-efficacy, satisfaction with daily life, BMI and HbA1c between the intervention and control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The empowerment group education did improve patients' confidence in <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> knowledge with maintained glycaemic control despite the progressive nature of the disease </plain></SENT>
