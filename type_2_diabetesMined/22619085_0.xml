<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Effective physician-patient communication improves glycemia and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> self-care; however, communication gaps may exist that prevent patients from discussing self-care problems with treatment providers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We assessed diabetic patients' (n = 316, 85% white, 51% female, 71% type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, 59 ± 11 years old, 16 ± 3 years education, 19 ± 13 years <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration, and HbA(1c) = 7.9 ± 1.4%) HbA(1c), frequency of self-care, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related distress, depressive and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> symptoms, coping styles, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> quality of life, and self-care communication in the treatment relationship </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multivariate logistic regression models examined the main and interaction effects of health and psychosocial factors associated with patients' reluctance to discuss self-care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients reported positive relationships with their doctors and valued honest communication; however, 30% of patients were reluctant to discuss self-care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Reluctant patients reported less frequent self-care (P = 0.05), lower <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> quality of life (P = 0.002), and more <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related distress (P = 0.001), depressive symptoms (P &lt; 0.001), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> symptoms (P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients who reported elevated depressive symptoms, although not necessarily major <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, were more likely to be reluctant to discuss self-care (odds ratio [OR] 1.66 for 10-point change in t score; P &lt; 0.001), whereas patients who were older (OR 0.78 for 10-year change; P = 0.05) and those who used more self-controlled coping styles (OR 0.78 for 10-point change; P = 0.007) were less likely to be reluctant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Awareness of elevated depressive symptoms is important in clinical practice given that these patients may be more reluctant to discuss self-care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interventions and evidence-based approaches are needed to improve both depressive symptoms and physician-patient communication about self-care </plain></SENT>
