<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Community data on the effect of these interventions are lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Changes in the pharmacologic treatment of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, blood pressure, and cholesterol in adults with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were analyzed in a longitudinal population-based study of American Indians from 10 independent 3-year time intervals between 1975 and 2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Trends in drug use were assessed by logistic regression models and trends in glycemia, blood pressure, and cholesterol were assessed by linear models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the study participants, the use of any medicine for the treatment of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> increased from 53% in 1975-1978 to 67% in 2002-2004, Ptrend&lt;0.0001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The use of insulin as a single agent declined, and the use of combinations of insulin and oral agents increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 1990-1992, 23% of subjects had an A1C&lt;7% and by 2002-2004, the proportion had increased to 33%, Ptrend&lt;0.0001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The use of anti-hypertensive medicine increased from 21% in 1975-1977 to 58% in 2002-2004, Ptrend&lt;0.0001, coincident with a decline in mean systolic blood pressure from 137 mmHg in 1975-1977 to 123 mmHg in 2002-2004, Ptrend&lt;0.0001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The use of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-lowering medicine also increased with an accompanying increase in <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> and a decrease in non-<z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Major changes in community treatment patterns for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and related conditions coincided with improvements in glycemia, blood pressure, and cholesterol </plain></SENT>
