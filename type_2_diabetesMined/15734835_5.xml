<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested whether combined phosphorylase inactivation and glucokinase activation is a more effective strategy for controlling hepatic <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> metabolism than single-site targeting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Activation of glucokinase by enzyme overexpression combined with selective dephosphorylation of phosphorylase-a by an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35581">indole</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23004,37622">carboxamide</z:chebi> that favors the T conformation of phosphorylase caused a greater stimulation of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthesis than the sum of either treatment alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This result is explained by the complementary roles of elevated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-6-phosphate (G6P; a positive modulator) and depleted phosphorylase-a (a negative modulator) in activating <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthase and also by synergistic inactivation of phosphorylase-a by glucokinase activation and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35581">indole</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23004,37622">carboxamide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Inactivation of phosphorylase-a by the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35581">indole</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23004,37622">carboxamide</z:chebi> was counteracted by 5-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="22512">aminoimidazole</z:chebi>-4-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="23004,37622">carboxamide</z:chebi> 1-beta-D-ribofuranoside, which is metabolized to an <z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi> analog; this effect was reversed by G6P </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our findings provide further evidence for the inverse roles of G6P and <z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi> in regulating the activation state of hepatic phosphorylase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is proposed that dual targeting of glucokinase and phosphorylase-a enables improved potency and efficacy in controlling hepatic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
