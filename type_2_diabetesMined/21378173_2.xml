<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> with a relative deficiency in insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study explored the potential communication between insulin-resistant human skeletal muscle and primary (human and rat) β-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Human skeletal muscle cells were cultured for up to 24 h with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor (TNF)-α to induce <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression for cytokines was analyzed and compared with controls (without TNF-α) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Conditioned media were collected and candidate cytokines were measured by antibody array </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Human and rat primary β-cells were used to explore the impact of exposure to conditioned media for 24 h on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, proliferation, short-term insulin secretion, and key signaling protein phosphorylation and expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Human myotubes express and release a different panel of myokines depending on their insulin sensitivity, with each panel exerting differential effects on β-cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Conditioned medium from control myotubes increased proliferation and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) from primary β-cells, whereas conditioned medium from TNF-α-treated insulin-resistant myotubes (TMs) exerted detrimental effects that were either independent (<z:mp ids='MP_0006042'>increased apoptosis</z:mp> and decreased proliferation) or dependent on the presence of TNF-α in TM (blunted GSIS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Knockdown of β-cell <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein 4 kinase 4 prevented these effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> 1 protected β-cells against decreased proliferation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> evoked by TMs, while interleukin-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> only prevented the latter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these data suggest a possible new route of communication between skeletal muscle and β-cells that is modulated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and could contribute to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> β-cell functional mass in healthy subjects, as well as the decrease seen in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
