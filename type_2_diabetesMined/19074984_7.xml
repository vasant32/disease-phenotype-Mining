<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Blockade of angiotensin (Ang) II has been shown to prevent new-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We focused on the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48432">AngII</z:chebi> on muscle mitochondria, especially on their biogenesis, as an underlining mechanism of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: C2C12 cells and C57bl/6 mice were used to examine roles for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48432">AngII</z:chebi> in the regulation of muscle mitochondria and to explore whether the effect was mediated by type 1 AngII receptor (AT1R) or type 2 receptor (AT2R) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: C2C12 cells treated with 10(-8)-10(-6) mol/l <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48432">AngII</z:chebi> reduced the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> content associated with downregulation of the genes involved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> biogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The action of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48432">AngII</z:chebi> was diminished by blockade of AT2R but not AT1R, whereas overexpression of AT2R augmented the effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="48432">AngII</z:chebi> increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> ROS and decreased <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> membrane potential, and these effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48432">AngII</z:chebi> were significantly suppressed by blockade of either AT1R or AT2R </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48432">AngII</z:chebi> infusion in mice also reduced muscle <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> content in association with increased intramuscular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> and deteriorated glycemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48432">AngII</z:chebi>-induced reduction in muscle mitochondria in mice was partially, but significantly, reversed by blockade of either AT1R or AT2R, associated with increased fat oxidation, decreased muscle <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0005292'>improved glucose tolerance</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Genes involved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> biogenesis were decreased via AT2R but not AT1R under these in vivo conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these findings imply the novel roles for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48432">AngII</z:chebi> in the regulation of muscle mitochondria and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="48432">AngII</z:chebi> reduces <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> content possibly through AT1R-dependent augmentation of their degradation and AT2R-dependent direct suppression of their biogenesis </plain></SENT>
