<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Epidemiologic studies have associated low-circulating levels of this adipokine with multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025517" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic disorders</z:e> including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To investigate adiponectin-mediated changes in metabolism in vivo, we generated transgenic mice that specifically express the gene coding for human adiponectin in mouse macrophages using the human scavenger receptor A-I gene enhancer/promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Using this transgenic mouse model, we found that adiponectin expression was associated with reduced whole-animal body and fat-pad weight and an improved <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> accumulation in macrophages when these transgenic mice were fed with a high-fat diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, these macrophage Ad-TG mice exhibit enhanced whole-body <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance and insulin sensitivity with reduced proinflammatory cytokines, <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 and TNF-a (both in the serum and in the metabolic active macrophage), adipose tissue, and skeletal muscle under the high-fat diet condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additional studies demonstrated that these macrophage adiponectin transgenic animals exhibit reduced macrophage foam cell formation in the arterial wall when these transgenic mice were crossed with an <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> receptor-deficient mouse model and were fed a high-fat diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that adiponectin expressed in macrophages can physiologically modulate metabolic activities in vivo by improving metabolism in distal tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The use of macrophages as carriers for adiponectin, a molecule with antidiabetes, anti-inflammatory, and antiatherogenic properties, provides a novel and unique strategy for studying the mechanisms of adiponectin-mediated alterations in body metabolism in vivo </plain></SENT>
