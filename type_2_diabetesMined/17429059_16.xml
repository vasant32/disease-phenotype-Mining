<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of this article was to assess the association between the Alternate Healthy Eating Index (AHEI) and risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 80,029 women aged 38-63 years in the Nurses' Health Study were followed from 1984 to 2002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The AHEI score was computed from dietary information collected from five repeated food frequency questionnaires administered between 1984 and 1998 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Relative risks (RRs) for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were calculated using Cox proportional hazards models and adjusted for known <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also examined how changes in score in 4, 6-8, and 10-12 years are associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We ascertained 5,183 incident cases of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> during 18 years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Women who scored high on the AHEI had a lower risk (RR comparing top to bottom score quintile 0.64 [95% CI 0.58-0.71], P(trend) &lt; 0.0001) for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Women with consistently high AHEI scores throughout follow-up, compared with those with consistently low scores, had the lowest risk for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, women whose AHEI scores improved during follow-up, even during recent years, had a lower risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> than did women whose (low) score did not change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A higher AHEI score is associated with a lower risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the AHEI score may be a useful clinical tool to assess diet quality and to recommend for the prevention of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
