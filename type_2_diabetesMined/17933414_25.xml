<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in Japan, 151 patients with inadequate glycemic control [HbA(1c) &gt; or =6.5% to &lt;10%, fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) &gt; or =126 to &lt; or =240 mg/dL] were randomized to once-daily <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> 100mg or placebo for 12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After 12 weeks, the least squares (LS) mean change from baseline HbA(1c) was -0.65% (95% CI: -0.80, -0.50) with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> versus 0.41% (0.26, 0.56) with placebo [between-group difference=-1.05% (-1.27, -0.84); p&lt;0.001] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>LS mean change from baseline FPG was -22.5mg/dL (95% CI: -28.0, -17.0) with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> versus 9.4 mg/dL (3.9, 14.9) with placebo [between-group difference=-31.9 mg/dL (95% CI: -39.7,-24.1); p&lt;0.001] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>More patients achieved HbA(1c) &lt;7% or &lt;6.5% with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> than with placebo (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Following a meal tolerance test, 2-h postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was significantly reduced with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> relative to placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical and laboratory adverse experiences were similar between treatments, with no reported <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> adverse events with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Body weight was unchanged relative to baseline in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> group (-0.1 kg), but significantly (p&lt;0.01) different relative to the placebo group (-0.7 kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In this study, once-daily <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> 100mg for 12 weeks improved fasting and postprandial glycemic control and was generally well tolerated in Japanese patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
