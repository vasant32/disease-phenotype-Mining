<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We previously reported a family in which a heterozygous missense mutation in Akt2 led to a dominantly inherited syndrome of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000831'>insulin-resistant diabetes</z:hpo> and partial <z:hpo ids='HP_0009125'>lipodystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine whether genetic variation in AKT2 plays a broader role in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025517" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic disease</z:e>, we sequenced the entire coding region and splice junctions of AKT2 in 94 unrelated patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, 35 of whom had partial <z:hpo ids='HP_0009125'>lipodystrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two rare missense mutations (R208K and R467W) were identified in single individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, insulin-stimulated kinase activities of these variants were indistinguishable from <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In two large case-control studies (total number of participants 2,200), 0 of 11 common single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) in AKT2 showed significant association with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a quantitative trait study of 1,721 extensively phenotyped individuals from the U.K., no association was found with any relevant intermediate metabolic trait </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In summary, although heterozygous loss-of- function mutations in AKT2 can cause a syndrome of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0009125'>lipodystrophy</z:hpo> in humans, such mutations are uncommon causes of these syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, genetic variation in and around the AKT2 locus is unlikely to contribute significantly to the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or related intermediate metabolic traits in U.K. populations </plain></SENT>
