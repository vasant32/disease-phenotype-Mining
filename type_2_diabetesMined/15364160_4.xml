<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The G3238C allele (Sst I) in the 3'-untranslated region has been found to be associated with raised apo C III levels and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002155'>hypertriglyceridemia</z:hpo> (HTG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Some studies suggest that apo C III and the S(2) allele of apo C III gene are independent risk factors for atherosclerotic diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To study the potential association between these factors we analyzed the clinical data and their correlations with serum apo C III levels, apo C III gene Sst I polymorphism, and carotid intima-media thickness (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>) in 78 unrelated Chinese patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Apo C III gene Sst I polymorphism was examined using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Carotid <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> was measured by color doppler ultrasound examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serum apo C III levels were found to be positively associated with plasma TG ( r = 0.527, P &lt; 0.001), TC (r = 0.424, P &lt; 0.001), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi> (r = 0.308, P &lt; 0.01) concentrations, and carotid <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> (r =0.359, P &lt; 0.01 ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis (backward) showed that diastolic blood pressure, apo C III, and fasting insulin levels were independent risk factors of carotid <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the results did not show the association between S(2) allele and carotid <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> in our diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, our study suggested that apo C III is an independent risk factor for atherosclerotic diseases in Chinese type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
