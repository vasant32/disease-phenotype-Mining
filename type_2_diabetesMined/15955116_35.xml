<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is predicted that by 2025, India, China and the United States will have the largest number of people with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>According to the 2003 estimates of the International <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Federation, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> prevalence in the USA is 8.0% and approximately 90-95% of diabetic Americans have type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> - about 16 million people </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is a complex, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo>, polygenic disease characterized mainly by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and pancreatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0006279'>beta-cell dysfunction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Appropriate experimental models are essential tools for understanding the molecular basis, pathogenesis of the vascular and neural lesions, actions of therapeutic agents and genetic or environmental influences that increase the risks of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among the animal models available, those developed in rodents have been studied most thoroughly for reasons such as short generation time, inherited <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> in certain strains and economic considerations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this article, we review the current status of most commonly used rodent diabetic models developed spontaneously, through means of genetic engineering or artificial manipulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition to these models, the Psammomys obesus, rhesus monkeys and many other species are studied intensively and reviewed by Shafrir, Bailey and Flatt and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023343" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Hansen</z:e> </plain></SENT>
