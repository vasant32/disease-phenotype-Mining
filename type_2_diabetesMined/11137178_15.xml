<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of the 381 subjects with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> aged under 65 years, 260 (68%) participated in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On univariate analysis, HRQOL was associated with regular clinical review (check-up at least twice a year) and continuity of care (the same GP for at least 2 years), education by a <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> nurse, and satisfaction with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> education </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No associations were found between the HRQOL dimensions and home <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> monitoring, participation in educational courses, or satisfaction with care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On logistic regression analysis only good continuity of care was significantly associated with the better well-being dimensions of the SF 20 (ORs 2.5-6.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, good continuity of care was also associated with less satisfactory <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control (HbA(1c) 8.9 +/- 2.0 (+/- SD) vs 8.3 +/- 2.0%, P=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that a permanent physician-patient relationship may improve HRQOL in subjects with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, but further prospective studies are needed to confirm this finding </plain></SENT>
