<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We therefore sought to assess whether HbA(1c) adds prognostic information in relation to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality in people who have NGT and a high risk of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a Danish population-based stepwise screening programme for type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> in general practice, we identified 15,634 persons at high risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, who had NGT and a recorded HbA(1c) measurement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As comparison groups, we included 1,401 people identified as having type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and 8,149 individuals characterised as being at low risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> individuals were followed from time of screening (April 2001 to December 2006) until <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or 31 October 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Excess mortality was estimated using Cox proportional hazard models with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality as the outcome measure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with individuals with NGT and HbA(1c) below 6.0%, adjusted hazard ratios were: 1.21 (95% CI 0.95-1.56) for individuals with NGT and HbA(1c) between 6.0% and 6.5%; 2.48 (95% CI 1.23-4.99) for individuals with NGT and HbA(1c) 6.5% or above (in this group there were eight <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> among 68 individuals); 1.73 (95% CI 1.40-2.13) for individuals with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: HbA(1c) level in people with NGT and at high risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was clearly associated with increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality </plain></SENT>
