<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Cross-sectional, observational study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Health centres in North and Central Trinidad </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: One hundred and thirty-two type 2 diabetics attending the health centres for more than 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: HbA1c levels and the proportion of patients who achieve glycemic control, HbA1c pound7.0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The patients were categorized into two groups: well controlled, HbA1c Y7.0% and poorly controlled, HbA1c&gt;7.0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The majority of patients were poorly controlled (55.3%), duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> impacted negatively older patients and patients attending the clinics for longer periods were less likely to be well controlled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between pharmacological treatment, availability of individual counselling by a dietician or regular monitoring of blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and glycemic control (p&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A 44.7% of patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were found to be well controlled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Old age (51-70 years) and lengthy periods of attendance seem to be barriers to achieving glycemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This study highlights the fact that there is a need for re-evaluation of the diabetic program since despite changes in the primary care system over the past 5 years a large proportion of diabetics are still uncontrolled </plain></SENT>
