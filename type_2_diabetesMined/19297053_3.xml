<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These pathways are the PI 3-kinase-dependent pathway and the CAP/TC10 pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The adaptor protein Rap <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16235">guanine</z:chebi> exchange factor 1 (RAPGEF1) also known as C3G is a component of the CAP/TC10 pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Defects in the RAPGEF1 protein may contribute to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recently, the RAPGEF1 gene was suggested to be involved in the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> by FUSION study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To investigate this association in the Korean population, we sequenced the RAPGEF1 gene in 24 unrelated individuals and identified 39 sequence variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eleven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were selected and genotyped in 1122 Korean patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were 1138 non-diabetic controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Using a logistic regression analysis, a significant association was found between SNP rs11243444 in the RAPGEF1 gene and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> [OR=0.490 (95% CI 0.296-0.813), p=0.006] in the recessive model, leading the protective effect of the GG genotype on the disease development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The present study examines genetic polymorphisms in the RAPGEF1 gene, and the positive association between one polymorphism and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the Korean population </plain></SENT>
