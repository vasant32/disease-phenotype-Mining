<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: Several studies suggest increased mortality postcoronary angioplasty in patients on sulphonylureas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, a theoretical reduction in cardiac risk has been suggested with the newer sulphonylurea agents, which differ from the first-generation agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we investigated whether a third generation of sulphonylurea, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi>, might stimulate nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) production and thereby inhibit cytokine-induced nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB activation in endothelial cells compared with the classical sulphonylurea <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: We demonstrated that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi>, but not <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glibenclamide</z:chebi>, induces NO production in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A significant increase in endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) activity, measured in terms of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18211">citrulline</z:chebi> production, was observed with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Akt phosphorylation followed by phosphorylation of eNOS (Ser1177) was observed with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> treatment in HUVEC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, two phosphoinoside 3-kinase inhibitors, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52289">wortmannin</z:chebi> and LY294002, significantly inhibited <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi>-induced NO production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We also demonstrated inhibition of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha (TNFalpha)-induced NF-kappaB activation in HUVEC treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi>, which was attenuated by pretreatment with N(omega)-<z:chebi fb="13" ids="29785">nitro</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-arginine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">ester</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We also demonstrated a marked increase in p65 in nuclear extracts from untreated HUVEC following stimulation with TNFalpha, which was dose dependently inhibited by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi>, but not by glibenclimide in association with NF-kappaB levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These data suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi> might be a preferable sulphonylurea agent in the setting of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> because it may have protective effects on vascular endothelial cells </plain></SENT>
