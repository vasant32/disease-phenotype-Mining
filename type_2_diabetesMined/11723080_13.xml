<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The Nurses' Health Study, a prospective cohort of U.S. female registered nurses, included 7,401 women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> diagnosed at baseline or during follow-up from 1976 to 1996 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Total and cause-specific mortality of these diabetic women were the outcomes of interest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We documented 724 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> during 20 years of follow-up (67,420 person-years) among women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analyses, adjusting for age, history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002842'>high blood pressure</z:mp> and high cholesterol, and other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e>, compared with never smokers, the RRs of mortality were 1.31 (95% CI 1.11-1.55) for past smokers, 1.43 (0.96-2.14) for current smokers of 1-14 cigarettes/day, 1.64 (1.24-2.17) for current smokers of 15-34 cigarettes/day, and 2.19 (1.32-3.65) for current smokers of &gt; or =35 cigarettes/day (P for trend = 0.0002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who had stopped smoking for &gt; or =10 years had a mortality RR of 1.11 (0.92-1.35) compared with diabetic women who were never smokers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Cigarette smoking is associated in a dose-response manner with an increased mortality among women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, quitting smoking appears to decrease this excess risk substantially </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> patients should be strongly advised against smoking </plain></SENT>
