<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We examined the relationship between glycemic control, vascular reactivity, and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in type 2 diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Thirty subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were initiated on intensive insulin therapy (continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion [n = 12] or multiple daily injections [n = 18]) and then randomized to either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> (PIO group;45 mg/day), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8774">ramipril</z:chebi> (RAM group; 10 mg/day), or placebo (PLC group) for 36 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp was used to quantify <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, and plethysmography was used to assess changes in forearm blood flow (FBF) after 1) 5 min of reactive hyperemia and 2) brachial artery infusion of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> (7.5, 15, and 30 microg/min) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29321">sodium nitroprusside</z:chebi> (3 and 10 microg/min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The decreases in A1C (approximately 9.0-7.0%) and fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (approximately 190-128 mg/dl) were equal in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the PIO group, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal increased from 3.1 to 4.7 mg x kg(-1) x min(-1), and there was a greater decrease in plasma <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> ( approximately 148 vs. 123 mg/dl) and free fatty acids (approximately 838 vs. 595 mEq/l) compared with the RAM or PLC groups (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Plasma adiponectin doubled with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> treatment (6.2 +/- 0.7 to 13.1 +/- 1.8 microg/ml), while endothelin-1 decreased only with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8774">ramipril</z:chebi> treatment (2.5 +/- 0.2 to 1.1 +/- 0.2 pg/ml) (P &lt; 001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The increase in FBF during reactive hyperemia (215%) and <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> (from 132 to 205%, 216 to 262%, and 222 to 323%) was greater in the PIO versus RAM or PLC groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, FBF during <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29321">sodium nitroprusside</z:chebi> treatment was greater in the RAM group (141-221% and 218-336%) compared with the PIO or PLC groups (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8774">ramipril</z:chebi> to intensive insulin therapy in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> further improves vascular dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">Pioglitazone</z:chebi> enhances endothelial-mediated vasodilation, whereas ACE inhibition enhances endothelial-independent vasodilation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These different vascular effects, combined with the observation that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> decreases free fatty acids and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> and increases adiponectin, while <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8774">ramipril</z:chebi> reduces endothelin-1, suggest that different mechanisms underlie the vascular responses </plain></SENT>
