<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The neurogenic differentiation-1 (NEUROD1), neurogenin-3 (NEUROG3), and hepatic nuclear factor-1alpha (TCF1) genes are interacting transcription factors implicated in controlling islet cell development and insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Polymorphisms of these genes (Ala45Thr [NEUROD1], Ser199Phe [NEUROG3], and Ala98Val [TCF1]) have been postulated to influence the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have investigated the role and interaction between these variants using PCR/restriction fragment-length polymorphism assays in 454 subjects recruited as part of a population survey in South India </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additionally, 97 South Indian parent-offspring trios were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Polymorphisms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three genes were associated with either fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FBG) and/or 2-h blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (BG) in either the total dataset or when restricted to a normoglycemic population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A monotonically increasing effect, dependent on the total number of risk-associated alleles carried, was observed across the whole population (P &lt; 0.0001 for FBG and 2-h BG), raising FBG by a mean of 2.9 mmol/l and 2-h BG by a mean of 4.3 mmol/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similarly, an ascending number of the same risk alleles per subject increased the likelihood of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we observed a combined effect of variations in NEUROD1, NEUROG3, and TCF1 in contributing to overall <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> in a South Indian population </plain></SENT>
