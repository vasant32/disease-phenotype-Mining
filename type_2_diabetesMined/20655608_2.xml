<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study aimed at identifying predictors of success (retention after one year of intervention with ≥5% <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo>) in subjects at high risk for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> enrolled in a lifestyle modification program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fifty-one individuals with BMI ≥27kg/m(2) and pre-<z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> were enrolled in an individualized multidisciplinary lifestyle intervention to induce <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subjects were assessed initially with a 16-item <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight-loss</z:hpo> readiness tool (WLRT) based on stages of change model; a 6-min walk test; and anthropometric measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The most significant independent factor associated with no success was a lower result to the question "I am capable of doing more physical activity" (P=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The second significant independent predictor was ≤0.5% <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> 6 weeks after initiating intervention (P=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Excluding subjects with both criteria would have reduced by 52% the number of subjects eligible for the program, decreased the dropout rate from 30% to 17%, and increased the proportion of subjects with ≥5% <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> at one year from 51% to 80% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Importantly, only 4% of subjects would have been falsely identified as non-responders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that a practical WLRT, in combination with early <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight-loss</z:hpo> response, is helpful to identify subjects with greater chances of success to lifestyle intervention </plain></SENT>
