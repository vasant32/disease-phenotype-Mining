<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is necessary for <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in beta cells and also whether ER stress is present in islets of an animal model of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and of humans with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Expression of genes involved in ER stress was evaluated in insulin-secreting MIN6 cells exposed to elevated <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, in islets isolated from db/db mice and in pancreas sections of humans with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Overproduction of the ER chaperone heat shock 70 kDa protein 5 (HSPA5, previously known as immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein [BIP]) was performed to assess whether attenuation of ER stress affected <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We demonstrated that the pro-apoptotic fatty acid <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi> triggers a comprehensive ER stress response in MIN6 cells, which was virtually absent using non-apoptotic fatty acid <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30823">oleate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Time-dependent increases in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels for activating transcription factor 4 (Atf4), DNA-damage inducible transcript 3 (Ddit3, previously known as C/EBP homologous protein [Chop]) and DnaJ homologue (HSP40) C3 (Dnajc3, previously known as p58) correlated with <z:mp ids='MP_0006042'>increased apoptosis</z:mp> in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi>- but not in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30823">oleate</z:chebi>-treated MIN6 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Attenuation of ER stress by overproduction of HSPA5 in MIN6 cells significantly protected against <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In islets of db/db mice, a variety of marker genes of ER stress were also upregulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Increased processing (activation) of X-box binding protein 1 (Xbp1) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was also observed, confirming the existence of ER stress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Finally, we observed increased islet protein production of HSPA5, DDIT3, DNAJC3 and BCL2-associated X protein in human pancreas sections of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our results provide evidence that ER stress occurs in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and is required for aspects of the underlying beta cell failure </plain></SENT>
