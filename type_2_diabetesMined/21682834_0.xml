<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Bone mineral density (BMD) and bone biomarkers were evaluated in a subgroup of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a phase IV, randomized, double-blind, multi-centre study in 688, drug naÏve, male and female patients who had an established clinical diagnosis of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were randomized in a 1 : 1 ratio either to <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> or MET </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: As initial therapy in patients with T2DM, <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> was superior to MET in achieving statistically significant reductions in glycated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbA1c) (p &lt; 0.0001) and fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) (p &lt; 0.001), with more patients reaching recommended HbA1c and FPG targets for intensive glycaemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The glycaemic effects attained with <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> compared to MET monotherapy were durable over 18 months of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the bone substudy, <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> was associated with a significantly lower BMD in comparison with MET at week 80 in the lumbar spine and total hip (p &lt; 0.0012 and p = 0.0005, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Between-treatment differences were not statistically significant for distal one-third of radius BMD, femoral neck BMD or total BMD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Superior glycaemic control was achieved with <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> compared with MET monotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The superior glycaemic effects were shown to be durable over 18 months of treatment </plain></SENT>
