<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Due to a background of high prevalence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and the increasing rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> occurring in relatively young urban children, we felt the need to look for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A study of cases of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with age at diagnosis of &lt;/=15 years seen at a <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> speciality center in Chennai, India, is reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 18 children (5 boys and 13 girls) aged 9-15 years with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003587'>insidious onset</z:hpo> of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> responding to oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> agents (ODAs) for periods from 2 months to 12 years were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical details, anthropometry, and details of family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were elicited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of them were tested for the presence of anti-GAD(65) antibodies and for pancreatic beta-cell reserve by measuring serum C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> response (radioimmunoassay procedures) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> children showed a response to ODAs, had good beta-cell reserve (&gt;/=0.6 pmol/ml on stimulation), and negligible GAD(65) antibodies indicating the presence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The children were nonketotic; nine were <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp>, four had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000956'>acanthosis nigricans</z:hpo>, and one had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000147'>polycystic ovary</z:hpo> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Positive family history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The clinical, immunological, and biochemical profile showed that the children had type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The profile of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was similar to that described in children in many other countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although less common than type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in children is a condition that needs to be recognized and looked for in Asian-Indians </plain></SENT>
