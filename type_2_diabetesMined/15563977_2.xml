<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> has increased worldwide over the past decades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The economic and social cost associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and its complications have also increased enormously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since current methods of treating <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is inadequate, the most effective way to reduce the burden associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> would be to prevent <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> itself </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Current strategies to prevent type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> are based on efforts to reduce <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> and to preserve or increase pancreatic beta cell function in high risk individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Now there is substantial evidence that life style intervention or pharmacologic agents can reduce the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in individuals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, it remains to be determined whether the result would be similar in other risk groups for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although development of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> is influenced by a complex interaction between genetic and environmental factors, current prevention strategies do not reflect contribution of genetic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Over the past decade, many investigators tried to find diabetogenic genes by traditional gene discovery methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It appears that multiple genes with weak effect are involved in the development of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> which makes searching diabetogenic genes more complicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition to the completion of human genome project, new genetic tools to identify genetic variations and analyze gene to gene or gene to environmental interaction will facilitate the discovery of susceptibility genes for type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> in near future </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Once we could identify susceptibility genes and gene to environmental interaction of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, we can clarify the role of both environmental and genetic factors in the development of type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we can identify people who can get more benefit from prevention and also can provide better and personalized preventive measure based on genetic information </plain></SENT>
