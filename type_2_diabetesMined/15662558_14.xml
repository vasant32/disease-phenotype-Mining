<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eight type 2 diabetic patients, who were aged 62 years (median range: 49-68 years) and managed by diet alone, consumed a meal containing 65 g powdered potato, 20 g <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> reconstituted with 200 ml water (labelled with 20 MBq (99m)Tc-sulphur-colloid) and 45 g margarine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They did this on two separate occasions, with and without 120 mg orlistat, and while in the seated position with their back against a gamma camera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Venous blood samples for measurement of blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, plasma insulin and GLP-1 were obtained immediately before the meal and at regular intervals afterwards </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Blood pressure (systolic and diastolic) and heart rate were measured using an automated device </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Gastric emptying of the meal was faster after orlistat than without orlistat (50% emptying time [mean +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>], 61+/-8 min vs 98+/-5 min; p=0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the first 60 min after the meal blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (p=0.001) and plasma insulin (p=0.01) concentrations were higher in patients who had taken orlistat; between 60 and 180 min plasma GLP-1 (p=0.02) concentrations were lower after orlistat than without orlistat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Between 0 and 30 min systolic blood pressure (p=0.003) was lower, and heart rate (p=0.03) greater in subjects who had taken orlistat than in those who had not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Inhibition of fat digestion by orlistat may-as a result of more rapid gastric emptying-exacerbate postprandial glycaemia and the postprandial fall in blood pressure in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> after ingestion of meals containing fat and carbohydrate </plain></SENT>
