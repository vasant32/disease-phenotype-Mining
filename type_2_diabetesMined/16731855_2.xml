<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recently, it has been shown that mutations in the P2 promoter of the hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-4 alpha gene (HNF4A) cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0004904'>maturity-onset diabetes of the young</z:hpo> (MODY), while single nucleotide polymorphisms in this locus are associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined 1,189 bp of the P2 promoter and the associated exon 1D of HNF4A for variations associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in 114 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, 72 MODYX probands, and 85 women with previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>gestational diabetes</z:hpo> mellitus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A -192c/g mutation was found in five patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We screened 1,587 diabetic subjects and 4,812 glucose-tolerant subjects for the -192c/g mutation and identified 5 diabetic and 1 glucose-tolerant mutation carriers (P=0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Examination of the families showed that carriers of the -192c/g mutation had a significantly impaired <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated insulin release and lower levels of serum total cholesterol compared with matched control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the mutation disrupted the binding of an unidentified sequence-specific DNA binding complex present in human islet extracts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Also, two novel linked polymorphisms in the P2 promoter at positions -1107g/t and -858c/t were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These variants were not significantly associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or any <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0362046" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pre-diabetic</z:e> traits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, a rare, novel mutation that disrupts a protein binding site in the pancreatic HNF4A promoter associates with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
