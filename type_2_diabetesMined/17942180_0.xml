<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using data from the 75-g oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (OGTT), 115 subjects were divided into 3 groups: 40 with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance, 34 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo>, and 41 with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The new insulin sensitivity index: oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> insulin sensitivity index (GSI) was calculated from five sets of plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin levels obtained at 0, 30, 60, 90 and 120 min during OGTT using a formula based on an autoregressive model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Forty-three of the 115 subjects were examined for insulin sensitivity index (ISI) by euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>GSI decreased in the order of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance group&gt;<z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> group&gt;diabetic group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a significant correlation between GSI and the ISI derived from euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp study data in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 43 subjects who underwent both tests (r=0.72; P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The ISI calculated by previous methods poorly correlated with the ISIs obtained by euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, this new insulin sensitivity index based on the data obtained from OGTT using an autoregressive model is comparable to an insulin sensitivity index by euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp technique and may be superior to previous indexes that have been devised to determine insulin sensitivity from OGTT data </plain></SENT>
