<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, adherence to combined resistance and endurance type exercise or medical fitness intervention programmes is generally poor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Group-based brisk walking may represent an attractive alternative, but its long-term efficacy as compared with an individualised approach such as medical fitness intervention programmes is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We compared the clinical benefits of a 12-month exercise intervention programme consisting of either brisk walking or a medical fitness programme in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We randomised 92 type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients (60 +/- 9 years old) to either three times a week of 60 min brisk walking (n = 49) or medical fitness programme (n = 43) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Primary outcome was the difference in changes in HbA1c values at 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Secondary outcomes were differences in changes in blood pressure, plasma <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> concentrations, insulin sensitivity, body composition, physical fitness, programme adherence rate and health-related quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After 12 months, 18 brisk walking and 19 medical fitness participants were still actively participating </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In both programmes, 50 and 25% of the dropout was attributed to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035127" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="RSI">overuse injuries</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000745'>lack of motivation</z:hpo>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Intention-to-treat analyses showed no important differences between brisk walking and medical fitness programme in primary or secondary outcome variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The prescription of group-based brisk walking represents an equally effective intervention to modulate glycaemic control and cardiovascular risk profile in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> patients when compared with more individualised medical fitness programmes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Future exercise intervention programmes should anticipate the high attrition rate due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035127" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="RSI">overuse injuries</z:e> and motivation problems </plain></SENT>
