<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> is characterized by decreased levels of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> 6-phosphate in skeletal muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested that the lower concentrations of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> 6-phosphate contribute to the defect in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism noted in muscle tissue of subjects with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or subjects at increased risk of developing Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Lower levels of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> 6-phosphate could be due to a defect in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> uptake, or phosphorylation, or both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hexokinase II is the isozyme of hexokinase that is expressed in skeletal muscle and is responsible for catalysing the phosphorylation of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> in this tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The recent demonstration that mutations in another member of this family of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> phosphorylating enzymes, glucokinase, can lead to the development of Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> prompted us to begin to examine the possible role of hexokinase II in the development of this genetically <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As a first step, we have cloned the human hexokinase II gene (HK2) and mapped it to human chromosome 2, band p13.1, by fluorescence in situ hybridization to metaphase chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, we have identified and characterized a simple tandem repeat DNA polymorphism in HK2 and used this DNA polymorphism to localize this gene within the genetic linkage map of chromosome 2 </plain></SENT>
