<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: During the year 2000 we did a survey among sentinel practitioners who registered information about previously and newly diagnosed Type 2 diabetic patients older than 24 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied 65,651 people attending a primary care service in the Basque Country Health Service-Osakidetza </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We collected information about <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271672" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic complications</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> and measured the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> risk in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the year 2000, the standardized cumulative incidence and prevalence of known Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were 5.0 per 1000 (CI 95%: 4.9-5.1) and 4.6% (CI 95%: 4.5-4.7) respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096293" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Macroangiopathy</z:e> was the most frequent complication both in the newly diagnosed (21.6%) and previously known Type 2 diabetic patients (33%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Total cholesterol &gt; or =5.17 mmol/l and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> &gt; or =2.58 mmol/l were found in 75% and 90% of newly diagnosed and 65% and 85% of previously diagnosed Type 2 diabetic patients respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the Type 2 diabetic patients 42% were <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> and 80% had <z:mp ids='MP_0002842'>high blood pressure</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>More than 55% of the men compared with 44% of the women with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> had high or very high risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: We report new epidemiological data on known Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the Basque Country </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These patients have a high frequency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> causing a high <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> risk </plain></SENT>
