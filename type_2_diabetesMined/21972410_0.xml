<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Participants in ADVANCE were drawn from many countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined whether the effects of intensive glycemic control on major outcomes in ADVANCE differ between participants from Asia, established market economies (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EMEs</z:e>), and eastern Europe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: ADVANCE was a clinical trial of 11,140 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, lasting a median of 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Demographic and clinical characteristics were compared across regions using generalized linear and mixed models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Effects on outcomes of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31654">gliclazide</z:chebi> modified release-based intensive <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control regimen, targeting an HbA(lc) of ≤6.5%, were compared across regions using Cox proportional hazards models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: When differences in baseline variables were allowed for, the risks of primary outcomes (major macrovascular or microvascular disease) were highest in Asia (joint hazard ratio 1.33 [95% CI 1.17-1.50]), whereas macrovascular disease was more common (1.19 [1.00-1.42]) and microvascular disease less common (0.77 [0.62-0.94]) in eastern Europe than in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EMEs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Risks of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and cardiovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were highest in eastern Europe, and the mean difference in glycosylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> between the intensive and standard groups was lowest in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EMEs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Despite these and other differences, the effects of intensive glycemic control were not significantly different (P ≥ 0.23) between regions for any outcome, including mortality, vascular end points, and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001988'>hypoglycemic episodes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Irrespective of absolute risk, the effects of intensive glycemic control with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31654">gliclazide</z:chebi> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>-based regimen used in ADVANCE were similar across Asia, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EMEs</z:e>, and eastern Europe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This regimen can safely be recommended for patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of these regions </plain></SENT>
