<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To that end, we performed a 5-year follow-up study of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> type 2 diabetic patients attending the outpatient-clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 444 (98.4%) out of 451 adult patients initially studied were evaluated for the degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> and levels of HbA1c blood pressure, serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> and urinary albumin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Vascular morbidity and causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were registered by one and the most severe event only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Forty-seven patients developed atherosclerotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e>, i.e. <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (n = 19), cerebrovascular disease (n = 20), or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_686'>amputation</z:mpath> (n = 8), and 42 died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The observed annual mortality rate was 22.1/1000 compared to an expected rate of 13.6/1000 for the general population with corresponding age and sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Urinary albumin concentration was found to be a prognostic marker for the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in patients treated with insulin at baseline (P &lt; 0.01), whereas this was not the case in patients treated with diet and/or oral agents at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, insulin treatment per se was not associated with an increased mortality or mortality or morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Urinary albumin concentration was not correlated with incidence or progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> regardless of type of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, this study showed that <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> was a prognostic factor for vascular morbidity and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in type 2 diabetic patients treated with insulin but not in patients treated with diet or oral agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:mp ids='MP_0002871'>albuminuria</z:mp> was not a predictor for incidence or progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
