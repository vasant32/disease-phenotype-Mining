<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Detailed metabolic studies were carried out to compare major regulatory steps in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism in vivo between 25 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pregnant Latino women without and 150 pregnant Latino women with <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>gestational diabetes</z:hpo> mellitus (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The two groups were frequency-matched for age, BMI, and gestational age at testing in the third trimester </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After an overnight fast, women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> had higher fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (P = 0.0001) and immunoreactive insulin (P = 0.0003) concentrations and higher <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production rates (P = 0.01) but lower <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> clearance rates (P = 0.001) compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pregnant women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During steady-state <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> (approximately 600 pmol/l) and euglycemia (approximately 4.9 mmol/l), women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> had lower <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> clearance rates (P = 0.0001) but higher <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production rates (P = 0.0001) and plasma free fatty acid (FFA) concentrations (P = 0.0002) than the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These intergroup differences persisted when a subgroup of 116 women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> who were not diabetic &lt; or = 6 months after pregnancy were used in the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects were considered, there was a very close correlation between <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production rates and plasma FFA concentrations throughout the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> clamps in control (r = 0.996) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> (r = 0.995) groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Slopes and intercepts of the relationships were nearly identical, suggesting that blunted suppression of FFA concentrations contributed to blunted suppression of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition to these defects in insulin action, women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> had a 67% impairment of pancreatic beta-cell compensation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pregnant women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GDM</z:e> have multiple defects in insulin action together with impaired compensation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that defects in the regulation of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> clearance, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> production, and plasma FFA concentrations, together with defects in pancreatic beta-cell function, precede the development of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in these high-risk women </plain></SENT>
