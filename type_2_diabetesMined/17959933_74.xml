<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Recently, genome-wide association studies have provided evidence that several common variants within the fat mass-and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>-associated (FTO) gene were significantly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> in populations of European origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, their effects in other ethnic populations remain to be elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In this study, we examined the association between three FTO variants (rs8050136, rs9939609, and rs9930506) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and related traits in a population-based study of 3,210 unrelated Chinese Han subjects from Shanghai and Beijing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In secondary analyses, we also tested for association with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and related traits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Logistics regression and generalized linear models were used to test for additive and dominant effects of the risk alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The minor allele frequencies of rs8050136, rs9939609, and rs9930506 in our population (0.12, 0.12, and 0.20, respectively) were substantially lower than those observed for populations of European descent (e.g., for CEU population of HapMap: 0.45, 0.48, and 0.45, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Despite our study being sufficiently powered to detect effects similar to those previously reported, none of the FTO SNPs were found to be associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, overweight, BMI, waist circumference, or body fat percentage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, none of the SNPs exhibited significant associations with fasting levels of plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, A1C, insulin, or beta-cell function (estimated via homeostasis model assessment) under either an additive or a dominant model in the quantitative trait analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Analyses stratified by sex or geographical region did not change these observations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data do not support that the FTO common variants are major contributors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the Chinese Han population </plain></SENT>
