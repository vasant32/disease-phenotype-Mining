<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although it is widely acknowledged that <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> is a risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo>, the increased prevalence of potentially lethal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001711'>left ventricular abnormalities</z:hpo> in this population is less well appreciated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We carried out an echocardiographic study of 500 subjects with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> to assess the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001712'>left ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo> (LVH) and left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also assessed whether abnormalities in diastolic filling parameters were present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 371 patients in whom left ventricular mass could be successfully assessed, 264 had LVH (71%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Left ventricular systolic dysfunction was much less common, being present in 16/385 patients (4.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Long axis contraction was abnormal in 29/429 patients (6.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Diastolic filling abnormalities were present in 178/435 (41%) of patients who could be classified using the selected criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001711'>left ventricular abnormalities</z:hpo> are common in type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>As medical therapy is available for both LVH and LVSD and has been demonstrated to reduce cardiovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, these <z:hpo ids='HP_0001711'>left ventricular abnormalities</z:hpo> could be ideal targets for screening, followed by selective therapeutic intervention </plain></SENT>
