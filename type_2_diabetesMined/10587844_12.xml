<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We evaluated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver disease</z:e> in conventionally treated type 2 diabetic patients to provide a reference against which reports of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver disease</z:e> related to novel oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> treatments could be compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In this follow-up study, patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who were treated with oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> agents were identified from the U.K.-based General Practice Research Database and were followed to determine whether they developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The specific types and etiologies of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver disorders</z:e> were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Incidence rates were calculated based on the accumulated exposure time to oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 44,406 type 2 diabetic patients, 605 had a computer diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver disease</z:e> with an incidence rate of 53.2/10,000 person-years (95% CI 49.2-57.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the 605 subjects, 186 had nonsymptomatic, mild, and transient <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver disorders</z:e>; 249 had a predisposing condition; and 113 had another cause for the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total of 57 cases were possibly drug induced with an incidence rate of 5.0/10,000 person-years (3.9-6.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the cases, 11 were attributed to other drugs, 8 were attributed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>fatty liver</z:hpo> disease of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and the remaining cases were attributed to uncertain causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> agents were continued in 51 of these 57 cases, and we could not rule out oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> agents as a cause of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver disease</z:e> in 2 cases with an incidence rate of 0.2/10,000 person-years (&lt; 0.1-0.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this population, the background incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver disease</z:e> was high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Most cases involved other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442893" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">systemic diseases</z:e> that may cause <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
