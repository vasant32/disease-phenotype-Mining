<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Alterations in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> metabolism have also been observed clinically in diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with either type 1 or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who have signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>renal dysfunction</z:hpo> tend to exhibit elevated total plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> levels, whereas type 1 diabetic patients who have no clinical signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>renal dysfunction</z:hpo> have lower than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to investigate <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> metabolism in a type 1 diabetic animal model and to examine whether insulin plays a role in its regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> was induced by intravenous administration of 100 mg/kg <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi> to Sprague-Dawley rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We observed a 30% reduction in plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> in the untreated diabetic rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This decrease in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> was prevented when diabetic rats received insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Transsulfuration and remethylation enzymes were measured in both the liver and the kidney </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We observed an increase in the activities of the hepatic transsulfuration enzymes (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17755">cystathionine</z:chebi> beta-synthase and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17755">cystathionine</z:chebi> gamma-lyase) in the untreated diabetic rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Insulin treatment normalized the activities of these enzymes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The renal activities of these enzymes were unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that insulin is involved in the regulation of plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> concentrations by affecting the hepatic transsulfuration pathway, which is involved in the catabolism of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
