<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinical trial data from large, controlled studies demonstrate the safety and efficacy of liraglutide in terms of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A(1c) (HbA(1c)) reduction, reductions in body weight, and the drug's low risk for hypoglycemic events when used as monotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Liraglutide has been studied as monotherapy and in combination with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5383">glimepiride</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50122">rosiglitazone</z:chebi> for the treatment of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additionally, comparative data with insulin glargine and exenatide therapy are available from Phase III trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Once-daily administration may provide a therapeutic advantage for liraglutide over twice-daily exenatide, with similar improvements in HbA(1c) and body weight observed when liraglutide was compared with exenatide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-dependent mechanism of insulin release with incretin analog therapy holds potential clinical significance in the management of postprandial hyperglycemic excursions, with minimal risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> when used with non-secretagogue medications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Data to date on patient-reported outcomes with liraglutide treatment are encouraging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most common adverse events associated with liraglutide therapy are dose-dependent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Diligent postmarketing surveillance to elucidate the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001733'>pancreatitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002865'>medullary thyroid carcinoma</z:hpo> in a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> population are likely warranted </plain></SENT>
