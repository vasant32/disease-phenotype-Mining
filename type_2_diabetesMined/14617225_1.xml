<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To further characterize the properties of 1,4-dideoxy-1,4-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29342">imino</z:chebi>-d-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="22605">arabinitol</z:chebi> (DAB), a recently described novel and potent inhibitor of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> phosphorylase and potential anti-diabetic agent, we have determined its pharmacokinetic properties in rats, dogs and mice and compared these to its pharmacodynamic anti-hyperglycaemic efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male Sprague Dawley rats, beagle dogs and diabetic Ume√• ob/ob mice were administered DAB or <z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>-DAB at various doses and by different routes and in either the conscious or the unconscious state and with or without glucagon, as appropriate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At different time points thereafter, blood, tissue and urine samples were withdrawn for analyses of DAB or <z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>-DAB, and blood samples were taken for <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: DAB suppressed the blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> excursion in glucagon-challenged rats with an ID100 of 1-2 mg/kg per orally and intravenously and had a pharmacodynamic t50 for 1.6 mg/kg intravenously and for 1.2 mg/kg per orally of 50 and 60 min respectively </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>2 mg/kg DAB in rats revealed elimination half-lives of 25 min after intravenous (i.v.) and 49 min after per oral (p.o.) administration; the oral bioavailability was 89% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In rats, DAB was distributed preferentially in liver vs. skeletal muscle and was eliminated predominantly through urine as parent compound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The pharmacokinetics of 4 mg/kg DAB in dogs showed elimination half-lives of 107 min after i.v. and 129 min after p.o. administration with an estimated oral availability of 78% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At 4 mg/kg DAB p.o., glucagon-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> in dogs was reduced in a time-dependent manner with an estimated t50 of 4 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DAB was very rapidly cleared in mice; nevertheless, a dose-dependent reduction of blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> of up to 9 mmol/l was seen in diabetic ob/ob mice dosed subcutaneously, with statistically significant effects evident from 30 to 120 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data show that DAB is nearly completely orally available in rats and dogs and that it can reduce glucagon-induced and spontaneous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
