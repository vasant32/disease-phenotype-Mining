<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Different studies provide evidence that <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> may play a functional role in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance through its effects on insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study evaluates the effects of <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> supplementation on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in T2DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Through a before-after study, 100 patients with T2DM, 30-70 years old, were recruited from an Arak <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> clinic as consecutive attenders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Participants were assessed for clinical and biochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serum insulin and, 25(OH)D concentration, and HOMA-IR was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> measurements were performed at the beginning and the end of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients received 50,000 unit of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28940">vitamin D3</z:chebi> orally per week for eight weeks, Statistical analysis was made using SPSS17 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results were analyzed by descriptive tests, and a comparison between variables were made using paired T-tests or Wilcoxon tests, as appropriate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 100 participants including 70 women (70%) and 30 men (30%) took part in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> results were presented as Mean±SD, or medians of non-normally distributed.24% of the participants were <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">Vitamin D</z:chebi> deficient {serum 25(OH)D ≤ 20 ng/ml(50 nmol/l)}.Mean serum 25 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29191">(OH)</z:chebi> D concentration was 43.03± 19.28 ng/ml (107.5±48.2 nmol/l).The results at baseline and at the end, for FPG were 138.48±36.74 and 131.02±39 mg/dl (P=0.05), for insulin, 10.76±9.46 and 8.6±8.25 μIu/ml (P=0.028) and for HOMA-IR, 3.57±3.18 and 2.89±3.28 (P=0.008) respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our data showed significant improvements in serum FPG, insulin and in HOMA-IR after treatment with <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi>, suggested that <z:chebi fb="27" ids="27300">vitamin D</z:chebi> supplementation could reduce <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in T2DM </plain></SENT>
