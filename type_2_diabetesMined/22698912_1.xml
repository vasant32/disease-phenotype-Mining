<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined genetic variants associated with bone mineral density (BMD) for association with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and glycemic traits in large well-phenotyped and -genotyped consortia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We undertook follow-up analysis in ∼19,000 individuals and assessed gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We queried single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with BMD at levels of genome-wide significance, variants in linkage disequilibrium (r(2) &gt; 0.5), and BMD candidate genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SNP rs6867040, at the ITGA1 locus, was associated with a 0.0166 mmol/L (0.004) increase in fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> per C allele in the combined analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Genetic variants in the ITGA1 locus were associated with its expression in the liver but not in adipose tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ITGA1 variants appeared among the top loci associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, fasting insulin, β-cell function by homeostasis model assessment, and 2-h post-oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>ITGA1 has demonstrated genetic pleiotropy in prior studies, and its suggested role in <z:mp ids='MP_0003333'>liver fibrosis</z:mp>, insulin secretion, and bone healing lends credence to its contribution to both <z:hpo ids='HP_0000939'>osteoporosis</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings further underscore the link between skeletal and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism and highlight a locus to direct future investigations </plain></SENT>
