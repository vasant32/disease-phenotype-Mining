<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To study the role of NEFA in the prompt normalisation of beta cell <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> sensitivity, insulin secretion and beta cell <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> metabolism were investigated by a model of nutrient-stimulated insulin secretion using a multiple-meal test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Hourly <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> and NEFA were measured in nine morbidly <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp>, type 2 diabetic patients before and 1 week after bariatric surgery and in six matched healthy volunteers over 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A mathematical model of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-NEFA comodulation of insulin secretion rate (ISR) was used to compute ISR and beta-oxidation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Insulin sensitivity was measured by an OGTT minimal model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Beta cell sensitivity to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and NEFA was doubled after surgery, while the 24 h insulin secretion decreased from 277.1 +/- 144.4 to 198.0 +/- 107.6 nmol/m(2) (p &lt; 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Insulin sensitivity was restored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The beta-oxidation rate of beta cells was completely normalised (from 0.032 +/- 0.012 x 10(-12) to 0.103 +/- 0.031 x 10(-12) mmol/min per cell, p &lt; 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The best predictor of beta cell function improvement was the duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Bariatric surgery in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> restores beta-oxidation in beta cells, doubles <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-NEFA sensitivity and reverses <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It is likely that ISR is reduced to match insulin-sensitivity normalisation, in spite of no significant reduction in NEFA levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We hypothesise that insulin sensitivity normalisation might appear as a consequence of nutrient exclusion from proximal intestinal transit, and that secondarily the need for insulin secretion diminishes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The insulin sensitivity increase is much higher than usually obtained by insulin-sensitising agents and is independent of weight changes </plain></SENT>
