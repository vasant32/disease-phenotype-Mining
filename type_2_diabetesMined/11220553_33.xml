<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To determine the efficacy and tolerability of sibutramine <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi> in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients whose type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was poorly controlled on diet alone or with an oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study was a 24-week, double-blind, multicentre trial following a 5-week placebo run-in period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One hundred and seventy-five <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> (body mass index (b.m.i.) &gt; or =27 kg/m2) patients with poorly controlled type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> were randomized either to sibutramine (n = 89; mean age 53.5 years; mean weight 99.3 kg) or placebo (n = 86; mean age 55 years; mean weight 98.2 kg) at 16 participating centres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To achieve moderate calorie restriction (deficit &gt; or = 250-500 kcal/day), individual dietary counselling was accompanied by either placebo or sibutramine (initial dosage of 5 mg/day titrated up by 5 mg biweekly through week 6, and maintained at 20 mg through week 24) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The main outcome measures included changes in weight, b.m.i., waist and hip circumference, glycaemic control, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile, and quality of life, and evaluation of reported adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixty-seven per cent of sibutramine patients and 71% of placebo patients completed the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At week 24 when comparing those who completed the course, sibutramine compared with placebo patients showed significantly greater (p &lt; 0.001) absolute (-4.3 vs. -0.4 kg) and percentage (-4.5% vs. -0.5%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>Weight loss</z:hpo> &gt; or =5% or 10% was achieved by 33% and 8% of sibutramine patients, respectively, but no placebo patients (p &lt; 0.03 or better) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Improvement in glycaemic control was correlated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 5% and 10% <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight-loss</z:hpo> responders, mean treatment differences were -0.53% and -1.65% (p &lt; or = 0.05), respectively, for HbA1c, and -1.4 mmol/l (p &lt; or =0.05) and -3.8 (p &lt; or =0.05) mmol/l for fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Sibutramine patients also showed improvements in fasting insulin, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, and quality-of-life assessments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Overall, sibutramine was well tolerated compared with the placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Sibutramine treatment was associated with small mean increases in blood pressure (BP) and pulse, although an increase in BP was not seen in sibutramine-treated patients who lost &gt; or = 5% of their weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Sibutramine produced statistically and clinically significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> when used in combination with recommendations for moderate caloric restriction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> was associated with improvements in metabolic control and quality of life, and sibutramine was generally well tolerated in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
