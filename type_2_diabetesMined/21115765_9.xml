<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Prepregnancy care was promoted among patients and health professionals and delivered across 10 regional maternity units </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A prospective cohort study of 680 pregnancies in women with type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Primary outcomes were adverse pregnancy outcome (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1705254" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">congenital malformation</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003826'>stillbirth</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0003811'>neonatal death</z:hpo>), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1705254" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">congenital malformation</z:e>, and indicators of pregnancy preparation (5 mg <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi>, gestational age, and A1C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Comparisons were made with a historical cohort (n = 613 pregnancies) from the same units during 1999-2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 181 (27%) women attended, and 499 women (73%) did not attend prepregnancy care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Women with prepregnancy care presented earlier (6.7 vs. 7.7 weeks; P &lt; 0.001), were more likely to take 5 mg preconception <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi> (88.2 vs. 26.7%; P &lt; 0.0001) and had lower A1C levels (A1C 6.9 vs. 7.6%; P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>They had fewer adverse pregnancy outcomes (1.3 vs. 7.8%; P = 0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariate logistic regression confirmed that in addition to glycemic control, lack of prepregnancy care was independently associated with adverse outcome (odds ratio 0.2 [95% CI 0.05-0.89]; P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Compared with 1999-2004, <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi> supplementation increased (40.7 vs. 32.5%; P = 0.006) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1705254" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">congenital malformations</z:e> decreased (4.3 vs. 7.3%; P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Regional prepregnancy care was associated with improved pregnancy preparation and reduced risk of adverse pregnancy outcome in type 1 and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Prepregnancy care had benefits beyond improved glycemic control and was a stronger predictor of pregnancy outcome than maternal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, ethnicity, or social disadvantage </plain></SENT>
