<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This prospective open-cohort study used primary-care data from 36,127 people with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> without previous <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> to derive a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> equation using Cox proportional hazards regression models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data from 12,626 people from a geographically different area were used for validation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Outcome measure was time to first fatal or nonfatal cardiovascular event, derived from national hospitalization and mortality records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Risk factors were age at diagnosis, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration, sex, systolic blood pressure, smoking status, total cholesterol-to-<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> ratio, ethnicity, glycated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (A1C), and urine albumin-to-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Baseline median age was 59 years, 51% were women, 55% were of non-European ethnicity, and 33% had micro- or macroalbuminuria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median follow-up was 3.9 years (141,169 person-years), including 10,030 individuals followed for at least 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At total of 6,479 first cardiovascular events occurred during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The 5-year observed risk was 20.8% (95% CI 20.3-21.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Risk increased with each 1% A1C (adjusted hazard ratio 1.06 [95% CI 1.05-1.08]), when macroalbuminuria was present (2.04 [1.89-2.21]), and in Indo-Asians (1.29 [1.14-1.46]) and Maori (1.23 [1.14-1.32]) compared with Europeans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The derived risk equations performed well on the validation cohort compared with other risk equations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Renal function, ethnicity, and glycemic control contribute significantly to cardiovascular risk prediction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Population-appropriate risk equations can be derived from routinely collected data </plain></SENT>
