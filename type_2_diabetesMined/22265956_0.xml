<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 2257 type 2 diabetic patients with at least 6 months of oral <z:chebi fb="30" ids="27777">AHA</z:chebi> were enrolled in China, Korea, Malaysia, Thailand, and Taiwan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Quality of life was measured with the EuroQol Visual Analog Scale (EQ-VAS) and EuroQol-5 Dimensions questionnaire (EQ-5D), and worry about <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> with the worry subscale of the Hypoglycemic Fear Survey-II (HFS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean (SD) age was 58.7 (10.2) years and HbA(1c) was 7.5% (1.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The proportion of patients with an HbA(1c) &lt;6.5% and &lt;7% was 24.9% and 41.8%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hypoglycemic symptoms in the prior 6 months were reported by 35.8% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean scores on the EQ-VAS and the EQ-5D were significantly lower for patients who had hypoglycemic symptoms compared to those who did not (73.6 vs. 76.9, p&lt;0.001; 0.88 vs. 0.90, p&lt;0.0001, respectively), whereas mean score on the HFS was significantly higher (12.5 vs. 6.3, p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In multivariate models, hypoglycemic symptoms were independently associated with scores on the EQ-5D, EQ-VAS, and HFS (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> p ≤ 0.01-0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Symptom severity was positively associated with fear of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> p ≤ 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Hypoglycemic symptoms were associated with reduced quality of life and increased patient worry in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> treated with <z:chebi fb="30" ids="27777">AHA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
