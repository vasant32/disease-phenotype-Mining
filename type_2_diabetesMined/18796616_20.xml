<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, circulating RBP4 levels are also affected by kidney function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the aim of this study was to test whether RBP4 serum levels are primarily associated with kidney function or type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: RBP4 serum concentration was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 126 nondiabetic and 104 type 2 diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The study population was divided according to estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) into the following groups: eGFR &gt;90 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) (n = 53), 60-90 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) (n = 90), 30-60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) (n = 38), and &lt;30 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) (n = 49) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Each group was subdivided into nondiabetic and type 2 diabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: RBP4 serum concentration was elevated (2.65 vs. 2.01 micromol/l; P &lt; 0.001) and eGFR was reduced (56 vs. 74 ml/min per 1.73 m(2); P &lt; 0.001) in type 2 diabetic vs. nondiabetic subjects, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By stratifying for eGFR, no more differences in RBP4 serum concentration were detectable between type 2 diabetic and nondiabetic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A linear regression analysis revealed an influence of eGFR (r = -0.477; P &lt; 0.001) but not A1C (r = 0.093; P = 0.185) on RBP4 serum concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Existing human data showing elevated RBP4 levels in type 2 diabetic patients may be the result of moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal insufficiency</z:hpo> rather than support for the suggestion that RBP4 links <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
