<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Due to its chromosomal location under a chromosome 20 linkage peak and the metabolic effects of its absence in knockout mice, it is a candidate gene for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have associated common sequence variants in PTPN1 with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>-related phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We sought to replicate the association of common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and haplotypes in PTPN1 with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and insulin sensitivity in a large collection of subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We assessed linkage disequilibrium, selected tag SNPs, and typed these markers in 3,347 cases of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 3,347 control subjects as well as 1,189 siblings discordant for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Despite power estimated at &gt;95% to replicate the previously reported associations, no statistically significant evidence of association was observed between PTPN1 SNPs or common haplotypes with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or with diabetic phenotypes </plain></SENT>
