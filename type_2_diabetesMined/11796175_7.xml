<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We performed a randomized crossover open comparative study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of voglibose and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi> in 30 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who were not well controlled with diet therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There was no significant reduction of FBG with either voglibose or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi> at 4 and 8 weeks after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The 1 h postprandial blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (PPBG) level was significantly decreased from 224.9+/-42.8 to 204.1+/-37.6 (P=0.005) and 206.1+/-38.9 mg/dl (P=0.038) after voglibose therapy at 4 and 8 weeks, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Significant decrease was also obtained after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi> treatment from 228.3+/-37.4 to 182.7+/-35.5 (P&lt;0.001) and 186.6+/-36.1 mg/dl (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The decrease of 1 h PPBG was associated with a significant fall of serum insulin concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HbA(1c) levels were also significantly decreased from 7.07+/-1.21 to 6.83+/-1.11 (P=0.017) and 6.79+/-1.33% (P=0.036) after voglibose and 6.98+/-0.98 to 6.70+/-1.04 (P&lt;0.001) and 6.59+/-1.04% (P&lt;0.001) after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi> at 4 and 8 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast to voglibose, treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi> significantly decreased the 2 h PPBG at 4 and 8 weeks and the 2 h postprandial serum insulin concentration at 8 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Adverse drug events were more commonly reported in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi>-treated patients (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Increased flatulence was observed in 56.7 and 90% of the patients taking voglibose and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi>, respectively, while <z:hpo ids='HP_0003270'>abdominal distention</z:hpo> was noted in 10 and 16.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Significantly <z:hpo ids='HP_0004325'>decreased body weights</z:hpo> of 0.9 and 0.8 kg were recorded at 8 weeks after voglibose and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi> therapy, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that both voglibose (0.2 mg) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2376">acarbose</z:chebi> (100 mg) thrice daily significantly decreased HbA(1c), PPBG and postprandial insulin levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At these dose levels, voglibose was associated with less gastrointestinal side effects and slightly less efficacy for postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> reduction </plain></SENT>
