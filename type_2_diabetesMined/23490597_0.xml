<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite aggressive treatment, the number of patients on hemodialysis due to type 1 and type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> is increasing annually </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The lack of reliable animal models that mimic human disease has delayed the identification of specific factors that cause or predict DN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Different investigators around the world are testing different murine models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Validation criteria for early and advanced DN, phenotypic methods, background strain have recently been developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Establishment of an authentic mouse model of DN will undoubtedly facilitate the understanding of the underlying genetic mechanisms that contribute to the development of DN and to study new treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Here we describe the characteristics of our new mouse model with type 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and different haptoglobin genotypes that can mimic human DN </plain></SENT>
