<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical course of individuals with idiopathic type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> after a mean of 5 years from diagnosis and to compare glycemic control between those treated with diet and/or oral agents and those treated with insulin at follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Medical records of patients with new-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, who presented with unprovoked <z:hpo ids='HP_0001953'>diabetic ketoacidosis</z:hpo>, were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 54 of these individuals were traceable and had relevant data collected within the past 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had nonsusceptibility HLA haplotypes and no serological evidence of autoimmune type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most of these patients were male (41 men and 13 women), were non-Caucasian, were <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> at the time of diagnosis (BMI 31.6 +/- 6.3 kg/m(2)), reported <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> (12.8 +/- 9.8 kg), had a family history of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000956'>acanthosis nigricans</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At follow-up, 33 patients were still taking insulin and 21 were on diet and/or oral-agent therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both treatment groups were similar in clinical presentation and demographics at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After 4.8 +/- 1.6 years of follow-up, the 33 patients that were receiving insulin had a lower HbA(1c) than the 21 patients who were using therapies other than insulin (7.8 +/- 2.4 vs. 11.1 +/- 3.5%, P = 0.009; 95% CI 1.0-6.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a high correlation between change in weight and change in HbA(1c) at follow-up (r = 0.45, P &lt; 0.001, n = 54) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in the rate of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> complications or in the episodes of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001953'>diabetic ketoacidosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Idiopathic type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> occurs more frequently in male African-American patients but also occurs in other ethnic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients with idiopathic type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> who continued to use insulin had better glycemic control than patients using therapies other than insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Regained weight is a good clinical marker for improvement in glycemic control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Individuals with this type of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> should not be switched to therapies other than insulin </plain></SENT>
