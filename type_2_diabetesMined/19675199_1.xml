<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Seasonal environment at birth may influence <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> incidence in later life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought evidence for this effect in a large sample of diabetic youth residing in the U.S </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We compared the distribution of birth months within the SEARCH for <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> in Youth Study (SEARCH study) with the monthly distributions in U.S. births tabulated by race for years 1982-2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SEARCH study participants (9,737 youth with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 1,749 with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>) were identified by six collaborating U.S. centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among type 1 diabetic youth, the percentage of observed to expected births differed across the months (P = 0.0092; decreased in October-February and increased in March-July) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Their smoothed birth-month estimates demonstrated a deficit in November-February births and an excess in April-July births (smoothed May versus January relative risk [RR] = 1.06 [95% CI 1.02-1.11]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Stratifications by sex or by three racial groups showed similar patterns relating type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> to month of birth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Stratification by geographic regions showed a peak-to-nadir RR of 1.10 [1.04-1.16] in study regions from the northern latitudes (Colorado, western Washington State, and southern Ohio) but no birth-month effect (P &gt; 0.9) in study regions from more southern locations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among type 2 diabetic youth, associations with birth month were inconclusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Spring births were associated with increased likelihood of type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> but possibly not in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> U.S. regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Causal mechanisms may involve factors dependent on geographic latitude such as solar irradiance, but it is unknown whether they influence prenatal or early postnatal development </plain></SENT>
