<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Phosphorylation of TBC1 domain family, member 4 (TBC1D4) is at present the most distal insulin receptor signalling event linked to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> transport </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined insulin action on site-specific phosphorylation of TBC1D4 and the effect of exercise training on insulin action and signalling to TBC1D4 in skeletal muscle from type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: During a 3 h euglycaemic-hyperinsulinaemic (80 mU min⁻¹ m⁻²) clamp, we obtained M. vastus lateralis biopsies from 13 <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> type 2 diabetic and 13 <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp>, non-diabetic control individuals before and after 10 weeks of endurance exercise-training </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Before training, reductions in insulin-stimulated R (d), together with impaired insulin-stimulated <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthase fractional velocity, Akt Thr³⁰⁸ phosphorylation and phosphorylation of TBC1D4 at Ser³¹⁸, Ser⁵⁸⁸ and Ser⁷⁵¹ were observed in skeletal muscle from diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, exercise-training normalised insulin-induced TBC1D4 phosphorylation in diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This happened independently of increased TBC1D4 protein content, but exercise-training did not normalise Akt phosphorylation in diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In both groups, training-induced improvements in insulin-stimulated R(d) (~20%) were associated with increased muscle protein content of Akt, TBC1D4, α2-<z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi>-activated kinase (AMPK), <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthase, hexokinase II and GLUT4 (20-75%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Impaired insulin-induced site-specific TBC1D4 phosphorylation may contribute to skeletal muscle <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms by which exercise-training improves insulin sensitivity in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> may involve augmented signalling of TBC1D4 and increased skeletal muscle content of key insulin signalling and effector proteins, e.g., Akt, TBC1D4, AMPK, <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthase, GLUT4 and hexokinase II </plain></SENT>
