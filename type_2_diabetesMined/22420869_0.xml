<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) complement physician evaluations of efficacy and tolerability and offer insights into the subjective experience of using modern <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We conducted a systematic search of clinical trials of the GLP-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> liraglutide, exenatide and long-acting exenatide, one of which included the oral DPP-4 inhibitor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40237">sitagliptin</z:chebi> as a comparator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No other PRO data for DPP-4 inhibitors were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This review summarizes PRO data from eight clinical trials, the majority of which used the <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (DTSQ) and/or Impact of Weight on Quality of Life-Lite (IWQOL-Lite) to evaluate patient experience </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>People with T2DM were highly satisfied with modern incretin-based therapies compared with traditional therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treatment satisfaction (including perceptions of convenience and flexibility) was high and generally higher with GLP-1 agonists in association with their greater <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering efficacy and tendency to facilitate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Weight-related quality of life (QoL) also improved in people using incretin therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The glycaemic improvements achieved with GLP-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi>, coupled with the low incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> and ability to cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo>, seemed to offset potential concern about injections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is plausible that superior patient-reported benefits found in clinical trials may translate into improved, clinically meaningful, long-term outcomes through increased treatment acceptability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Long-term, prospective data are needed to ascertain whether this is the case in practice </plain></SENT>
