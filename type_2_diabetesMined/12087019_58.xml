<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 120 consecutive patients, who were free of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (CAD) at entry, were studied for a period of 24 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These patients were randomly assigned to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> (20 mg/day, n = 40), micronized <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5001">fenofibrate</z:chebi> (200 mg/day, n = 40), or a combination of both (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi> 20 mg/day plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5001">fenofibrate</z:chebi> 200 mg/day, n = 40) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effect of treatment on <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> (TGs), <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> A-I and B, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi>(a), and plasma fibrinogen (PF) was recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the percentage of patients that reached the American <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Association treatment goals and the estimated CAD risk status were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No patient was withdrawn from the study because of side effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="5001">fenofibrate</z:chebi> combination reduced total cholesterol by 37%, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> by 46%, TGs by 50%, and PF by 20%, whereas it increased <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> by 22% (P &lt; 0.0001 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These changes were significantly better than those of both monotherapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the patients on drug combination, 97.5% reached the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> treatment goal of &lt;100 mg/dl, 100% reached the desirable TG levels of &lt;200 mg/dl, and 60% reached the optimal <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> levels of &gt;45 mg/dl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These rates were significantly higher than those of both monotherapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Combined treatment reduced the 10-year probability for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> from 21.6 to 4.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39548">atorvastatin</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="5001">fenofibrate</z:chebi> combination has a highly beneficial effect on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> parameters and PF in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and CHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It improved patients' CAD risk status significantly more than each drug alone </plain></SENT>
