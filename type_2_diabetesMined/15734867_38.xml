<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>11HSD1 inhibitors may enhance insulin sensitivity in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and be most efficacious in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> when 11HSD1 is increased in subcutaneous adipose biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined the regeneration of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> in vivo in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, and the effects of the 11HSD1 inhibitor carbenoxolone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We compared six lean and six <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> men and performed a randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study of carbenoxolone in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> men had no difference in their whole-body rate of regenerating <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> (measured with 9,11,12,12-[(2)H(4)]<z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> tracer), but had more rapid conversion of [(3)H]<z:chebi fb="11" ids="16962">cortisone</z:chebi> to [(3)H]<z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> in abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue (measured with microdialysis) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During insulin infusion, adipose 11HSD1 activity fell markedly in lean but not in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Carbenoxolone inhibited whole-body <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> regeneration, but did not significantly inhibit adipose 11HSD1 and had no effects on insulin sensitivity (measured by [(2)H(2)]<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> infusion with or without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, in vivo <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> generation is increased selectively within adipose tissue in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, perhaps reflecting resistance to insulin-mediated downregulation of 11HSD1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> men are less susceptible than lean men to the insulin-sensitizing effects of carbenoxolone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>To be useful in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients, 11HSD1 inhibitors will need to inhibit the enzyme more effectively in adipose tissue </plain></SENT>
