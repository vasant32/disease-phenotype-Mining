<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Considerable data support adiponectin as an important adipose-derived insulin sensitizer that enhances fatty acid oxidation and alters hepatic gluconeogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Adiponectin acts by way of two receptors, ADIPOR1 and ADIPOR2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>ADIPOR1 is widely expressed in tissues, including muscle, liver, and pancreas, and binds the globular form of adiponectin with high affinity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To test the hypothesis that sequence variations in or near the ADIPOR1 gene contribute to the risk of developing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e>, we screened the eight exons (including the untranslated exon 1) of the ADIPOR1 gene with flanking intronic sequences and the 5' and 3' flanking sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We identified 22 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in Caucasian and African-American subjects, of which a single nonsynonymous SNP (N44K) in exon 2 was present only in African-American subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We typed 14 sequence variants that had minor allele frequencies &gt;5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No SNP was associated with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in Caucasians or African Americans, and no SNP was a determinant of insulin sensitivity or insulin secretion among nondiabetic members of high-risk Caucasian families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the two alleles of a SNP in the 3' untranslated region were expressed unequally, and ADIPOR1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels were significantly lower among transformed lymphocytes from diabetic African-American individuals than among control cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This altered gene expression might suggest a role for ADIPOR1 in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
