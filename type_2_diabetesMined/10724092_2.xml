<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We prospectively studied the long term-effect of STTP on metabolic control and knowledge of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, differences in the mode of follow-up by a university <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> centre (UDC) versus general practitioner (GP) were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the 64 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (61 +/- 10 years old, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration 11 +/- 7 years) included in the study 52 could be reevaluated after 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of those, 31 were followed up by the UDC and 21 by their GPs who received detailed follow-up instructions from the UDC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, HbA1c decreased from 9.1 +/- 0.3% before the programme to 8.3 +/- 0.3% 2 years after the programme (P = 0.004), whereas body mass index increased from 28.8 +/- 0.8 to 30.3 +/- 0.9 kg/m2 (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients had a significantly better knowledge of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and diet 2 years after the programme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> parameters tested, none of the changes differed between patients managed by the UDC versus those managed by their GP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, patients who chose follow-up by the UDC were more <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> and had a better knowledge of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the STTP for patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was effective in improving the long-term glycaemic control and knowledge of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Moreover, with precise therapeutic goals and follow-up instructions given to patient and GP this improvement was independent of the mode of outpatient follow-up </plain></SENT>
