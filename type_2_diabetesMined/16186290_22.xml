<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine whether overweight Latino children with impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (IFG) (&gt; or = 100 mg/dl) have increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> or decreased beta-cell function compared with those with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (NFG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied 207 healthy overweight Latino children, aged 8-13 years, with a family history of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fasting and 2-h <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin were assessed by oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Insulin sensitivity (S(i)), the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> insulin response to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (AIRg), and the disposition index (DI; an index of beta-cell function) were determined using the insulin-modified intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test and minimal modeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Body composition was determined by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no differences in body composition between NFG (n = 182) and IFG (n = 25) children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with children with NFG, children with IFG had higher fasting and 2-h <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> values and higher fasting insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for covariates, children with IFG had no difference in S(i) but 15% lower DI than NFG children (2,224 +/- 210 vs. 2,613 +/- 76, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariate linear regression showed that AIRg and DI, but not S(i), were significant predictors of fasting blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In overweight Latino adolescents with a family history of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, IFG is associated with impaired beta-cell function and therefore may identify children likely to be at risk for progression to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The actual risk of progression of IFG to type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> remains to be determined by prospective longitudinal studies </plain></SENT>
