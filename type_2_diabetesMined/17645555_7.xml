<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To quantify adverse events (AEs) associated with the use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> (MET), sulphonylureas (SUs) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">thiazolidinediones</z:chebi> (TZDs) in a usual care setting, and to assess the relationship of AEs to treatment patterns and glycaemic response in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN and METHODS: An electronic medical record database was used to identify patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> age &gt;or=18 years from 1996 to 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients na√Øve to oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> therapy were followed for 395 days postinitiation of MET, SU or TZD treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AEs related to study drugs were evaluated during the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Baseline and follow-up A1C levels were compared by drug regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Associations between the change in A1C, drug regimen changes and AEs were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 14,512 patients (mean age 60.8 years, 52.9% female) were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During the follow-up period, 12.7% of patients experienced an AE (8.6% MET, 15.9% SU and 19.8% TZD patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>SU and TZD patients were more likely to experience an AE than MET (p &lt; 0.001) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>AEs did not significantly influence A1C outcomes, although MET and SU patients experiencing an AE were more likely to add-on therapy (odds ratio (OR) = 1.34 and OR = 1.37, respectively; p &lt; 0.05) than those without an AE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>MET patients with AEs were more likely to switch therapy (OR = 1.91; p &lt; 0.05) than those without an AE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The occurrence of AEs did not significantly impact glycaemic response to therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, AEs may lead to greater treatment switches for patients receiving MET and add-on therapy for MET-treated and SU-treated patients </plain></SENT>
