<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a population-based nested case-control study using the administrative databases of Saskatchewan Health to assess the study objective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We identified cases of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> based on diagnostics codes and prescription records for individuals over the age of 20 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For each case subject, two control subjects were randomly selected from the nondiabetic population during the same index year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>History of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, based on diagnostic codes and antidepressant prescription, was ascertained up to 3 years before index date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Simple and multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% CIs, after adjusting for age, sex, and frequency of physician visits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Individuals with newly diagnosed <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (1,622 of 33,257; 4.9%) were 30% more likely to have had a previous history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> compared with people without <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (2,279 of 59,420; 3.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This increased risk remained after controlling for sex and number of physician visits but was limited to subjects 20-50 years of age (adjusted OR 1.23 [95% CI 1.10-1.37]) and not in those aged &gt; or =51 years (0.92 [0.84-1.00]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> appears to increase the risk of developing <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> by approximately 23% in younger adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This provides information regarding the temporality of the relationship between <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
