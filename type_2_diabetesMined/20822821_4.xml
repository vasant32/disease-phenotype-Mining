<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We identified 48 trials, with 85 arms and 30,588 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were 38 arms using basal insulin, with 17,588 patients, and a primary outcome of 41.4% (95% CI=35.6-47.4%); 26 arms using biphasic insulin, with 9237 patients, and a primary outcome of 46.5% (40.8-52.3%); 9 arms using prandial insulin, with 1605 patients, and a primary outcome of 39.6% (95% CI, 28.6-51.3%); and 12 arms using basal-bolus insulin, with 2114 patients, and a primary outcome of 53.9% (43.5-64) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The high <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> was related, in part, to first time insulin use, final insulin dose, and use of oral drug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The overall incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> ranged from 0 to 4.71 events/patient/30 days; <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> ranged from 1.75 kg for basal to 3 kg for biphasic insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The HbA1c target of &lt;7% can be achieved in a percentage of type 2 diabetic patients ranging from 40% to 54% depending on the particular insulin regimen </plain></SENT>
