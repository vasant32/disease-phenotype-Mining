<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine the associations between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> use and levels of insulin and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> as well as the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> use on the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This report is based on 857 women who were both nondiabetic and postmenopausal at the baseline examination (1989-1992) and who completed a second examination (1993-1995) an average of 4 years later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The participants were divided into three groups: never, past, and current users based on their baseline <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> use status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ANCOVA was used to compare the insulin and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels among <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> use groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression was used to evaluate the association between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> use and the incidence of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Postmenopausal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> use was associated with lower fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (0.2 mmol/l lower) but higher 2-h <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels (0.4 mmol/l higher) compared with never users </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It was not significantly associated with the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> compared with past and never users, based on American <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Association or World Health Organization definitions of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or on only a 2-h <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level &gt; or = 11.1 mmol/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> increased with increasing duration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> use among current users, with an odds ratio of 1.10 per year of use (95% CI: 1.01-1.19) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> use in American Indian postmenopausal women may relate to deterioration of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Longer duration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> use among current users may relate to an increased risk of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
