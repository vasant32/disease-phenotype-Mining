<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Phobic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> has been associated with increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>), but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to determine whether associations of phobic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> with several known markers of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> might be contributors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We used a 16-point validated index (Crown-Crisp) measured in 1988 to categorize 984 women with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> from the Nurses' Health Study as having low, moderate, or high phobic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Groups were then compared for differences in adipokines (adiponectin and leptin), inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor [TNF]-alpha receptor II), and markers of endothelial function (sE-selectin, soluble intercellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule [sICAM]-1) measured on blood samples provided between 1989 and 1990 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Higher levels of phobic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> were associated with higher BMI and lower education </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Higher levels of phobic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> were also associated with higher leptin and soluble TNF-alpha receptor II in both crude analyses and after adjustment for potential confounders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>sICAM and sE-selectin were higher in the highest tertile compared with the middle tertile, but there was no significant trend across tertiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We found no association between phobic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> and adiponectin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: High levels of phobic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> are associated with increased levels of leptin and inflammatory markers, which may in part explain the previously observed relationship between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> and other psychosocial disorders with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
