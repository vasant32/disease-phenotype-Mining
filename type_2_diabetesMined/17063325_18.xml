<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previously we have shown that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001518'>low birthweight</z:hpo> is associated with changes in muscle insulin signalling proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we determined whether <z:hpo ids='HP_0001518'>low birthweight</z:hpo> is associated with changes in insulin signalling proteins in adipose tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Men (age 23 years) with either a low (bottom 10th percentile) (n = 17) or a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (50th-90th percentile) (n = 17) birthweight were recruited from the Danish Medical Birth Registry and subcutaneous adipose biopsies were taken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Between the two groups there was no difference in protein level of the insulin receptor, protein kinase C zeta, <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthase kinase-3 (GSK3) alpha, GSK3 beta, protein kinase B alpha and beta, peroxisome proliferative activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 or Src-homology-2-containing protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the levels of GLUT4 (also known as solute carrier family 2 [facilitated <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> transporter], member 4 [SLC2A4]) (52 +/- 10.9% reduction, p &lt; 0.01), p85alpha subunit of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16749">phosphoinositide</z:chebi> 3-kinase (PI3K) (45 +/- 9% reduction, p &lt; 0.01), p110ss subunit of PI3K (48 +/- 17% reduction, p = 0.06) and IRS1 (59 +/- 24% reduction, p &lt; 0.05) were reduced in men of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001518'>low birthweight</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: These findings show that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001518'>low birthweight</z:hpo> is associated with reduced levels of adipose insulin signalling proteins, thus providing a potential molecular framework to explain why people with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001518'>low birthweight</z:hpo> are at increased risk of developing type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These differences precede the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and thus may help predict disease risk </plain></SENT>
