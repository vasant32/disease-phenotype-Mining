<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have reported higher prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> among mothers of probands with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> than among fathers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This analysis is vulnerable to biases, and this pattern has not been observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> populations or races </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We assessed evidence for excess maternal transmission among 42,533 survey respondents with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (probands) by calculating the prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in their siblings and offspring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To assess data quality, we evaluated completeness of family history data provided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Accuracy of family information reported by probands was also evaluated by comparing survey responses in a subsample of 206 probands with family histories modified after further interviews with relatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Siblings (n = 60,532) of probands with affected mothers had a greater prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (20%) than those with affected fathers (17%) (P &lt; 0.001 for adjusted odds ratios) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Prevalence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was higher among the offspring (n = 72,087) of female (3.4%) versus male (2.2%) probands (P &lt; 0.001 for adjusted odds ratios) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These patterns were evident in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> races and both sexes; however, the effect size was clinically insignificant in African-Americans and male offspring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In general, probands provided more complete data about <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> status for the maternal arm of the pedigree than the paternal arm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Completeness of knowledge was not related to proband sex, but was related to education and race, and inversely to age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Accuracy of proband-reported family history was consistently good (kappa statistics generally &gt; 0.70) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Excess maternal transmission was observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> races and both sexes, although the size of the excess was negligible in African-Americans and male offspring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Potential reporting and censoring biases are discussed </plain></SENT>
