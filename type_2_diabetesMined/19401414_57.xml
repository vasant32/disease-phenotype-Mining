<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To identify novel type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> gene variants and confirm previously identified ones, a three-staged genome-wide association study was performed in the Japanese population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In the stage 1 scan, we genotyped 519 case and 503 control subjects with 482,625 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers; in the stage 2 panel comprising 1,110 case subjects and 1,014 control subjects, we assessed 1,456 SNPs (P &lt; 0.0025, stage 1); additionally to direct genotyping, 964 healthy control subjects formed the in silico control panel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Along with genome-wide exploration, we aimed to replicate the disease association of 17 SNPs from 16 candidate loci previously identified in Europeans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The associated and/or replicated loci (23 SNPs; P &lt; 7 x 10(-5) for genome-wide exploration and P &lt; 0.05 for replication) were examined in the stage 3 panel comprising 4,000 case subjects and 12,569 population-based samples, from which 4,889 nondiabetic control subjects were preselected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 12,569 subjects were used for overall risk assessment in the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Four loci-1 novel with suggestive evidence (PEPD on 19q13, P = 1.4 x 10(-5)) and three previously reported-were identified; the association of CDKAL1, CDKN2A/CDKN2B, and KCNQ1 were confirmed (P &lt; 10(-19)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, significant associations were replicated in five other candidate loci: TCF7L2, IGF2BP2, SLC30A8, HHEX, and KCNJ11 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was substantial overlap of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> susceptibility genes between the two populations, whereas effect size and explained variance tended to be higher in the Japanese population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The strength of association was more prominent in the Japanese population than in Europeans for more than half of the confirmed type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> loci </plain></SENT>
