<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 429 Japanese subjects with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and with normoalbuminuria (n = 299) or with <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> (n = 130) were enrolled in a prospective observational follow-up study during 1995-1998 and followed until 2001 (for at least 3 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The endpoint was the occurrence of a renal event defined as the progression to a higher stage of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the study (the mean follow-up period: 4.4 +/- 1.0 years), 31 of 429 subjects progressed: 21 from normoalbuminuria to <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> and 10 from <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> to overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The allele frequency of the APOE polymorphism was significantly different between the progressors and the nonprogressors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eight of 42 epsilon2 carriers (19%) progressed, whereas 23 of 387 noncarriers (6%) progressed with a relative risk of 3.2 (95% CI 1.5-6.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When subjects were stratified by renal status at baseline, each relative risk for the progression in the epsilon2 carriers was 2.7 (0.99-7.4) in those with normoalbuminuria and 4.2 (1.3-13.3) in those with <z:mp ids='MP_0002959'>microalbuminuria</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, when analyzed only in subjects with normoalbuminuria and short duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (&lt;15 years) at baseline, the risk in the epsilon2 carriers became higher to 3.2 (1.2-8.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our follow-up study indicates that the epsilon2 allele of the APOE polymorphism is a prognostic risk factor for both the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and the progression of diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> in Japanese type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
