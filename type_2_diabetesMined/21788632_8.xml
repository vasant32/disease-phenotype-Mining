<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To test whether adding mobile application coaching and patient/provider web portals to community primary care compared with standard <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> management would reduce glycated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> levels in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A cluster-randomized clinical trial, the Mobile <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Intervention Study, randomly assigned 26 primary care practices to one of three stepped treatment groups or a control group (usual care) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 163 patients were enrolled and included in analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome was change in glycated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> levels over a 1-year treatment period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Secondary outcomes were changes in patient-reported <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> symptoms, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> distress, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, and other clinical (blood pressure) and laboratory (<z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>) values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Maximal treatment was a mobile- and web-based self-management patient coaching system and provider decision support </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients received automated, real-time educational and behavioral messaging in response to individually analyzed blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> values, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> medications, and lifestyle behaviors communicated by mobile phone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Providers received quarterly reports summarizing patient's glycemic control, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> medication management, lifestyle behaviors, and evidence-based treatment options </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean declines in glycated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> were 1.9% in the maximal treatment group and 0.7% in the usual care group, a difference of 1.2% (P &lt; 0.001) over 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Appreciable differences were not observed between groups for patient-reported <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> distress, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> symptoms, or blood pressure and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> levels (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The combination of behavioral mobile coaching with blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> data, lifestyle behaviors, and patient self-management data individually analyzed and presented with evidence-based guidelines to providers substantially reduced glycated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> levels over 1 year </plain></SENT>
