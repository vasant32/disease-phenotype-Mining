<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">Troglitazone</z:chebi> exerts an antihyperglycemic activity in a dose-dependent manner between 200 and 600 mg/day in type 2 diabetic patients treated with diet alone, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylureas</z:chebi>, or insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Additive antihyperglycemic effect may also be obtained by combining <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The antihyperglycemic effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> as monotherapy is rather modest (reduction of HbA1c by 0.5-1.0%), but it appears to be somewhat greater when it is combined with other <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No double-blind studies have directly compared the activity of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> with that of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylureas</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">Troglitazone</z:chebi> has been shown to exert additional beneficial effects on serum <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile and arterial blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It may be considered as a valuable alternative in insulin-resistant (<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> and hyperinsulinemic) diabetic patients who appear to be the best responders to the drug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the efficacy of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> is challenged by its safety profile, and the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0235378,C0348754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Injury or Poisoning" abbrv="">hepatotoxicity</z:e> still remains a major concern in clinical practice </plain></SENT>
