<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whereas RBP4 is also mainly expressed in hepatocytes as the principal transport protein for <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50211">retinol</z:chebi> (vitamin A) in the circulation, and its pathophysiological role in liver remain unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this paper was to investigate the association between RBP4 and nonalcoholic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>fatty liver</z:hpo> disease (NAFLD) in patients with type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum RBP4 and adiponectin concentrations were measured by radioimmunoassay in 52 diabetic patients who had NAFLD and 50 sex- and age-matched diabetic patients without any clinical features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver diseases</z:e> who had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> liver ultrasonic appearance and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> liver function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum RBP4 levels were elevated in diabetic patients with NAFLD (32.0+/-8.9 microg/ml vs. 41.3+/-9.8 microg/ml, p&lt;0.001), while adiponectin decreased (17.4+/-9.3 microg/ml vs. 13.8+/-7.0 microg/ml, p=0.032) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Male diabetic patients had higher serum RBP4 concentration and lower serum adiponectin concentration than female diabetic patients (38.5+/-9.9 microg/ml vs. 34.0+/-10.7 microg/ml, p=0.031 and 12.7+/-5.7 microg/ml vs. 20.23+/-9.8 microg/ml, p&lt;0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed RBP4 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> as independent association factors for NAFLD, while the association between serum adiponectin and NAFLD was not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Increasing concentrations of RBP4 were independently and significantly associated with NAFLD in diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In multiple linear regression analysis, alanine aminotransferase, fasting serum insulin and adiponectin were independent factors for serum RBP4 level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The study demonstrates that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50211">retinol</z:chebi> binding protein 4 might contribute to the pathogenesis of nonalcoholic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>fatty liver</z:hpo> disease </plain></SENT>
