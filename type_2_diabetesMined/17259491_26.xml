<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to develop valid algorithms for estimation of the insulin sensitivity index (S(I)) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> insulin response (AIR) derived from simple and cheap physiological measurements that could be used in large-scale metabolic, genetic, and epidemiological studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: For our purpose, data from an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (OGTT) (18 samples during 240 min) and a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27999">tolbutamide</z:chebi>-modified intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (IVGTT) (33 samples during 180 min) from 258 individuals with fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> &lt;7 mmol/l and 2-h plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> &lt;7.8 mmol/l were used for model development and internal validation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data from an additional 28 individuals were used for external validation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Bergman's minimal model was used to calculate S(I), and the trapezoidal method was used to calculate AIR(0-8 min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multiple linear regression was applied to derive predictive equations of log(S(I)) and log(AIR(0-8 min)) using data on sex, BMI, plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and serum insulin levels obtained during the OGTT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We demonstrate that it is possible to obtain estimates of S(I) (BIGTT-S(I)) and AIR (BIGTT-AIR) that are highly correlated to IVGTT-derived values of S(I) (R(2) = 0.77) and AIR (R(2) = 0.54) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the two validation datasets we obtained similar results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Data from OGTTs can provide accurate measures of insulin sensitivity and beta-cell function, which can be used in large scale metabolic, genetic, and epidemiological studies </plain></SENT>
