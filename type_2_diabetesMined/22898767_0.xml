<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Effects of the racemate and its pure enantiomers on isolated pancreatic islets and beta cells in vitro, as well as on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> in vivo, were investigated in a comparative manner in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In isolated perifused islets, the two enantiomers of efaroxan were equally potent in counteracting inhibition of insulin release by the ATP-dependent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> (K(ATP)) channel-opener <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4495">diazoxide</z:chebi> but (+)-efaroxan, the presumptive carrier of α(2)-antagonistic activity, was by far superior in counteracting inhibition of insulin release by the α(2)-<z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> UK14,304 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In vivo, (+)-efaroxan improved oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance at 100-fold lower doses than (-)-efaroxan and, in parallel with observations made in vitro, was more effective in counteracting UK14,304-induced than <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4495">diazoxide</z:chebi>-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The antihyperglycaemic activity of much higher doses of (-)-efaroxan was associated with an opposing pattern (i.e. with stronger counteraction of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4495">diazoxide</z:chebi>-induced than UK14,304-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hyperglycaemia</z:e>), which implicates a different mechanism of action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The antihyperglycaemic potency of (±)-efaroxan in mice is almost entirely due to α(2)-antagonism, but high doses can also lower blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> via another mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our findings call for reappraisal of the possible clinical utility of α(2A)-antagonistic compounds in recently identified subpopulations of patients in which a congenitally higher level of α(2A)-adrenergic activation contributes to the development and pathophysiology of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
