<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested whether <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> amelioration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> would preserve pancreatic beta-cell function and delay or prevent the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in high-risk Hispanic women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Women with previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0009800'>gestational diabetes</z:hpo> were randomized to placebo (n = 133) or the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">insulin-sensitizing drug</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> (400 mg/day; n = 133) administered in double-blind fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was measured every 3 months, and oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance tests (OGTTs) were performed annually to detect <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance tests (IVGTTs) were performed at baseline and 3 months later to identify early metabolic changes associated with any protection from <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Women who did not develop <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> during the trial returned for OGTTs and IVGTTs 8 months after study medications were stopped </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During a median follow-up of 30 months on blinded medication, average annual <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> incidence rates in the 236 women who returned for at least one follow-up visit were 12.1 and 5.4% in women assigned to placebo and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi>, respectively (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Protection from <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> group 1) was closely related to the degree of reduction in endogenous insulin requirements 3 months after randomization, 2) persisted 8 months after study medications were stopped, and 3) was associated with preservation of beta-cell compensation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9753">troglitazone</z:chebi> delayed or prevented the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in high-risk Hispanic women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The protective effect was associated with the preservation of pancreatic beta-cell function and appeared to be mediated by a reduction in the secretory demands placed on beta-cells by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
