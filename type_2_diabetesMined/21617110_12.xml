<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded end point trial on 448 hypertensive patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, 255 men/193 women, mean ± SD age 62.5 ± 10.8 years, randomized to ingest <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> their prescribed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> medications upon awakening or ≥1 of them at bedtime </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ambulatory blood pressure was measured for 48 h at baseline and again annually or even more frequently (quarterly) after adjustments in treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 5.4 years, patients ingesting ≥1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> medications at bedtime showed a significantly lower cardiovascular risk (adjusted by age and sex) than subjects ingesting <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> medications upon awakening (hazard ratio 0.33 [95% CI 0.21-0.54]; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The difference between groups in the adjusted risk of major events (cardiovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>) was also statistically significant (0.25 [0.10-0.61]; P = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients treated at bedtime showed significantly lower sleep time blood pressure mean and higher prevalence of controlled ambulatory blood pressure (62.5 vs. 50.9%; P = 0.013) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a significant 12% cardiovascular risk reduction per each 5 mmHg decrease in asleep systolic blood pressure during follow-up (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, treatment with ≥1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> medications at bedtime, compared with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> medications upon waking, resulted in improved ambulatory blood pressure control and significantly reduced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1301700" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular morbidity</z:e> and mortality </plain></SENT>
