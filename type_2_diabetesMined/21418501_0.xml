<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: The presence of functional gastric inhibitory <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> (GIP) receptors on adipocytes and knowledge that GIP plays a key role in fat deposition suggests a beneficial effect of GIP receptor antagonism in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>GIP receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> studied to date are peptidic GIP analogues that must be administered by injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The present study has examined in vitro and in vivo metabolic actions of a low molecular weight GIP receptor modulator <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30763">4-hydroxybenzoic acid</z:chebi> 2-bromobenzylidene <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35362">hydrazide</z:chebi> (4H2BH), suitable for oral administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 4H2BH alone had no significant effect on cAMP production or insulin secretion from BRIN-BD11 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, 4H2BH significantly inhibited GIP-mediated cAMP production and insulin secretion in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>4H2BH also suppressed (p &lt; 0.05 to p &lt; 0.001) glucagon-induced elevations of cAMP generation and insulin secretion in BRIN-BD11 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, 4H2BH had no effect on glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 (GLP-1) mediated insulinotropic actions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Administration of 4H2BH to mice in combination with <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and GIP significantly annulled the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering actions of GIP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In agreement with this, 4H2BH completely annulled GIP-mediated insulin secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Combined injection of 4H2BH with glucagon also partially (p &lt; 0.05 to p &lt; 0.001) impaired glucagon-induced elevations in blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and plasma insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>4H2BH had no effect on blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> or insulin levels when administered alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results indicate that 4H2BH has a dual effect of inhibiting GIP and glucagon-mediated biological actions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Given that hyperglucagonaemia is also a cardinal feature of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, 4H2BH and related low molecular weight compounds appear worthy of further evaluation for therapeutic potential in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
