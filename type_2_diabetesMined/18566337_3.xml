<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between iron status, hereditary <z:mp ids='MP_0005638'>hemochromatosis</z:mp> (HFE) gene mutations, and clinical features and outcomes of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in a well-characterized representative sample of community-based patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: HFE genotype data were available for 1,245 type 2 diabetic patients from the longitudinal observational Fremantle <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Study (FDS), representing 96.2% of the total FDS type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data were collected at recruitment between 1993 and 1996 and annually until the end of June 2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hospitalization and mortality data were available until the end of June 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The presence of the C282Y HFE mutation was determined in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects and H63D in C282Y heterozygotes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fasting serum iron, transferrin, and ferritin were measured in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> C282Y homozygotes and C282Y/H63D heterozygotes and in 286 randomly selected <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to determine independent baseline associates of prevalent complications (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, cerebrovascular disease, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo>), as was Cox proportional hazards modeling to determine predictors of incident complications and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Although there were expected positive associations between HFE gene mutations and serum iron and transferrin saturation, there were no independent positive associations between HFE gene status and either microvascular or macrovascular complications in cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>HFE gene status did not independently predict cardiac or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Measures of iron metabolism including serum ferritin were not associated with combined microvascular or macrovascular end points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Directed screening for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e> and/or HFE mutations appears unwarranted in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
