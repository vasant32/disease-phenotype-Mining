<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: This phase 3, 26-week, open-label, treat-to-target trial investigated the efficacy and safety of insulin degludec/insulin aspart (IDegAsp) in insulin-naïve Japanese adults with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Subjects were randomized to once-daily injections of IDegAsp (n = 147) or insulin glargine (IGlar) (n = 149), both ±≤2 oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>IDegAsp was given before the largest meal at the discretion of each subject (and maintained throughout the trial); IGlar was dosed according to label </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both insulins were titrated to a target prebreakfast self-measured plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> of 3.9 to &lt;5.0 mmol/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After 26 weeks, mean HbA1c was 7% with IDegAsp and 7.3% with IGlar; superiority of IDegAsp to IGlar was shown (estimated treatment difference, ETD; IDegAsp-IGlar: -0.28% points [-0.46; -0.10]95% CI , p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At end-of-trial, mean fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (FPG) was similar for IDegAsp and IGlar (5.7 vs. 5.6 mmol/l; ETD IDegAsp-IGlar: 0.15 mmol/l [-0.29; 0.60]95% CI , p = NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>IDegAsp was associated with numerically lower rates of overall confirmed (27%) and nocturnal confirmed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> (25%) versus IGlar (estimated rate ratio IDegAsp/IGlar: 0.73 [0.50; 1.08]95% CI , p = NS, and 0.75 [0.34; 1.64]95% CI , p = NS, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean daily insulin doses were similar between groups at end-of-trial (both: 0.41 U/kg) as were the increases in body weight from baseline (both: 0.7 kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Adverse event profiles were similar between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: IDegAsp provided superior long-term glycaemic control compared to IGlar, with similar FPG and doses and numerically lower rates of overall and nocturnal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020615" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglycaemia</z:e> (p = NS) </plain></SENT>
