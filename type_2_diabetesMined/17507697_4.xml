<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Data from 2,160 randomly selected patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> were extracted from the manual medical records of a nationwide sample of 48 randomly selected health centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Physician and organizational characteristics were collected from national reports, questionnaires, interviews, and observation at the centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were undertaken to identify associations with four quality-of-care scores, based on processes and intermediate outcomes of care and 53 potential explanatory factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean age of the study population was 62.4 years, mean duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was 8.4 years, 62% were female, and 94% had type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the final multivariate models, factors independently and significantly associated with higher process-of-care scores were regional affluence, doctor motivation, and the use of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> disease clinics (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Health centers with younger patients and increased availability of medication were independently and significantly associated with improved outcome-of-care scores (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The final models of the four quality-of-care scores explained 55-71% of the variations in scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Use of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> disease clinics, availability of medication, and possibly doctor motivation appear to be the most strongly related modifiable factors influencing <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings will be used to develop and implement culturally appropriate quality improvement interventions to improve the quality of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We recommend our findings be taken into account in other low-/middle-income countries </plain></SENT>
