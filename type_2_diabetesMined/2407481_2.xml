<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and free insulin levels were similar in both groups, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance was markedly worse in the undernourished subjects, with a mean incremental <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> area (+/- SE) of 22.8 +/- 2.3 mmol/l.h vs. 12.4 +/- 1.3 in the <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> diabetic subjects (P less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The incremental insulin response (area under the curve) to oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> in the undernourished group (39.3 +/- 7.9 mU/l.h) was 50% lower than the response in both the <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> group (89.2 +/- 19.9, P less than 0.001) and a group of non-diabetic, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> weight-for-height subjects (77.1 +/- 5.7, P less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Peak insulin levels were similarly reduced to approximately half the levels seen in the <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> and control groups (P less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Undernutrition is known to impair both <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance and insulin secretory reserve by reducing the beta cell number, size, and granulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> undernutrition accentuates <z:hpo ids='HP_0006279'>beta cell dysfunction</z:hpo> in undernourished diabetics, leading to increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
