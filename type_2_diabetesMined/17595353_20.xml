<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Successful maintenance of glycemic control was predefined as an A1C increase of &lt; 0.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 49 patients (aged 53 +/- 8 years, with BMI 34 +/- 4 kg/m2, A1C 8.1 +/- 1.1%, and duration of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> 11 +/- 7 years) were randomized to either substitute exenatide for insulin or remain on their current insulin regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients who either completed &gt; or = 8 weeks of study or discontinued because of loss of glycemic control were included in primary efficacy analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 62% (18 of 29) of the exenatide-treated patients maintained glycemic control compared with 81% (13 of 16) of the insulin-treated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the 11 exenatide-treated patients who did not maintain control, 5 discontinued before week 16 because of loss of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The overall safety profile was generally consistent with previous exenatide trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean overall <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> rates were 1.72 and 0.97 events/patient-year for the exenatide and insulin reference groups, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study suggests that it is feasible to sustain glycemic control when substituting exenatide for insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although it is not possible to characterize clear predictors of outcome given the size and exploratory nature of the study, the data suggest that patients with longer disease duration, who are taking higher doses of insulin and have less endogenous beta-cell function, may experience deterioration in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> control if exenatide is substituted for insulin therapy </plain></SENT>
