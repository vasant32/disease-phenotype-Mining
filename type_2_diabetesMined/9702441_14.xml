<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of combining electrotherapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2666">amitriptyline</z:chebi> for the management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> painful <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Patients (n = 26) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2666">amitriptyline</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After 4 weeks, those patients (n = 23) who failed to respond to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2666">amitriptyline</z:chebi> or who only had partial relief were randomized between a sham treatment group (control) or an electrotherapy group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transcutaneous electrotherapy was given for 12 weeks by a portable unit (H-wave machine) that generated a biphasic exponentially decaying waveform (pulse width 4 ms, 25-35 V, &gt; or = 2 Hz) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The degree of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112117" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pain and discomfort</z:e> was graded on a scale of 0-5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An analog scale was used to record the overall change in symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2666">Amitriptyline</z:chebi> produced some degree of symptomatic relief in 15 (60%) of the 26 patients by the 4th week; pain scores decreased from 3.8 +/- 0.1 to 2.9 +/- 0.2 (P &lt; 0.1) and the overall reduction in pain was 26 +/- 5% on an analog scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2666">amitriptyline</z:chebi> plus sham treatment group (n = 9), pain scores declined from 2.8 +/- 0.3 to 1.9 +/- 0.5 (P &lt; 0.03) and the overall reduction in pain was 55 +/- 12%, suggesting a procedure-related placebo effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the group receiving combined electrotherapy and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2666">amitriptyline</z:chebi> (n = 14), symptomatic improvement occurred in 12 (85%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Five (36%) of the patients in this group became asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Pain scores declined from 3.2 +/- 0.2 to 1.4 +/- 0.4 (P &lt; 0.01) and the overall reduction in pain was 66 +/- 10% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The degree of reduction in pain scores and the incremental relief (above the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2666">amitriptyline</z:chebi> effect) were significantly greater (P &lt; 0.03) with electrotherapy as compared with sham treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The outcomes indicate a substantial beneficial effect of electrotherapy over and above any placebo influence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our clinical observations suggest that transcutaneous electrotherapy is effective in reducing the pain associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This form of therapy may be a useful adjunctive modality when it is combined with a pharmacological agent, such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2666">amitriptyline</z:chebi>, to augment symptomatic relief </plain></SENT>
