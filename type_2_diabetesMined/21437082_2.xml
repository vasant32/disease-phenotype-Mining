<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Saxagliptin is a novel dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (DPP-4 inhibitor) for the treatment of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, with a duration profile for once daily dosing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is highly selective for DPP-4 in comparison to other enzymes of the dipeptidyl peptidase family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DPP-4 inhibitors elevate plasma concentrations of the incretin hormones glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 (GLP-1) and gastric inhibitory <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> (GIP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This effect results in a <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-dependent stimulation of insulin secretion and an inhibition of glucagon secretion without an intrinsic risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In comparison to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylureas</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50864">thiazolidinediones</z:chebi> that promote <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp>, DPP-4 inhibitors are weight neutral </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Saxagliptin has been approved by the FDA for the US and by the EMEA for Europe in 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical trials showed a dose-dependent inhibition of DPP-4 by saxagliptin in doses ranging from 2.5 to 100 mg daily without serious side effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Type 2 diabetic patients receiving 5 mg to 10 mg saxagliptin once daily had a significant lowering of HbA(1c) and glycemic parameters along with good tolerability and safety </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Saxagliptin has demonstrated a good efficacy for glycemic parameters in various patient populations either in monotherapy or in combination with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> and other oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35526">antidiabetic</z:chebi> drugs as well as a favorable cardiovascular profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>With its high selectivity for DPP-4 and its clinical and cardiovascular profile, saxagliptin is an attractive novel DPP-4 inhibitor </plain></SENT>
