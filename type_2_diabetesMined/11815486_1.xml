<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, simple methods (such as the various indexes relating fasting insulin to fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>), the increase in plasma insulin at the 30th minute of an oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test, and the increase in insulin or C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> after stimulation by glucagon are relatively reliable compared with more sophisticated approaches to assess beta-cell sensitivity to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, kinetics of insulin secretion, residual insulin secretion, or insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>But these measures are of no decisive help in distinguishing between the various forms of impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> or <z:mp ids='MP_0002057'>non-insulin-dependent diabetes</z:mp>, such as type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, slow type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, the various forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004904'>maturity-onset diabetes of the young</z:hpo>, or the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> genome defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No data are available to show that the measurement of plasma insulin may be of help to adapt the treatment of a diabetic patient, except for the need of insulin therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There are some suggestions that fasting plasma insulin and, more precisely, the homeostasis model assessment indexes may help to predict the progression toward <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or the progressive deterioration of beta-cell function in diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
