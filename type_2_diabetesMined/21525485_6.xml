<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, the heart and arteries are surrounded by layers of adipose tissue, exerting vasocrine and paracrine control of the subtending tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The rapid development of the field of noninvasive imaging has made it possible to quantify ectopic fat masses and contents with an increasing degree of accuracy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Myocardial <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> stores are increased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo>, and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The role of intramyocardial <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> accumulation in the pathogenesis of left ventricular (LV) dysfunction remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Increased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> content is associated with states of fatty acid overload to the heart, saturating the oxidative capacity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It may initially serve as a fatty acid sink to circumscribe the formation of toxic <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> species and subsequently foster cardiac damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Epicardial and perivascular fat depots may exert a protective modulation of vascular function and energy partition in a healthy situation, but their expansion turns them into an adverse lipotoxic, prothrombotic, and proinflammatory organ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>They are augmented in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025517" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic disorders</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (CAD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, the progressive association between the quantity of fat and disease severity in terms of extent of plaque calcification or noncalcified areas, markers of plaque vulnerability, and number of vessels involved is less confirmed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Functional or hybrid imaging may contribute to a better definition of disease severity and unveil the direct myocardial and vascular targets of adipose tissue action </plain></SENT>
