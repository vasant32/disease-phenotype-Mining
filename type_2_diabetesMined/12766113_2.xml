<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, blood pressure is difficult to treat; multiple drug combination therapy is required and treatment algorithms to establish this are lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used a stepped-care algorithm, centered on maximum doses of an <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35457">ACE inhibitor</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> receptor blocker, to treat <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> according to American <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> Association recommended blood pressure target goals (&lt;130/80 mmHg) in patients with diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We treated 49 consecutive patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (13 with type 1 and 36 with type 2), diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> &gt; or =500 mg/24 h with a stepped-care blood pressure treatment algorithm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The level of blood pressure control achieved at most recent follow-up was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients were followed for a median of 18 months (range 9-48) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean blood pressure achieved was 140/75 +/- 23/14 mmHg in patients with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 146/76 +/- 22/14 mmHg in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Target blood pressure was reached in 16 (33%) patients, 6 of 13 patients with type 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and 10 of 36 patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, whereas systolic blood pressure remained above the target level in the remaining patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in baseline blood pressure, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo>, or serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> level between patients who were treated to target and those who were not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Levels of blood pressure control similar to those achieved in clinical trials in diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> were obtained with a stepped-care algorithm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, in most patients, systolic blood pressure was difficult to control to target despite the use of multiple drug combination therapy </plain></SENT>
