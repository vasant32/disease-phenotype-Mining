<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Plasma islet amyloid <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> was measured by radioimmunoassay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the non-diabetic control subjects, fasting plasma islet amyloid <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> was 6.4 +/- 0.5 fmol/ml (mean +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) and was about 1/7 less in molar basis than in insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The fasting islet amyloid <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> level rose in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients and fell in patients with Type 1 (insulin-dependent) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In non-<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo> and Type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetic patients without insulin therapy, the level was equal to that of the control subjects, but a low concentration of islet amyloid <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> relative to insulin or C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> was observed in the non-<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> Type 2 diabetic group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patterns of plasma islet amyloid <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> responses after oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> were similar to those of insulin or C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, compared to non-<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients, a hyper-response of islet amyloid <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> relative to C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> was noted in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> patients who had a hyper-response of insulin relative to C-<z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that basal hypo-secretion of islet amyloid <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> relative to insulin exists in non-<z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and that circulating islet amyloid <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> may act physiologically with insulin to modulate the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
