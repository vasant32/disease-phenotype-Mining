<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The plasma concentration of the adipocyte-derived <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> adiponectin is decreased in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The adiponectin gene is located on chromosome 3q27, where a <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> susceptibility locus has been mapped </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Adiponectin gene polymorphisms (single nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs]) have been associated with BMI, insulin sensitivity, and type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in some cross-sectional studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to assess the contribution of these SNPs in the development of features of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> syndrome in a 3-year prospective study in approximately 4,500 French Caucasian subjects from the Epidemiologic Data on the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>Insulin Resistance</z:hpo> Syndrome (DESIR) cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For subjects who were normoglycemic at baseline, the 3-year risk of becoming hyperglycemic (<z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or impaired fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>) was affected by two SNPs: G-11391A and T45G </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For G-11391A, the risk was increased in GA carriers (odds ratio [OR] adjusted for sex [versus GG] = 1.60 [95% CI 1.16-2.20]; P = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For T45G, it was increased in GG carriers (OR [versus TT] = 2.71 [1.31-5.60]; P = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After 3 years, GG subjects had a greater increase in BMI (P = 0.009) and waist-to-hip ratio (P = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Adiponectin levels at baseline were associated with the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> (P = 0.005), but the predictive effects on the risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> were independent of adiponectin genotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, in the DESIR study, variations at the adiponectin locus affect body <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp>, body fat distribution, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo>, as well as adiponectin levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Adiponectin gene SNPs may have several phenotypic effects that co-occur with the development of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
