<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: Characterization of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> in the skin of the Vietnamese common lowland frog Hoplobatrachus rugulosus with the ability to stimulate insulin release in vitro and improve <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">Peptides</z:chebi> in an extract of skin were purified by reversed-phase HPLC, and their abilities to stimulate the release of insulin and the cytosolic enzyme <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase were determined using BRIN-BD11 clonal β cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Insulin-releasing potencies of synthetic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> and their effects on membrane potential and intracellular Ca²⁺ concentration were also measured using BRIN-BD11 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Effects on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance and insulin release in vivo were determined in mice fed a high-fat diet to induce <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A cyclic dodecapeptide (RVCSAIPLPICH.NH₂), termed tigerinin-1R, was isolated from the skin extract that lacked short-term cytotoxic and haemolytic activity but significantly (p &lt; 0.01) stimulated the rate of release of insulin from BRIN-BD11 cells at concentrations ≥ 0.1 nM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The maximum response was 405% of the basal rate at 5.6 mM ambient <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration and 290% of basal rate at 16.7 mM <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>C-terminal α-amidation was necessary for high potency and a possible mechanism of action of the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-involved membrane depolarization and an increase in intracellular Ca²⁺ concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Administration of tigerinin-1R (75 nmol/kg body weight) to high fat-fed mice significantly (p &lt; 0.05) enhanced insulin release and <z:mp ids='MP_0005292'>improved glucose tolerance</z:mp> during the 60-min period following an intraperitoneal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> load </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Tigerinin-1R is a potent, non-toxic insulin-releasing <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> that shows potential for development into an agent for the treatment of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
