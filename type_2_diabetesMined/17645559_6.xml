<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was designed to further evaluate its mode of action on insulin sensitivity over an extended period of time as well as the effects on fibrinogen and other markers of low-grade <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this randomized trial, 27 patients with T2DM on diet only received 4 g of Caiapo daily for 5 months; 34 patients placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Before and after therapy, insulin sensitivity [oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> insulin sensitivity (OGIS), as <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> clearance from oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test], parameters of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> control, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, plasma adiponectin, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and fibrinogen were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Following Caiapo, we observed an increase in OGIS (293 +/- 15 vs. 321 +/- 12 ml/m(2)/min, p = 0.0072) and adiponectin (5.97 +/- 0.65 to 6.63 +/- 0.70 microg/ml, p = 0.013), while fibrinogen decreased from 3.83 +/- 0.16 to 3.64 +/- 0.18 mg/ml (p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This was associated with an improvement in glycated <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbA1c: 6.46 +/- 0.12 vs. 6.25 +/- 0.11%, p = 0.008), fasting <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (138 +/- 4 vs. 128 +/- 5 mg/dl, p = 0.039) and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> (2.36 +/- 0.22 vs. 2.07 +/- 0.25 mmol/l, p = 0.032) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Body weight, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> levels and hs-CRP were not altered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No changes were observed in the placebo group except for HbA1c, which significantly increased from 6.25 +/- 0.10 to 6.50 +/- 0.12% (p = 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the beneficial effects of Caiapo on <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and HbA1c control in patients with T2DM after 5 months follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Improvement of insulin sensitivity was accompanied by increased levels of adiponectin and a decrease in fibrinogen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, Caiapo can be considered as natural insulin sensitizer with potential antiatherogenic properties </plain></SENT>
