<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Dapagliflozin, a selective inhibitor of <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> cotransporter 2 (SGLT2), reduces <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> by increasing urinary <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> excretion independent of insulin and may cause fewer of these adverse effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We compared the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of dapagliflozin with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26831">sulfonylurea</z:chebi> glipizide in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> inadequately controlled with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> monotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This 52-week, double-blind, multicenter, active-controlled, noninferiority trial randomized patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (baseline mean HbA(1c), 7.7%), who were receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> monotherapy, to add-on dapagliflozin (n = 406) or glipizide (n = 408) up-titrated over 18 weeks, based on glycemic response and tolerability, to ≤10 or ≤20 mg/day, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The primary end point, adjusted mean HbA(1c) reduction with dapagliflozin (-0.52%) compared with glipizide (-0.52%), was statistically noninferior at 52 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Key secondary end points: dapagliflozin produced significant adjusted mean <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> (-3.2 kg) versus <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> (1.2 kg; P &lt; 0.0001) with glipizide, significantly increased the proportion of patients achieving ≥5% body weight reduction (33.3%) versus glipizide (2.5%; P &lt; 0.0001), and significantly decreased the proportion experiencing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> (3.5%) versus glipizide (40.8%; P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Events suggestive of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0729552" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genital infections</z:e> and lower <z:hpo ids='HP_0000010'>urinary tract infections</z:hpo> were reported more frequently with dapagliflozin compared with glipizide but responded to standard treatment and rarely led to study discontinuation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Despite similar 52-week glycemic efficacy, dapagliflozin <z:mp ids='MP_0001262'>reduced weight</z:mp> and produced less <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo> than glipizide in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> inadequately controlled with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Long-term studies are required to further evaluate genital and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000010'>urinary tract infections</z:hpo> with SGLT2 inhibitors </plain></SENT>
