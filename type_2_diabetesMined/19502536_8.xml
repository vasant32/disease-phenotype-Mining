<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and long-term effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> on thyroid axis hormones were assessed in diabetic patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000832'>primary hypothyroidism</z:hpo> who were either untreated or treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18332">levothyroxine</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="18332">L-T4</z:chebi>), as well as in diabetic patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> thyroid function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> changes were found in 11 patients with treated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000821'>hypothyroidism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After 1 year of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> administration, a significant thyrotropin (TSH) decrease (P &lt; 0.001) was observed in diabetic subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000821'>hypothyroidism</z:hpo> who were either treated (n = 29; from 2.37 +/- 1.17 to 1.41 +/- 1.21 mIU/l) or untreated (n = 18; 4.5 +/- 0.37 vs. 2.93 +/- 1.48) with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18332">L-T4</z:chebi>, but not in 54 euthyroid subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No significant change in free T4 (FT4) was observed in any group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">Metformin</z:chebi> administration influences TSH without change of FT4 in patients with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and concomitant <z:hpo ids='HP_0000821'>hypothyroidism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The need for reevaluation of thyroid function in these patients within 6-12 months after starting <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> is indicated </plain></SENT>
