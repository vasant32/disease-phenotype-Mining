<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>When <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> is taken orally, insulin secretion is stimulated much more than it is when <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> is infused intravenously so as to result in similar <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This effect, which is called the incretin effect and is estimated to be responsible for 50 to 70% of the insulin response to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, is caused mainly by the two intestinal insulin-stimulating hormones, glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 (GLP-1) and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-dependent insulinotropic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> (GIP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Their contributions have been confirmed in mimicry experiments, in experiments with <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> of their actions, and in experiments where the genes encoding their receptors have been deleted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In patients with Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, the incretin effect is either greatly impaired or absent, and it is assumed that this could contribute to the inability of these patients to adjust their insulin secretion to their needs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In studies of the mechanism of the impaired incretin effect in Type 2 diabetic patients, it has been found that the secretion of GIP is generally <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, whereas the secretion of GLP-1 is reduced, presumably as a consequence of the diabetic state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It might be of even greater importance that the effect of GLP-1 is preserved whereas the effect of GIP is severely impaired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The impaired GIP effect seems to have a genetic background, but could be aggravated by the diabetic state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The preserved effect of GLP-1 has inspired attempts to treat Type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> with GLP-1 or analogues thereof, and intravenous GLP-1 administration has been shown to be able to near-normalize both fasting and postprandial glycaemic concentrations in the patients, perhaps because the treatment compensates for both the impaired secretion of GLP-1 and the impaired action of GIP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Several GLP-1 analogues are currently in clinical development and the reported results are, so far, encouraging </plain></SENT>
