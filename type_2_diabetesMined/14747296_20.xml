<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied insulin secretion (by hyperglycemic clamp) in 3-, 9-, and 20-month-old chronically catheterized, awake, Sprague Dawley (SD) rats (n = 78) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Insulin action was modulated in a group of old rats by caloric restriction (CR) or by surgical removal of visceral fat (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e>-) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During the first 2 h of the clamp (11 mmol/l <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>), insulin secretion and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> (S(i hyper clamp)) demonstrated the characteristic hyperbolic relationship </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> for an additional 2 h, the ability to maintain insulin secretion, commensurate with the degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, was decreased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> aging rats (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Increasing plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels to 18 mmol/l <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, after clamp at 11 mmol/l, <z:mp ids='MP_0003058'>increased insulin secretion</z:mp> by approximately threefold in young rats, but failed to induce similar magnitude of response in the aging rats ( approximately 50%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, elevation of plasma free fatty acid (FFA) levels by twofold (by intralipid infusion during 11 mmol/l <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> clamp) resulted in a robust, approximate twofold response in both young and old rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, prolonged stimulation by <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> unveiled a functional defect in insulin secretion with aging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This age-related defect is independent of insulin action and is specific to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and not FFAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We suggest that prolonged hyperglycemic stimulation can be a tool to identify functional defects in insulin secretion, particularly in the context of the hyperbolic relationship with insulin action, in elderly subjects or those at risk for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
