<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Newly available therapies for type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> target the pathway of the incretin hormone glucagon-like <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-1 (GLP-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Oral inhibitors of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) raise the level of endogenous GLP-1 by inhibiting its clearance thereby lowering fasting and postprandial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Unlike compounds which act as <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> of the GLP-1 receptor, DPP-4 inhibitors are not associated with significant effects on gastrointestinal motility, which led to a controversy around the mechanisms responsible for their <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-lowering effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here we review the evidence in regards to the mechanisms whereby DPP-4 inhibitors lower <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Their effects are most likely mediated by an increase in endogenous GLP-1, although additional mechanisms may be involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The pharmacology, efficacy and safety of vildagliptin, a novel DPP-4 inhibitor, are also discussed </plain></SENT>
