<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Little information is available regarding the expression of this molecule in human health or disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Exposure of isolated human adipocytes to insulin enhanced SREBP1 gene expression and promoted its proteolytic cleavage to the active form </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, 3 h of in vivo <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> also significantly increased SREBP1 gene expression in human skeletal muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transcript levels of SREBP1c, the most abundant isoform in adipose tissue, were significantly decreased in the subcutaneous adipose tissue of <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> normoglycemic and type 2 diabetic subjects compared with that of nonobese normoglycemic control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In skeletal muscle, SREBP1 expression was significantly reduced in type 2 diabetic subjects but not in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Within the diabetic group, the extent of SREBP1 suppression was inversely related to metabolic control and was normalized by 3 h of in vivo <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Exposure of isolated human adipocytes to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) produced a marked and specific decrease in the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> encoding the SREBP1c isoform and completely blocked the insulin-induced cleavage of SREBP1 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, both the expression and proteolytic maturation of human SREBP1 are positively modulated by insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The specific reduction in the SREBP1c isoform seen in the adipose tissue of <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> and type 2 diabetic subjects can be recapitulated ex vivo by TNF-alpha, suggesting a possible mechanism for this association </plain></SENT>
