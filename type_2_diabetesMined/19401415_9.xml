<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Insufficient insulin secretion is a hallmark of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and exposure of beta-cells to elevated <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> levels (lipotoxicity) contributes to secretory dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Functional ablation of protein kinase C epsilon (PKCepsilon) has been shown to improve <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis in models of type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and, in particular, to enhance <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) after <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we investigated the <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-dependent mechanisms responsible for the enhanced GSIS after inactivation of PKCepsilon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We cultured islets isolated from PKCepsilon knockout (PKCepsilonKO) mice in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi> prior to measuring GSIS, Ca(2+) responses, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi> esterification products, lipolysis, lipase activity, and gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The enhanced GSIS could not be explained by increased expression of another PKC isoform or by alterations in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-stimulated Ca(2+) influx </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Instead, an upregulation of the amplifying pathways of GSIS in <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-cultured PKCepsilonKO beta-cells was revealed under conditions in which functional ATP-sensitive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> channels were bypassed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we showed increased esterification of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi> into <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> pools and an enhanced rate of lipolysis and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> lipase activity in PKCepsilonKO islets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> treatment with the lipase inhibitor orlistat blocked the enhancement of GSIS in <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-cultured PKCepsilonKO islets, suggesting that a lipolytic product mediates the enhancement of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-amplified insulin secretion after PKCepsilon deletion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate a mechanistic link between lipolysis and the amplifying pathways of GSIS in murine beta-cells, and they suggest an interaction between PKCepsilon and lipolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results further highlight the therapeutic potential of PKCepsilon inhibition to enhance GSIS from the beta-cell under conditions of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> excess </plain></SENT>
