<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Sleep deprivation is associated with increased risk of adult type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (T2DM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is uncertain whether sleep deprivation and/or altered sleep architecture affects glycemic regulation or insulin sensitivity or secretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> adolescents, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002360'>sleep disturbances</z:hpo> would associate with altered <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and insulin homeostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This cross-sectional observational study of 62 <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> adolescents took place at the Clinical and Translational Research Center and Sleep Laboratory in a tertiary care children's hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subjects underwent oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (OGTT), anthropometric measurements, overnight polysomnography, and frequently sampled intravenous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (FSIGT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">Hemoglobin</z:chebi> A(1c) (HbA(1c)) and serial insulin and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels were obtained, indices of insulin sensitivity and secretion were calculated, and sleep architecture was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Correlation and regression analyses were performed to assess the association of total sleep and sleep stages with measures of insulin and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> homeostasis, adjusted for confounding variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found significant U-shaped (quadratic) associations between sleep duration and both HbA(1c) and serial <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels on OGTT and positive associations between slow-wave sleep <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29448">(N3)</z:chebi> duration and insulin secretory measures, independent of degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, pubertal stage, sex, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002870'>obstructive sleep apnea</z:hpo> measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Insufficient and excessive sleep was associated with short-term and long-term <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> in our <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> adolescents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Decreased N3 was associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0003059'>decreased insulin secretion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These effects may be related, with reduced insulin secretory capacity leading to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We speculate that optimizing sleep may stave off the development of T2DM in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> adolescents </plain></SENT>
