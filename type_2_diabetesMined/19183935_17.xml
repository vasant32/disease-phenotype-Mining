<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ten lean healthy, ten <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> non-diabetic and ten type 2 diabetic participants received a euglycaemic-hyperinsulinaemic clamp to measure whole body insulin sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mitochondria were isolated from skeletal muscle biopsies, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> ATP synthesis and <z:chebi fb="17" ids="16240">hydrogen peroxide</z:chebi> production were measured ex vivo under conditions that maximally stimulate ATP synthesis and ROS production using chemiluminescent and fluorescent techniques, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with lean controls, both <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> non-diabetic and type 2 diabetic participants were resistant to insulin, and had a reduced rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> ATP production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>Obese</z:mp> insulin-resistant participants had a decreased rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> ROS production, while ROS production rate in participants with type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> was similar to that in lean healthy participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In non-diabetic participants, the rate of ROS production was strongly correlated with the rate of ATP synthesis and the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> disposal rate measured with the euglycaemic-hyperinsulinaemic clamp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The ROS/ATP ratio in <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> insulin-resistant participants was similar to that in lean insulin-sensitive participants, while the ratio was significantly elevated in type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Since, in absolute terms, the maximal capacity for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> ROS production was not increased in either <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> insulin-resistant participants or in type 2 diabetic participants, these results do not favour a role for increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> ROS production in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> in human skeletal muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, care should be taken in extrapolating these ex vivo observations to the in vivo situation </plain></SENT>
