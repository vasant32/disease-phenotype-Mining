The prognostic value of magnetic evoked potentials (MEP), somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP), age and radiological parameters was determined in 50 patients with acute middle cerebral artery infarction. We performed MEP and SSEP within 4 days and after 6 weeks and 3 months of the infarction and assessed clinical improvement by using the Barthel index (BI) and the Rankin scale. The localization and extent of the infarction was investigated by CT scanning or NMR. All parameters were correlated to clinical outcome and the prognostic significance of each parameter in addition to BI was determined. MEP, SSEP, and age were valuable prognostic parameters in predicting stroke outcome when used together with the BI. However, in stepwise regression analysis using all parameters simultaneously, only MEP and age significantly contributed to clinical outcome in addition to BI. Patients showed a better outcome when their MEP was normal or delayed, measured within 4 days of the infarction, compared to patients with absent MEP. Clinical outcome was better at a younger age.
