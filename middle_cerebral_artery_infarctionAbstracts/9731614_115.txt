BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Malignant, space-occupying supratentorial ischemic stroke is characterized by a mortality rate of up to 80%. Several reports indicate a beneficial effect of hemicraniectomy in this situation. However, whether and when decompressive surgery is indicated in these patients is still a matter of debate. METHODS: In an open, prospective trial we performed hemicraniectomy in 63 patients with acute complete middle cerebral artery infarction. Initial clinical presentation was assessed by the Scandinavian Stroke Scale (SSS) and the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS). All survivors were reexamined 3 months after surgical decompression, with the clinical evaluation graded according to the Rankin Scale (RS) and Barthel Index (BI). We analyzed the influence of early decompressive surgery (<24 hours after symptom onset, based on clinical status at admission and initial CT findings) versus late surgery (>24 hours after first reversible signs of herniation) on mortality, functional outcome, and the length of time of critical care therapy was needed. RESULTS: In total, 46 patients (73%) survived. Despite complete hemispheric infarction, no survivor suffered from complete hemiplegia or was permanently wheelchair bound. In patients with speech-dominant hemispheric infarction (n=11), only mild to moderate aphasia was present. The mean BI score was 65, and RS score revealed severe handicap in 13% of the patients. In 31 patients with early decompressive surgery, mortality was 16% and BI score 68.8. Early hemicraniectomy led to a significant reduction in the length of time critical care therapy was needed (7.4 versus 13.3 days, P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In general, the outcome of patients treated with craniectomy in severe ischemic hemispheric infarction was surprisingly good. In addition, early decompressive surgery may further improve outcome in these patients.
