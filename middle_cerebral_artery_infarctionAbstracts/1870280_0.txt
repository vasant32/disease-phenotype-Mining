A neuroradiological study of crossed cerebellar atrophy (CCA) was performed using X-ray CT in 103 patients suffering from unilateral supratentorial cerebrovascular diseases. CCA was demonstrated in 9 (8.7%) of 103 patients. No difference between the occurrence of CCA in cerebral hemorrhage and that in cerebral infarction was found. CCA was seen in the chronic stage of cerebrovascular disease more than 3 years since stroke occurrence, and was found to be present more frequently and to a greater extent 7 years later. No correlation between the site of bleeding and the occurrence of CCA was found. Trans-synaptic degeneration of the corticopontocerebellar tract was considered in CCA following putaminal and combined hemorrhage involving an internal capsule lesion. However, in thalamic hemorrhage, retrograde degeneration within the cerebellorubrothalamic tract was presumed. CCA following cerebral infarction was seen in patients with massive lesions in the territory of the middle cerebral artery. Multivariate analysis showed that lesions of the parietal and frontal lobes appeared to greatly contribute to the development of CCA. As the degeneration and atrophy in the thalamus on the side of the lesion appeared early and frequently, it was suggested that retrograde degeneration of the cerebellorubrothalamic tract participated, in addition to anterograde corticopontocerebellar tract degeneration, in CCA following middle cerebral artery infarction. It is likely that CCA is caused by both transsynaptic degeneration of the corticopontocerebellar tract and the cerebellorubrothalamic tract.
