Microdialysis is a means of measuring neurochemical changes in the extracellular space and has been applied in acute brain trauma, subarachnoid hemorrhage and stroke patients. In this study, we monitored neurochemical changes in the extracellular space using microdialysis in a patient with left-sided hemispheric infarction treated with moderate hypothermia (33 degrees C). Microdialysis probes were obtained from the infarcted and noninfarcted hemisphere during hypothermia and rewarming. Concentrations of extracellular substances in the infarcted hemisphere (glutamate, glycerine, lactate/pyruvate) decreased with hypothermia and remained stable (glutamate) or increased (glycerine, lactate/pyruvate) during rewarming. Concentrations of these substances in the noninfarcted hemisphere remained at normal levels. Microdialysis monitoring of therapeutic hypothermia in severe hemispheric infarction might be a useful additional monitoring tool to assess the status of the brain and to predict further deterioration.
