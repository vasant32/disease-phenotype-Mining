Space-occupying middle cerebral artery infarction represents about 10 to 15% of supratentorial ischemic strokes. This syndrome carries a high rate of mortality and requires aggressive surgical decompression. The authors present 6 patients with signs of trans-tentorial herniation operated on between February 2001 and August 2003. Neurological preoperative status was evaluated with Glasgow coma scale score and postoperatively with Barthel index. Three patients had excellent recovery (Barthel Index up to 70), one remained dependant and two died. Younger patients had better prognosis. Decompressive surgery, when done early, should improve mortality rate and even functional outcome. Optimal selection of patients, with the help of Diffusion-Weighted imaging, could vouch good results.
