The longer-term outcome of term-born infants without congenital anomalies requiring ventilation in the first 24 h after birth has rarely been reported. Our aims were to determine the mortality and long-term morbidity of such infants and identify risk factors for adverse outcome. The outcomes of 43 of 45 infants born at term consecutively requiring mechanical ventilation were reviewed. The infants had: meconium aspiration syndrome (n = 11), hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE) (n = 11), respiratory depression (n = 12), sepsis (n = 5), persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (n = 3) and middle cerebral artery infarction (n = 1). Eleven infants developed seizures (26%), 13 (30%) had abnormal electroencephalograms and 11 (26%) had abnormal MRI scans; 26% had an adverse outcome: six died, and five had severe neurodisability at 2 years. The infants with congenital toxoplasmosis and a middle cerebral artery infarction were excluded from the prediction analysis. In the remaining 41 patients, requirement for anticonvulsants (relative risk, RR = 4.44, 95% CI = 1.48 to 12.70; p = 0.014) and prolonged ventilation (longer than 3 days) (RR 4.83, 95% CI 1.51 to 15.64) predicted adverse outcome. Infants with HIE had an increased risk of adverse outcome (relative risk 5.45, 95% CI 1.01 to 33.85), but an adverse outcome occurred in infants with other diagnoses. CONCLUSION: Mortality and neurodisability at follow-up were common in infants born at term without major congenital anomalies who required mechanical ventilation in the first 24 h after birth, particularly in those who developed seizures requiring treatment and prolonged ventilation.
