Patients with a hemispheric infarct and massive space-occupying brain oedema have a poor prognosis. Despite intensive conservative treatment, the case fatality rate may be as high as 80%, and most survivors are left severely disabled. Non-randomised studies suggest that decompressive surgery substantially reduces mortality and improves the functional outcome of survivors. The 'Hemicraniectomy after middle cerebral artery infarction with life-threatening edema trial' (HAMLET) is a newly-conceived randomised multi-centre clinical trial that compares the efficacy of decompressive surgery to improve functional outcome with that of conservative treatment in patients with space-occupying supratentorial infarction.
