We describe the clinical course and outcome following decompressive craniectomy in six patients. Five patients suffered from severe intracranial hypertension due to middle cerebral artery infarction. In one patient the cause was bacterial meningoencephalitis. Acute clinical and neuroradiological signs of intracranial hypertension were seen in all cases. Following ineffective conventional brain edema therapy, decompressive craniectomy was undertaken. In five cases intracranial pressure was sufficiently lowered. One patient developed transtentorial herniation with subsequent brain death. Four patients with middle artery infarction showed moderate neurological disorders and one patient with bacterial meningoencephalitis recovered completely after treatment. Craniectomy in malignant middle artery infarction should be taken into consideration if conventional brain edema therapy does not sufficiently reduce critically raised intracranial pressure. Craniectomy provides development of brain herniation. This treatment may reduce high lethality rate and high frequency of severe neurological disorders.
