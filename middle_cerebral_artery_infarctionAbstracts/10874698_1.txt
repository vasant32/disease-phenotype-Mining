The size and severity of perfusion defects in acute cerebral ischaemia on single photon emission tomographic (SPET) images may provide useful information regarding long-term (> 3 month) stroke outcome. A decreased predictive value has been reported with delayed SPET more than 24 h after stroke onset. We examined 20 patients with acute middle cerebral artery (MCA) infarctions using serial 99Tcm-ECD or 99Tcm-HMPAO SPET (SPET 1 one day and SPET 2 three days after stroke onset). Neurological (NIH, SSS) and functional (Barthel, Rankin) scores were calculated simultaneously and 3 months poststroke. The two SPET scans correlated equally well with the severity of functional and neurological deficits evaluated 3 months after stroke onset. In comparison to clinical assessment, the prognostic value of SPET was relatively better on the first day than the third day. Crossed cerebellar diaschisis correlated with early SPET deficits, but did not predict functional outcome. Our results suggest that SPET, either with 99Tcm-ECD or 99Tcm-HMPAO, can be used to predict stroke outcome in acute MCA infarction up to 72 h poststroke without significant interference from luxury perfusion.
