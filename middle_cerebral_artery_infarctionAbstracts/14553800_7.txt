Initial reports indicate that cerebral perfusion deficits in acute ischemic stroke might be detectable by means of transcranial harmonic imaging after an ultrasound contrast agent (UCA) bolus injection. Twenty-four patients with acute middle cerebral artery (MCA) infarction were investigated twice with perfusion harmonic imaging (PHI) after Levovist (Schering, Berlin, Germany) bolus injection no longer than 12 h after symptom onset. The findings were compared with those of cranial computed tomography (CCT). All 24 patients suffered from acute ischemic stroke of the MCA territory (median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score: 15 points). Corresponding to the area of infarction in follow-up CCT, a marked contrast deficit was visualized in 19 of 24 patients by initial PHI, which had a sensitivity and specificity of 86.4% and 96.2%, respectively, for predicting the occurrence and localization of a definite infarction in the midthalamic plane. The area of hypoperfusion in the initial PHI investigation correlated with the definite area of infarction in follow-up CCT (r=0.66, p<0.01). When time-intensity curves of both hemispheres were compared, the areas under the curve were significantly less in the symptomatic brain regions (p=0.01). With PHI and UCA bolus injection, it is possible to assess cerebral perfusion deficits that correlate with the definite area of infarction in acute ischemic stroke patients.
