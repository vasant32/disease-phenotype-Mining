A 60 year-old hypertensive male was operated with resection of epidermoid carcinoma of buccal mucosa. He was expired postoperation complicated with left middle cerebral artery infarction. The cerebral infarction may be induced by acute hypotension, improper position during operation and underlying disease associated with old age. Prevention methods included preoperative evaluation, immediately injection vasopressor when acute hypotension occurred during anesthesia, and avoidance of improper position to compress vertebral or carotid artery which may leading to cerebral perfusion insufficiency.
