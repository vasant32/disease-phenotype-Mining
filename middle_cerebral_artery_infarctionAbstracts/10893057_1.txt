BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To evaluate the functional prognostic value of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy performed within the 5 days of an infarction of the middle cerebral artery territory, compared with previously demonstrated prognostic factors. METHODS: Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy was performed on 77 consecutive non-comatosed patients during the acute stage of middle cerebral artery infarction. The functional status was determined for each patient via the Orgogozo score. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic data were acquired in the infarction and in contra-lateral normal tissue and the results were expressed as metabolite ratios. Correlations were evaluated between the Orgogozo score at day 1 and day 30, the age, the sex, the volume of the infarction, and the metabolic ratios. RESULTS: In a monovariate analysis, the decrease of the NAA/choline ratio was correlated with a low Orgogozo score at days 1 and 30 (P<0.05) and with a large infarction (P<0.05). A stepwise analysis showed a significant relationship between the Orgogozo score at day 30 and the Orgogozo score at day 1, the sex, the volume of infarction, and the NAA/Cho ratio within the infarction. CONCLUSIONS: Our work demonstrates that a good clinical outcome at day 30 depends on a good initial clinical score at day 1, a small volume of infarction, a small decrease of NAA/Cho, and being of the female gender.
