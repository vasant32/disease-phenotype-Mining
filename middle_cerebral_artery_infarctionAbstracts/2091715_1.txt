Thirteen patients with clinically and radiographically defined right middle cerebral artery infarction were studied using EEG, quantitative electroencephalographic (QEEG) spectra, and multi-channel evoked potentials. The purpose of this effort was to develop QEEG rules that related to the patient's neurologic status. Three QEEG relative delta spectral patterns were identified in the right hemisphere which related to neurologic residua. These include limited perisylvian involvement, mixed involvement of perisylvian and extrasylvian regions, and extrasylvian involvement only. While there were parallels between QEEG spectral patterns and auditory, visual and somatosensory evoked potentials, there were modality specific features consistent with functional differences.
