INTRODUCTION: Functional hemispherectomy is a surgical technique used to treat refractory epilepsies in the setting of extensive unilateral hemispheric lesions. Most series of hemispherectomies include mainly pediatric patients. METHODS: We report our series of four adult patients that have undergone functional hemispherectomy for their refractory epilepsy. Each one had a complete presurgical evaluation including video EEG, neuropsychological testing and anatomical and functional neuroimaging. In three of them, the epilepsy was secondary to a middle cerebral artery infarction. One patient had Rasmussen encephalitis. RESULTS: After surgery, three patents have become completely seizure free (follow up 13-26 months). The fourth patient has had more than 75% reduction in seizure frequency. All of them have had significant improvement in their quality of life. Early complications included an isolated tonic-clonic generalized seizure (one patient), and status epilepticus in another patients related to infection and use of meropenem. Only one patient has presented hemianopia as a permanent neurological deficit after surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Functional hemispherectomy is a good surgical option in the setting of large unilateral hemispheric lesions causing hemiparesis and intractable seizures, even in adult patients.
