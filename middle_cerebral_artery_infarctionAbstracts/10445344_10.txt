We report on a patient who presented at 5 years of age with a hemiparesis due to a middle cerebral artery infarction. An embolism had originated from a mycotic aneurysm located in the internal carotid artery. For several months prior to admission he had been suffering from therapeutically resistant candidiasis of the mouth and nails. Family history revealed chronic mycotic infections of the skin, hair, nails and mouth in the father and paternal grandmother suggestive of chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis with autosomal dominant mode of inheritance. Clipping of the aneurysm, after 3 months of anti-mycotic treatment, followed by sustained treatment with itraconazole and fluconazole, led to a favourable outcome. CONCLUSION: Chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis can be associated with an intracranial aneurysm and complicated by cerebral infarction.
