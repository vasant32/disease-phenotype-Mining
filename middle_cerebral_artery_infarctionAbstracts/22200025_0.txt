A lesion that is hyperintense on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and hypointense on the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map is a characteristic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) finding in acute ischemic infarction. In some cases, however, these findings can persist for a few months after infarct onset. It is thought that these finding reflect the different evolution speeds of the infarcted tissue. We report a patient with a right middle cerebral artery territory infarction with persistent hyperintensity on DWI and hypointensity on the ADC map for over 8 months. To our knowledge, this is the most persistent case of hyperintensity lesion on DWI and the serial MRI images of this patient provide important information on the evolution of infarcted tissue.
