We report a young lady with acute left middle cerebral artery infarction after acute intake of amphetamine. This is the first case report of amphetamine-induced ischemic stroke with serial angiography and transcranial color-coded Doppler studies. The temporal sequence of stenosis of at least 3 weeks with subsequent complete resolution by 3 months and a "beaded" appearance on angiography support vasculitis or vasospasm as the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke in this patient. The presence of microembolic signals supports acute thrombosis at the site of vasculitis/vasospasm with distal embolism.
