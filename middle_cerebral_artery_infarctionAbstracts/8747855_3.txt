The significance of ipsilateral thalamic diaschisis (ITD) among patients with chronic, stable middle cerebral artery (MCA) infarcts was investigated. Twenty eight subjects with chronic MCA infarction and twenty two normal controls were studied with positron emission tomography (PET), using the steady state technique with 15O. Stroke patients were subdivided into a group with ITD (n = 12) and a group without ITD (n = 16). Patients with ITD had greater decreases of regional blood flow (rCBF) and oxygen consumption (rCMRO2) in the infarcted MCA territory, compared to MCA infarction without ITD. The neurological deficits at the time of PET scanning were similar between both groups. Extent of infarction by CT brain scan appeared more predominant in peri-insular regions of patients with ITD, while in non diaschisis patients infarcts were more widely distributed throughout the MCA territories. Occurrence of ITD and of crossed cerebellar diaschisis (CCD) did not correlate. Occurrence of ITD seems to be linked to diffuse reductions of blood flow and oxygen metabolism in cortical territories of the MCA. Mechanisms of ITD were different from those of CCD.
