A 37-year-old woman suffered from middle cerebral artery infarction secondary to dissection of the left internal carotid artery. Nine days before, a cesarean section had been performed on her after 20 h of unsuccessful labor. Cerebral angiography at admission revealed no further vascular abnormalities. A few days later, however, the patient developed additional dissections of the right internal carotid artery and both vertebral arteries. Pregnancy, childbirth, and a history of rheumatoid arthritis in this patient may have contributed to the dissections; however, due to the unknown etiology of cervical dissections, the pathogenetic contribution of all of these factors is incompletely understood.
