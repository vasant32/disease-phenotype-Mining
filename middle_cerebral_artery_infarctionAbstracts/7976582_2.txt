The present study is a second analysis of a randomized double-blind controlled trial on the efficacy of neurotropin on brain edema in a subgroup of patients with acute middle cerebral artery infarct treated within 24 hours. Neurotropin is a biological extract that specifically inhibits the release of bradykinin. The mortality rate was significantly lower in the neurotropin than in the placebo group. In the surviving patients the neurological deficit decreased to a significantly greater extent by neurotropin therapy after 15 days. The CT scan findings in the brain of the neurotropin-treated patients demonstrated a significant reduction in the size of the infarct and of the edematous area. Patients with middle cerebral artery infarct, which is prone to give rise to fatal intracranial hypertension, may derive great benefit from treatment of brain edema with neurotropin.
