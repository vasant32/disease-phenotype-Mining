Transient cortical blindness following intra-arterial catheter angiography is a known rare complication. We report the case of a 56-year-old man who suffered from transient cortical blindness and neuropsychological deficits after coronary angiography. Serial CT scans revealed reversible pathologic parenchymal contrast enhancement of the right occipital lobe as well as left middle cerebral artery infarction at the same time. CT changes and time course of clinical symptoms are presented and discussed for both lesions of presumably different etiology.
