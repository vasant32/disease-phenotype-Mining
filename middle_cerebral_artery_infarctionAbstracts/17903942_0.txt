Pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) is a rare hematological disorder characterized by an isolated depletion of erythroid precursors with preservation of other cell lines. Neurological concomitants are not a recognized feature. We report a case of unexplained middle cerebral artery infarction in a 32-year-old woman with PRCA. This concurrence may reflect a predisposition to ischemic stroke in patients with PRCA.
