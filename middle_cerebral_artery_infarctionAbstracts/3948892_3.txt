Computed tomography (CT) was performed in 14 cases of tuberculous meningitis (TBM), 12 of which were examined during the acute phase of the disease. CT findings in these cases included internal hydrocephalus (6/12), internal combined with external hydrocephalus (2/12), focal lesions consistent with localized encephalitis (3/12), diffuse brain edema (1/12), and middle cerebral artery infarction (1/12). In comparison to 32 cases of nonspecific bacterial meningitis, internal hydrocephalus was found significantly more often in TBM than in nonspecific meningitis (p less than 0.01) making CT an additional tool for the differentiation of these conditions in doubtful cases. In addition, CT features of 2 cases of cerebral tuberculoma are presented.
