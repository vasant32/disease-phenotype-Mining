Malignant middle cerebral territory infarction represents 5 to 10% of all brain infarctions. Its mortality is 80%, due to brain herniation and it is not reduced by medical treatment. Decompressive hemicraniectomy reduces mortality to 12%, and the subsequent quality of life of patients is acceptable. We report two male patients aged 61 and 54 years, with a malignant middle cerebral territory infarction who were treated with decompressive hemicraniectomy. After two years of follow up, both patients are self-sufficient and live at home with their families.
