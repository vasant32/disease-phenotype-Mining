A full-term neonate was born to a 41-year-old woman via elective primary cesarean section for frank breech presentation after a 41-week pregnancy. Starting at 6 hr of age the infant presented with multiple episodes of apnea and cyanosis, in association with moderate hypotonia, subsequently requiring assisted ventilatory support for 2 days. Computerized axial tomography of the brain revealed infarction in the distribution of the left middle cerebral artery. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed a left middle cerebral artery territory infarct and also a small right posterior-temporal infarct. Magnetic resonance angiography of the head and neck was normal, however, inferring that the vascular infarction was peripheral in location. Maternal anticardiolipin antibodies were elevated. This is only the fifth reported case of cerebral infarction in a newborn in association with elevated maternal anticardiolipin antibodies.
