 OBJECTIVES: In acute ischemic stroke, early neurological deterioration (END) has a severe impact on patient outcome. We tested the hypothesis that initial biological aspirin non-responder status (ANRS) helps predict END. METHODS: A total of 85 patients with acute ischemic stroke on 160mg aspirin daily were prospectively included. END was defined as an increase in the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) â‰¥4 points in the first 72h after admission. Platelet responsiveness to aspirin was assessed using the PFA-100 system, and ANRS was defined as a collagen/epinephrine closure time <165ms. RESULTS: END was observed in 10 patients (11.8%). The presumed reasons for END were progressive stroke (40%), recurrent cerebral ischemia (30%), malignant middle cerebral artery infarction (20%) and secondary acute hydrocephalus (10%). Patients with END had a non-significant worse neurological status on the NIHSS at hospital admission (8.4 vs. 4.2; p=0.15). Initial impaired consciousness (30% vs. 3%), visual disturbance (60% vs. 23%) and ANRS (60% vs. 20%) were observed more frequently in patients with END. In multivariate analysis, impaired consciousness (OR: 17.3; 95% CI: 2.0-149.5; p=0.01) and ANRS (OR: 6.4; 95% CI: 1.4-29.6; p=0.017) were found to be independently associated with END. CONCLUSION: ANRS is common in acute ischemic stroke patients and is predictive of END. The clinical significance of these findings requires further evaluation in larger longitudinal studies.
