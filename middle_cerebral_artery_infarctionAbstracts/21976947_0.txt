We report a case of ophthalmic artery obstruction combined with brain infarction following periocular autologous fat injection. The patient, a 44-year-old woman, visited our hospital for decreased visual acuity in her left eye and dysarthria one hour after receiving an autologous fat injection in the periocular area. Her best corrected visual acuity for the concerned eye was no light perception. Also, a relative afferent pupillary defect was detected in this eye. The left fundus exhibited widespread retinal whitening with visible emboli in several retinal arterioles. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed a hyperintense lesion at the left insular cortex. Therefore, we diagnosed ophthalmic artery obstruction and left middle cerebral artery infarction due to fat emboli. The patient was managed with immediate ocular massage, carbon dioxide, and oxygen therapy. Following treatment, dysarthria improved considerably but there was no improvement in visual acuity.
