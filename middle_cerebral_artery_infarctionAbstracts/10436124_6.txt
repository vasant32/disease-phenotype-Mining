BACKGROUND: Second harmonic imaging (SHI) is a new ultrasound technique that is able to detect microbubbles in the tissue vascular space. The aim of this pilot study was to prove that this technique may detect focal abnormalities of cerebral echo-contrast enhancement in acute hemispheric stroke. CASE DESCRIPTIONS: Two male patients (aged 72 and 64 years) were included who presented with acute onset of severe hemiparesis and no established demarcation of the ischemic area in CT scans. After bolus application of galactose-based microbubbles, axial SHI examinations in a diencephalic plane of sections were performed using the transtemporal approach. Ultrasound investigations were recorded and evaluated offline. In both individuals demarcated focal abnormalities of cerebral contrast enhancement were detectable: in patient 1 the region of the lentiform nucleus and the adjacent parts of the temporoparietal lobe was affected, and in patient 2 a large region including the lentiform nucleus and cortical white matter was involved for at least 24 hours. Follow-up CT scans demonstrated a striatocapsular infarct in patient 1 and complete MCA infarction in patient 2, correlating with the presumed ischemic area in acute ultrasound examinations. The patient with complete MCA infarction showed missing contrast enhancement in the entire hemisphere of the affected side in follow-up SHI examinations. He died of malignant space-occupying brain edema. In the patient with the striatocapsular infarction, reappearance of echo-contrast enhancement in the ischemic area was assessable after 1 week. CONCLUSIONS: SHI may identify focal abnormalities of cerebral echo-contrast enhancement in acute hemispheric stroke. Furthermore, this technique helps to determine size, localization, and prognosis of the ischemic region and could be useful for bedside assessment of echo-contrast agent distribution related to brain tissue perfusion.
