Moderate hypothermia (MH) is neuroprotective in animal models of focal ischemia when it is induced during, or within few hours after, onset of ischemia. In patients with acute stroke, several observational studies suggested normothermia or mild hypothermia as independent prognostic factors for favorable outcome. Currently, mild hypothermia was only examined in one clinical study that showed its feasibility and safety, but was not powered to examine efficacy. Limited clinical data on MH in humans suggest that this treatment probably reduces mortality in patients with malignant middle cerebral artery infarction. Still, MH in humans is associated with several side effects, intensive medical treatment, and a prolonged stay in the neurologic intensive care unit. Use of MH should be limited to specialized units, applying this treatment within research protocols or observational studies.
