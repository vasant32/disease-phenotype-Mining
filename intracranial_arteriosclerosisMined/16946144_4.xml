<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We divided 588 consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> into four clinical subgroups to study the blood pressure levels during the initial 6 hospital days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the 6 days, systolic blood pressure of lacunar and atherothrombotic patients was higher (P=0.0001) and diastolic blood pressure of lacunar patients was higher (P=0.0371) than of patients with the other subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Preexisting <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> was associated with elevated <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> systolic blood pressure in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients and in each subtype and with elevated <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> diastolic blood pressure in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, cardioembolic patients, and patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> of other etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After adjustment by preexisting <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> with a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c &gt;7.0% was associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004421'>elevated systolic blood pressure</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, lacunar, and cardioembolic patients and with diastolic blood pressure in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Blood pressure course of patients sustaining <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> varied widely according to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Poorly controlled <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, as well as preexisting <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, appeared to influence blood pressure during the initial week of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
