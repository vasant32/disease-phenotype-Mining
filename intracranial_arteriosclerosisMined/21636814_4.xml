<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: There were limited data on the long-term outcome of patients with symptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis ≥70% after Wingspan stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using our Wingspan cohort data and the data from the <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">Warfarin</z:chebi> and Aspirin for Symptomatic Intracranial Atherosclerotic Disease (WASID) as a historical control, we tested the hypothesis that stenting provided no benefit over antithrombotic therapy alone for these high-risk patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between January 2007 and February 2009, 100 consecutive patients with intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis ≥70% and symptoms within 90 days were enrolled into this prospective single-center Wingspan cohort study and followed up until the end of February 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Stenosis was measured per the WASID criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One-year risk of primary end point (any <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> within 30 days and ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> afterward) was compared with that of ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in the WASID patients with ≥70% stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The stent placement success rate was 99% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients but 1 had clinical follow-up of ≥12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During a mean follow-up of 1.8 years, 9 patients developed primary end point events (5 within 30 days and 4 afterward) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The 1-year risk of the outcome events was lower than that in similar WASID patients: 7.3% (95% CI, 2.0% to 12.5%) versus 18% (95% CI, 13% to 24%; P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The clinical outcome of Wingspan stenting for high-risk intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis patients in this high-volume center study compares favorably with that of antithrombotic therapy alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A randomized trial comparing medical therapy alone with medical therapy plus Wingspan stenting, conducted at high-volume centers, is needed to confirm the stenting benefit </plain></SENT>
