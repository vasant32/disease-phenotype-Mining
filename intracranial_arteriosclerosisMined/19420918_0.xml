<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Given the known benefits of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> in retarding coronary and carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> progression, we studied the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> on asymptomatic middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) stenosis progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> on the progression of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis among <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-free individuals who had mild to moderately elevated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> (3.0-5.0 mmol/l) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two hundred and twenty-seven subjects were randomized to either placebo (n = 114) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> 20 mg daily (n = 113) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The severity of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis at baseline and at the end of the study was graded by MRA into <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, minimal (&lt;10%), mild (10-49%), moderate (50-90%) and severe (&gt;90%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome was the change in grading of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis over 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At the end of the study, the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> level decreased by 1.43 and 0.12 mmol/l for the active and placebo groups, respectively (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in the proportion of patients having stable, progressive and regressive <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis between the placebo (72, 22 and 6%) and active groups (78.6, 15.5 and 5.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality was significantly lower in the active group (n = 0) relative to the placebo group (n = 7, p = 0.014) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Any clinical events were also lower in the active group (n = 5) than in the placebo group (n = 13, p = 0.052) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">Simvastatin</z:chebi> 20 mg daily had no apparent effect upon the evolution of asymptomatic <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis over 2 years </plain></SENT>
