<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have assessed the feasibility of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi>-challenged perfusion MRI for evaluating CVR in symptomatic patients with severe middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) stenosis (â‰¥70%) by comparison with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi>-challenged <z:chebi fb="1" ids="33353">technetium</z:chebi>-99m-hexamethylpropyleneamine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25750">oxime</z:chebi> (HMPAO) single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography (SPECT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventeen prospectively enrolled patients with symptomatic unilateral <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis underwent <z:chebi fb="1" ids="33353">technetium</z:chebi>-99m-hexamethylpropyleneamine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25750">oxime</z:chebi> SPECT and perfusion MRI without and with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> challenge, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">Acetazolamide</z:chebi>-challenged SPECT and perfusion MRI were compared quantitatively by Region of interest (ROI) analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ROIs, there were no significant differences in percent change between SPECT and perfusion MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with impaired CVR showed significant decreases in the percent changes of respective cerebral blood flow (P=.016) and respective cerebral blood volume (P=.029) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">Acetazolamide</z:chebi>-challenged perfusion MRI is feasible for evaluating CVR in symptomatic patients with severe <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis quantitatively </plain></SENT>
