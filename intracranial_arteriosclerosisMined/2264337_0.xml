<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study 844 consecutive patients were evaluated (a) to assess the comparative value of these two methods, (b) to see if there is a correlation between the degree of stenosis and the incidence of neurological symptoms and (c) to find a possible relationship between the plaque structure and the incidence of neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>(a) In 89%, the color-flow assessment was in complete agreement with the duplex assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the remaining 11%, important additional results were discovered in the color flow examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>(b) Non-stenotic plaques were seen more often (43%) in the wide carotic bulb, stenotic plaques and occlusion were found more often (66 and 82%) in the internal carotic artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Vessel occlusion was found most often in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Color-flow Doppler demonstrated a higher incidence of hemodynamic stenosis in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>peripheral vascular disease</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and bruits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>(c) Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> plaques demonstrated a significantly higher risk of neurological deficits than those with homogeneous plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The great advantage of color-flow Doppler is that it enables sonomorphological (plaques, stenoses, occlusion) and functional parameters (turbulences, flow enhancement) to be studied during the same procedure </plain></SENT>
