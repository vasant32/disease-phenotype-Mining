<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The methods used included somatosensory evoked potentials, the assessment of the brachial muscles tone by passive sinusoidal movements of the upper arm and the determination of the curves of the isometric activation of the leg muscles during the stimulation of the feet by tactile and painful stimuli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subclinical impairments of the muscular tone were elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with bilateral changes of the muscle tone show a high risk of the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo>; those with unilateral alterations are at risk of developing a cerebral impairment of the corresponding side </plain></SENT>
