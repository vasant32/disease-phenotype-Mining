<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the angiographic and clinical results of stent placement for atherosclerotic stenosis of the VAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred seventeen consecutive patients with atherosclerotic VAO stenosis were treated with stent placement over a period of 12 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were retrospectively analyzed through the use of a prospectively collected database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The indication criteria for this treatment protocol were symptomatic severe VAO stenoses (&gt; 60%) and asymptomatic severe VAO stenoses (&gt; 60%) with incidentally detected infarction in the posterior circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The target diameter of stent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> from 1997 to 2000 was the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> vessel diameter just distal to the lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moderate overdilation in the proximal portion of the stents has been performed since 2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Successful <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> was obtained in 116 of 117 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Transient neurological complications developed in 2 patients; however, no patients experienced any permanent neurological complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One hundred four patients underwent follow-up angiography at 6 months after stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The restenosis rate at the 6-month follow-up was 9.6% (10 of 104) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Until 2000, the restenosis rate after stenting was 13.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Since 2001, the restenosis rate has decreased to 4.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The median clinical follow-up period was 48 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The annual rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> in the posterior circulation was 0.95% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Stent placement for atherosclerotic VAO stenosis is considered to be a feasible and safe treatment and may be effective for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> prevention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The moderate overdilation of stents may be an effective modality for the prevention of restenosis </plain></SENT>
