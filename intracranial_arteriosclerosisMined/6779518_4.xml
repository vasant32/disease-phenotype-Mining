<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The clinical application of intravenous angiography to study the cervicocerebrovascular system using the digital video subtraction system described in a companion article is reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>About 0.75 ml/kg of a standard 76% <z:chebi fb="60" ids="24859">iodine</z:chebi> contrast solution is injected into an antecubital vein using a power injector </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Then 15-20 exposures of the head and neck region at a 1/<z:chebi fb="63" ids="30000">sec</z:chebi> rate are made on the image intensifier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The images are recorded by a high performance video system and the output signal is digitized for subsequent computer manipulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The subtraction images of these vessels produced by the computer show the vessels clearly, even though they contain very low concentrations of contrast media </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Standard exposure factors of 75-80 kVp, 9-10 msec at 800-1,000 mA are used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinically pertinent features of the data alteration and flow through the system and the step-by-step computer procedures used to achieve and analyze the various forms of subtracted images are described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Five experimental and clinical cases demonstrate appropriate applications to cervicocerebrovascular disease: (1) evaluating the effects of surgical and medical therapy on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>; (2) providing a screening angiographic test for patients with asymptomatic bruits and/or positive noninvasive studies; (3) evaluating patients who have significant generalized <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> either precluding or presenting hazardous contraindications to transarterial catheterization; (4) evaluating significantly aged patients in whom standard angiography has higher risk; and (5) evaluating currently asymptomatic patients who are medically at higher risk for developing <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Numerous examples of the various types of image manipulations are presented: (1) linear subtraction; (2) logarithmic subtraction; (3) alterations of electronic contrast enhancement (map slope); (4) the usefulness of a series of angiographic images; and (5) the importance of multiple projections with this technique </plain></SENT>
