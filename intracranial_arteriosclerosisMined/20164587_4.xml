<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated different vascular risk profiles in relation to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and AD among very old people </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A standardized follow-up procedure was applied three times to a <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>-free cohort (n=1270, age &gt;or= 75) over a nine-year period to detect <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and AD cases using the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="38624">DSM</z:chebi>-III-R criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We examined two vascular risk profiles, which were scored by counting the number of corresponding vascular factors: 1) atherosclerotic profile included systolic pressure &gt;or= 160 mmHg, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0362046" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prediabetes</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>; and 2) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1695782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral hypoperfusion</z:e> profile constituted diastolic pressure &lt; 70 mmHg, pulse pressure &lt; 70 mmHg, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data were analyzed with Cox proportional-hazards models controlling for major potential confounders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During the 6406 person-years of follow-up, 428 subjects developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, including 328 AD cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> components of vascular profiles were significantly or marginally associated with increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo> was increased with increasing score of both risk profiles (p for trend &lt;or= 0.001); subjects with a score &gt;or= 2 in either profile had an approximately twofold-increased risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that aggregation of atherosclerotic- and hypoperfusion-related vascular factors increases the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> in very old people </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Severe cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and insufficient perfusion are involved in the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> including AD </plain></SENT>
