<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>High informative value of the above methods used combined in cases of circulatory pathology in the carotid bed was shown and the differential evaluation of the importance of every individual method in concrete types of cerebrovascular pathology was carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The use of ultrasound and thermovisual methods is considered to be most promising in the diagnosis of vascular cerebral impairments </plain></SENT>
