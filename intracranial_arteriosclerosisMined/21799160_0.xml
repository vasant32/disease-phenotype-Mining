<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Microanatomy studies reveal that most penetrating branches of middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) arise from the dorsal-superior surface of the trunk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using high-resolution MRI, we sought to explore the plaque distribution of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and its clinical relevance in relation to the orifices of penetrating arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the imaging and clinical data of 86 patients with atherosclerotic <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On high-resolution MRI, plaques were categorized based on the involvement of the superior, inferior, ventral, or dorsal <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The relationship of plaque distribution and clinical presentation was analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 92 stenotic <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCAs</z:chebi> (40 symptomatic and 52 asymptomatic) on 828 image slices were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall, of the 251 slices with identified plaques, plaques were more frequently located at the ventral (44.8%) and inferior (31.7%) wall as compared with the superior (14.3%) and dorsal wall (9.0%; P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis had more superior (P=0.016) and less inferior (P=0.023) wall plaques than asymptomatic stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Within the group of symptomatic <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis, vessels with penetrating artery infarctions had more superior (P=0.001) but less ventral (P=0.038) and inferior (P=0.024) plaques than without penetrating artery infarctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> plaques tend to locate opposite to the orifices of penetrating arterial branches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further studies are required to investigate whether <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> plaque distribution is an independent determinant of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> occurrence and its subtypes </plain></SENT>
