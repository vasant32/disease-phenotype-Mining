<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to find out which of the <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> status disorders in patients with ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006111" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain disease</z:e> was the most important risk factor in the development of cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006111" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain disease</z:e> were examined in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Total blood cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low density lipoproteins</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>) and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">high density lipoproteins</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>) as well as of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoproteins</z:chebi> A1 and B were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Correlations (atherogenic indices) of some <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> components with the severity of clinical course and echo-angiographic finding were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It was concluded that the highest correlation with the cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> severity degree existed with the level of apoA1 and apoB <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoproteins</z:chebi>, followed by correlation of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, and the lowest correlation was found between <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> and the total cholesterol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoproteins</z:chebi>, i.e., apoA1/apoB indices are the most sensitive markers of the risk for atherogenesis </plain></SENT>
