<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Determining whether the distribution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes differs between ethnic groups is important in understanding the mechanisms of the increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> incidence in black patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: In this study, 600 black and 600 white patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were prospectively and consecutively recruited to determine differences in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The pathophysiological Trial of Org 10172 (TOAST) classification was used and compared with a clinical (Oxfordshire Community <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Project) subtype classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> subtypes were determined by one investigator by review of original imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Black patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were significantly younger and had higher prevalences of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They were less likely to be smokers and had lower prevalences of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the black patients, 33% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was due to cerebral small vessel disease compared with 14% in the white <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> cohort (odds ratio, 2.94; 95% confidence interval, 1.97 to 4.39; P&lt;0.001, controlling for age, gender, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e>, and social class) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The black <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> cohort had less large vessel <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (odds ratio, 0.49; 95% confidence interval, 0.29 to 0.82; P=0.007) and cardioembolic disease (odds ratio, 0.54; 95% confidence interval, 0.37 to 0.80; P=0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Using a classification based on clinical syndrome alone gave a higher estimate of the frequency of small vessel disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, particularly in white patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A relative excess of small vessel disease was observed in black patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> compared with an excess of extracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in white patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> that was independent of conventional risk factors and social class </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Whether these excesses are due to differences in genetic susceptibility or as-yet undetermined differences in environmental risk remains to be determined </plain></SENT>
