<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Prior to demonstration of occlusions, four patients suffered a mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and three isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo>) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100576'>amaurosis fugax</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients remained alive and with an unchanged functional ability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During follow-up, one patient suffered <z:hpo ids='HP_0100576'>amaurosis fugax</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> followed by a mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, three suffered isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100576'>amaurosis fugax</z:hpo>, two suffered reversible cerebro-<z:mp ids='MP_0006190'>retinal ischemia</z:mp> of more than 24 hours, and one remained symptom free </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In three cases, delayed cerebro-<z:mp ids='MP_0006190'>retinal ischemia</z:mp> distal to one of the occluded ICAs was systematically triggered by orthostatic, cardiogenic or iatrogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo>, and resolved after adequate medical treatment or restoration of a functional collateral circulation by endarterectomy of a tightly stenosed ipsilateral external carotid artery (ECA), suggesting hemodynamic phenomena </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In three cases, micro-emboli originating from a stump or an ulcerated ipsilateral common carotid artery and migrating through well-developed ECA collateral channels explained delayed episodes of ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100576'>amaurosis fugax</z:hpo>, which disappeared in two cases after adequate <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy was introduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Bilateral occlusion of ICA may be a relatively benign condition, if the patients are carefully controlled and treated </plain></SENT>
