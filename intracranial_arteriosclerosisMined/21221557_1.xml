<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Using balloon-expandable stents (<z:chebi fb="114" ids="39041,39043">BES</z:chebi>) for treatment of intracranial stenoses, high inflation pressures and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002063'>rigidity</z:hpo> of the device are regarded as major drawbacks limiting feasibility and safety of the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Self-expanding stents (SES) were developed to facilitate lesion access and to allow for less aggressive <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analyzed data of the INTRASTENT multicentric registry to assess whether self-expanding stents significantly reduced peri-interventional complication rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Records of intracranial stent procedures were entered consecutively into the registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Datasets were divided into two groups according to the type of stent used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For outcome measurement, we chose three categories: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>/minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> [modified Rankin score (mRS) &lt;2], disabling <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and patient <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical outcome was compared between <z:chebi fb="114" ids="39041,39043">BES</z:chebi> and SES </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We analyzed types of adverse events occurring in each group in addition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 409 <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp>, 254 were treated with <z:chebi fb="114" ids="39041,39043">BES</z:chebi> and 155 with SES </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Technical success rates were 97.6% and 98.7%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Adverse event rates were 4.9%, 3.7%, and 0.8% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>/nondisabling <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, disabling <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in the <z:chebi fb="114" ids="39041,39043">BES</z:chebi> group compared with 5.3%, 6.0%, and 4.0% in the SES group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The differences were not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We observed more perforator <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> after use of <z:chebi fb="114" ids="39041,39043">BES</z:chebi>, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> occurred more often in the SES treatment group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Data of the INTRASTENT registry do not support the hypothesis that introduction of SES lowered the overall complication rate of intracranial stent procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>There might be an advantage using self-expanding stents in vessel segments with important perforating arteries </plain></SENT>
