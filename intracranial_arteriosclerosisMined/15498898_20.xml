<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Institutional review board approval was obtained, and informed consent was not required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-eight patients (13 men, 25 women; mean age, 55 years) had undergone cerebral angiography followed by cortical and leptomeningeal biopsy for possible primary <z:mp ids='MP_0001864'>angiitis</z:mp> of the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> during an 8-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Angiography reports were reviewed by investigators blinded to the results of biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Angiographic findings were categorized as typical for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, or other </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fourteen patients had typical angiographic findings of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>None had primary <z:mp ids='MP_0001864'>angiitis</z:mp> of the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> at brain biopsy (60% specificity) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Findings of brain biopsy in the remaining eight patients were nondiagnostic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Repeat angiograms were obtained in three of the eight patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One patient demonstrated interval improvement in multiple focal intracranial arterial stenoses and two demonstrated worsening </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>One of the two patients had slow filling of a single distal cortical artery, and the other patient had multiple regions of abnormally prolonged capillary blush </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In this series, patients suspected of having primary <z:mp ids='MP_0001864'>angiitis</z:mp> of the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> on the basis of clinical and angiographic findings did not have primary <z:mp ids='MP_0001864'>angiitis</z:mp> of the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> at biopsy </plain></SENT>
