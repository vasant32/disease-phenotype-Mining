<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Assessments took place 1 day before and 3 months after CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Only right-handed males were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nineteen patients underwent surgery of the left carotid artery and 17 of the right </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Valid instruments for hemispheric function were included, such as verbal dichotic listening, finger tapping, and a lateralised test for motor planning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results showed that, preoperatively, patients had lower scores compared to norms on the laterality tests, and on a visuoconstructive test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no evidence of ipsilateral improvement related to side of surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Left ear dichotic listening improved, which was seen in both left and right surgery groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Also in both groups, left- and right-hand movement speed in the motor planning test decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conclusion is that beneficial ipsilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1392786" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive change</z:e> after CEA in patients with severe stenosis in one of the carotid arteries may not be demonstrated, even if valid instruments for hemispheric function are included </plain></SENT>
