<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In patients with DNTC, we detected a novel histopathological abnormality that we termed "plaque-like structures" (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PLS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PLS</z:e> appeared as oval, slightly eosinophilic masses of up to 100 microns in diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6824">methenamine</z:chebi> silver stain, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PLS</z:e> were argyrophilic, and thread-like structures were observed in and around them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PLS</z:e> were observed in deep layers of the cortex and subcortical white matter, and were accompanied by small vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They were intimately associated with the small-vessel walls and astrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>They were composed of two types of fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The first type comprised straight and loosely interwoven fibers about 25-30 nm in diameter, while the other type evoked tangles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These structures have not been found in other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegenerative diseases</z:hpo>, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, to evaluate hyaline <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> in DNTC, we examined sclerotic changes of the medullary arteries and assessed white matter lesions in affected patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In three of four patients with DNTC, <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> of the medullary arteries was significantly more extensive than in age-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four patients, the severity of white matter lesions was graded as moderate or severe in the temporal lobe and as mild or moderate in the frontal lobe </plain></SENT>
