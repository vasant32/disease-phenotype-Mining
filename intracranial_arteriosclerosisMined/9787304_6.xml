<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Cross-sectional study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS: A consecutive series of 80 patients (96 plaques) with more than 50% ICA stenosis was studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: B mode ultrasonic images were captured and transferred to a computer on magneto-optic disk and standardised using linear scaling so that adventitia would have a grey scale median (GSM) value of 185-195 and blood 0-5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The GSM and the percentage of echolucent pixels (PEP) in plaques were determined to measure echodensity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Homogeneity, entropy, and contrast were also determined to measure spatial distribution (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo>) of grey shades in each plaque </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Each measurement was correlated to presence or absence of IHS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-five plaques were associated with IHS and 71 plaques were asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In symptomatic plaques the mean of GSM was 23 and the mean of PEP was 70%, compared to 38 and 55% respectively in asymptomatic plaques (p = 0.02; Wilcoxon test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Sixty per cent of symptomatic plaques were associated with a homogeneity, entropy, and contrast values of &gt; 0.2, &lt; 2.95, &lt; 150 respectively as compared to 40% in asymptomatic plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Multiple regression analysis revealed that the GSM and the PEP were the most significant variables (p = 0.001) that are related to presence or absence of IHS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study indicates that computer aided analysis of ultrasonic B mode features of carotid plaques could identify a potentially high-risk subgroup (patients with IHS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A GSM less than 40 or PEP greater than 50% is a good predictor of IHS related to carotid plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The fact that these measurements are operator independent and performed after image standardisation should encourage their use in multicenter clinical trials where different operators and equipment are used </plain></SENT>
