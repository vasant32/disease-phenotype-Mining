<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This flow separation phenomenon is caused by the geometry of the carotid bifurcation and the fluid dynamics of blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated the flow separation phenomenon on lateral-projection intra-arterial digital subtraction angiograms in 99 of 100 carotid bifurcations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean duration of flow separation was 5.8 seconds, with values up to 14 seconds in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> carotid bifurcations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The presence of this flow separation phenomenon is almost independent of <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> and is not correlated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the angiographic finding of a flow separation has no diagnostic value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, our results refer to a factor that may be important in the genesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> at the carotid bifurcation, namely the duration of the stay of blood and its components within the area of flow separation </plain></SENT>
