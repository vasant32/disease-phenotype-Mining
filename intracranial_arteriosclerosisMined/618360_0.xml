<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In a series of examinations of more than 1000 psychiatricneurological patients we tried to state the effects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> on the <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We attempted to diagnose the diabetic metabolic error by means of using the oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test (100 g <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>), the plasma insulin levels and many other laboratory-technical examinations (altogether about 23 000 individual tests) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It was found that 21,6% of the patients had a pathological <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance, 29.6% of them had a pathological insulin response and 5,5% of them showed a known and manifest <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The comparison between the number of patients with a metabolic disturbance and the frequency of sick persons to be expected epidemiologically shows that an influence exercised by the diabetic metabolism may be stated in neurological and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277577" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">psychic disturbances</z:e> of cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001271'>polyneuropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The central syndromes are more frequent than the peripheric ones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mainly low plasma insulin is present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As a rule, pathological results may be seen more often during pathological <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance in electroencephalography, pneumencephalography, CSF-examinations, personality and intelligence states </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This suggests that a diffuse disturbance upon the <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system comes from the diabetic metabolism, without any <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> metabolic disturbance which we did not find among our patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This disturbance is evident clinically as so-called diabetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001271'>polyneuropathy</z:hpo> and also <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In opposition to that very often pathological changes can be seen by technical research methods in other neurological and psychiatric diagnoses without influencing essentially the autonomous progress of the psychiatricneurological illness </plain></SENT>
