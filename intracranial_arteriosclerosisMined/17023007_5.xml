<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The present study examined the effect of high fat and high <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28757">fructose</z:chebi> (HFF) diet on the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and vascular contractile responses in the cerebral artery and thoracic aorta in non-human primates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Female cynomolgus monkeys (age: 3 to 4 years) were divided into <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control diet (N=5) and HFF diet groups (N=5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-eight weeks after feeding the HFF diet, total cholesterol and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol</z:chebi> in serum were significantly increased in the HFF diet group compared to the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The ultrastructural analyses of the basilar artery and aorta demonstrated the infiltration of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-laden <z:hpo ids='HP_0003651'>foam cells</z:hpo> and the appearance of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> droplet-filled smooth muscle cells in the monkeys fed with the HFF diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In terms of vascular reactivity, there was significantly greater vasoconstriction of the aorta and basilar artery in response to 5-hydroxytryptamine in the HFF diet group compared to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> diet-fed group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32588">KCl</z:chebi>-induced vasoconstriction of the basilar arteries was also significantly enhanced in the HFF diet group compared to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> diet-fed monkeys </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, our present study has demonstrated that changes in the vascular responsiveness of the cerebral artery and its cellular architecture may manifest into cerebrovascular complications consistent with a pathological state normally observed with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
