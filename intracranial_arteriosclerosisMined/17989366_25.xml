<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Wingspan is a self-expanding, microcatheter-delivered microstent specifically designed for the treatment of symptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to discuss the effect of patient age and lesion location on in-stent restenosis (ISR) rates after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stenting (PTAS) with the Wingspan system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Clinical and angiographic follow-up results were recorded for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients from 5 participating institutions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ISR was defined as &gt;50% stenosis within or immediately adjacent (within 5 mm) to the implanted stent and &gt;20% absolute <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For the present analysis, patients were stratified into younger (&lt;/=55 years) and older (&gt;55 years) age groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: ISR occurred at a rate of 45.2% (14/31) in the younger group and 24.2% (15/62) in the older group (odds ratio, 2.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-6.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the younger group, ISR occurred after treatment of 13/26 (50%) anterior circulation lesions versus only 1/5 (20%) posterior circulation lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the older group, ISR occurred in 9/29 (31.0%) anterior circulation lesions and 6/33 (18.2%) posterior circulation lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In young patients, internal carotid artery lesions (10/17 treated, 58.8%), especially those involving the supraclinoid segment (8/9, 88.9%), were very prone to ISR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When patients of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ages were considered, supraclinoid segment lesions had much higher rates of both ISR (66.6% versus 24.4%) and symptomatic ISR (40% versus 3.9%) in comparison with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other locations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Post-Wingspan ISR is more common in younger patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This increased risk can be accounted for by a high prevalence of anterior circulation lesions in this population, specifically those affecting the supraclinoid segment, which are much more prone to ISR and symptomatic ISR than <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other lesions </plain></SENT>
