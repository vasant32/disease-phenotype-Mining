<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data for 244 consecutive patients (173 men; mean age 61.6 years) who underwent angioplasty and/or stenting for intracranial atherosclerotic disease at 5 specialized centers were pooled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Baseline, 30-day, and follow-up clinical and angiographic information were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rates of clinical and angiographic endpoints were compared between patients &gt;or=80 years old versus those &lt;80 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients &gt;or=80 years (n = 15) were more likely to be hypertensive (87% versus 69%) and have underlying <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (73% versus 36%, p&lt;0.05) compared to younger patients (n = 229) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The rate of periprocedural <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was 3-fold higher among patients aged &gt;or=80 years compared with those &lt;80 years (20% versus 7%, p = 0.11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (excluding periprocedural events) was observed during follow-up in the octogenarian group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In patients who had follow-up angiography, a similar rate of &gt;or=50% restenosis was observed among patients aged &gt;or=80 years and those aged &lt;80 years (25% versus 29%, p&gt;0.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The 3-fold higher periprocedural <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate suggests cautious use of intracranial angioplasty and/or stent placement in octogenarians </plain></SENT>
