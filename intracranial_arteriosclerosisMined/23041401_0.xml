<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Symptomatic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (ICAS) is a dynamic disease that frequently progresses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">Statins</z:chebi> have been shown to have anti-atherosclerotic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We therefore investigated whether <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> could prevent progression of ICAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This retrospective cohort study assessed 55 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and symptomatic ICAS in the middle cerebral or basilar arteries as shown on magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), with follow-up MRA performed more than 1 year after the index <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Change in ICAS was classified as progressive, regressive, or stable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Baseline clinical characteristics and risk factor control during follow-up were assessed, and laboratory tests were performed at the time of follow-up MRA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> group was defined as patients regularly treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> for more than 75% of the follow-up period; the remaining patients were defined as the non-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At a median follow-up time of 21.8 months (range, 11.8-66.1 months), the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> group consisted of 26 (47.3%) patients and the non-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> group of 29 (52.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During follow-up, 6 (10.9%) patients progressed, 14 (25.5%) regressed, and 35 (63.6%) remained stable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">Statin</z:chebi> treatment was significantly associated with non-progression of ICAS (p=0.024) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two patients in the non-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> group had recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Border-zone <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were associated with progression of ICAS (3/6, 50%; p=0.007), whereas risk factors and inflammatory biomarkers were not related to progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> may prevent progression of symptomatic ICAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Prospective randomized controlled trials are required to confirm that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> protect against such progression </plain></SENT>
