<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A consecutive series of 369 asymptomatic patients with a carotid bruit was prospectively followed with Ocular Pneumoplethysmography (OPG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to identify those patients most prone to cerebrovascular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and/or progression of obstructive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0741975" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During follow-up 13 patients developed a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> of which six were fatal (two thrombo-embolic and four haemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>'s occurred in 15 patients, including eight patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100576'>amaurosis fugax</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>'s occurred more frequently on the side of a haemodynamically significant stenosis (9% = 9/95) than on the side of a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, OPG (2% = 6/274) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in the strokelocated side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of symptoms and/or signs of cerebrovascular disease was 4% at two years and 10% at five years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The left hemisphere was affected twice as often as the right </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The development of a haemodynamically significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo>, according to OPG, was equal for the right and the left carotid arteries, being 18% at two years and 56% after 5 years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The major risk factors for progression of obstructive disease were systolic blood pressure above 160 mmHg independent of age, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and the presence of ischaemic heart and peripheral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003838" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arterial obstructive disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This study supports the contention that in a group of patients with an asymptomatic carotid bruit, a group of patients at risk from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accidents</z:hpo> can be filtered out by a simple non-invasive test in combination with a complete physical examination </plain></SENT>
