<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Percutaneous transluminal angioplastia has in recent years become an alternative to surgery and increasingly used for revascularization of the extracranial arteries in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, intracranial angioplasty is a technique which is still not widely used since it is technically more difficult and until now endoprotheses (stents) have not been available specifically designed for intracranial territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL CASE: A 73 year old patient with extensive extracranial and intracranial atheromatous lesions, multiple vascular risk factors and <z:mp ids='MP_0004120'>cardiac ischemia</z:mp> which contraindicated surgical treatment which was treated consecutively by angioplasty and angioplasty with implantation of stents in both carotid bifurcations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, he was treated by angioplasty for a stenosing lesion of 90% of the right carotid siphon with clinical and hemodynamic repercussions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Following the procedure, which was well-tolerated by the patient, there was clinical and angiographic improvement and return to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> of the hemodynamic parameters measured by transcranial Doppler </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Angioplasty is a technique which may be used in intracranial stenosing atheromatous lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Even without perfect angiographic correction, adequate blood flow is established in the hemodynamically affected lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As far as we know this is the first case of intracranial angioplasty of a lesion of the carotid siphon reported in Spain </plain></SENT>
