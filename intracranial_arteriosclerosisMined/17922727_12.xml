<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND - To evaluate cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers for <z:mp ids='MP_0002229'>neuronal degeneration</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011096'>demyelination</z:hpo> in idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002343'>normal pressure hydrocephalus</z:hpo> (INPH), subcortical arteriosclerotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> (SAE), and neurologically healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS - Lumbar CSF concentrations of sulfatide, neurofilament protein light (NFL), total-tau (T-tau), hyperphosphorylated tau (P-tau), and beta-amyloid(1-42) (Abeta42) were analyzed in 62 INPH patients, 26 SAE patients, and 23 neurologically healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In INPH patients, samples before and after shunt surgery were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS - The CSF concentration of NFL was elevated in INPH and SAE compared with the controls, and levels of T-tau, P-tau, and Abeta42 were lower in INPH compared with SAE and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No difference was seen for sulfatide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> markers except Abeta42 were significantly elevated after shunt surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS - The most striking finding was the power of the combined pattern of NFL, P-tau, and Abeta42 in distinguishing between the clinical diagnoses of INPH, SAE, and neurologically healthy elderly </plain></SENT>
