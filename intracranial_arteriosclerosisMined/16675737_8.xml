<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CX3CR1 has 2 common coding polymorphisms, namely V249I and T280M, that have been associated with interindividual differences in susceptibility to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we investigated the possible association between CX3CR1variants and intima-media thickness (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We genotyped 1256 samples from the Progression of Lesions in the Intima of the Carotid (PLIC) study (a prospective population-based study) for the presence of the V249 and the M280 variants of CX3CR1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Significantly reduced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> was observed in subjects with the MM280 genotype (0.57+/-0.12 mm) compared with subjects with the TT (0.65+/-0.14 mm) or the TM (0.65+/-0.13 mm) genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No difference in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> was observed within carrier of the II249, VI249, or VV249 genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subjects with combined genotype VI249/MM280 and II249/MM280 showed a reduced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The presence of the M280 polymorphism of the fractalkine receptor is associated with a decreased common carotid artery <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>, whereas the presence of the I249 polymorphism does not play a major role on the progression of carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
