<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> may increase the deposition of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100256'>neuritic plaques</z:hpo> or the formation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002185'>neurofibrillary tangles</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, they may simply hasten the age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of disease, or increase the severity of disease symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This investigation examined the association between cerebrovascular disease and the pathologic manifestations of AD in an autopsy series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study using data from the United States National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The primary analysis included 1,054 individuals with clinical information and semiquantitative neuropathologic measurements: 921 had AD as the primary neuropathologic diagnosis and 133 were considered neuropathologically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, 9% of the individuals had clinical history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> during life, but 33% had evidence of cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> at postmortem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0100256'>neuritic plaques</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002185'>neurofibrillary tangles</z:hpo>, the primary neuropathologic manifestations of AD, with either clinical history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or the presence of cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> at postmortem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The authors did find a higher frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100256'>neuritic plaques</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002185'>neurofibrillary tangles</z:hpo> with increased amyloid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">angiopathy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Neither plaques nor tangles were associated with small vessel cerebrovascular disease, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, the presence of large-vessel cerebrovascular disease, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, was strongly associated with an increased frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100256'>neuritic plaques</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Atherosclerotic cerebrovascular disease may have a role in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo>, because of a strong association with frequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0100256'>neuritic plaques</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
