<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Plaque <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> directly correlates with risk of embolism and the recently developed dual-source computed tomography angiography (DSCTA) may help to detect plaques more precisely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to evaluate the prevalence and <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of carotid and cerebrovascular atherosclerotic plaques in patients with symptomatic type 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (DM) by DSCTA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From July 2009 to August 2010, DSCTA was prospectively performed in 125 consecutive patients with symptomatic type 2 DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively analyzed plaque type, distribution, and extensive and obstructive natures were determined for each segment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Atherosclerotic plaques were detected in 114 (91.2%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Relatively more noncalcified (45%) and calcified (39%) plaques and less mixed (16%) plaques were observed (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Noncalcified plaques were found mainly in the intracranial arteries (81.8%), mixed plaques in the intracranial arteries (25.2%) and intracranial internal carotid artery (ICA) (56.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Calcified plaques were found mainly in the intracranial ICA (65.9%) and extracranial arteries (28.2%) (for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Extension of plaques from the 1(st) to 5(th) segments was observed in 67 (58.8%) patients and from the 6(th) to 10(th) segments in 35 (30.7%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The most common site of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> detected plaques was the cavernous segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Regarding stenosis, there were significantly more nonobstructive than obstructive stenosis (91% vs. 9%, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: DSCTA detected a high prevalence of plaques in patients with symptomatic type 2 DM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A relatively high proportion of plaques were noncalcified, as well as with nonobstructive stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The distribution of plaques was extensive, with the cavernous portion of ICA being the most common site </plain></SENT>
