<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> on the aortas were evident in the experimental rabbits of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> plus <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo> group, evidence of early <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> was found on the intracranial small arteries in only three out of the 10 rabbits of this group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Under the microscope widespread thickening and contraction were seen on almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the small cerebral and cerebral parenchymal arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hyaline degeneration could be seen in some of the arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most of the cerebral parenchymal capillary endothelia were swollen and some of these cells contained <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> drops </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of these pathological changes could not be found in the authors earlier experiment in the group of the rabbits without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It was, therefore, surmised that both <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo> would be two of the important factors in inducing the lesions in the cerebral arteries, but although such factors would be coordinative, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> might be more important in the process of damaging the cerebral arteries and leading to their degenerative changes </plain></SENT>
