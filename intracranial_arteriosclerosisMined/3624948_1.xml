<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It was assumed that this property is related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo>, but the basic mechanisms are still unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To investigate further mechanical stimulation experiments were performed with segments of rabbit carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Arteriosclerotic lesions were induced in vivo in these arteries by application of DC impulses either in hyper- or normo- cholesterolemic animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Contractions were evoked by <z:chebi fb="15" ids="33569">noradrenaline</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32588">KCl</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="17" ids="16240">hydrogen peroxide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results show that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the arteriosclerotic segments were hypersensitive to <z:chebi fb="15" ids="33569">noradrenaline</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="17" ids="16240">hydrogen peroxide</z:chebi>, compared with the corresponding controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An increase in contraction force was also found upon application of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32588">KCl</z:chebi> to <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-containing plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, in arteriosclerotic segments obtained from normally fed animals, the contraction response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32588">KCl</z:chebi> was lower than in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This indicates that complex alterations in the contractile properties occur in smooth muscle during atherogenesis which cannot be explained solely on the basis of the influence of cholesterol on the arterial cells </plain></SENT>
