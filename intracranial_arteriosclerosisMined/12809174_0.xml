<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Seventeen normotensive premenopausal women with very high BMI (43.5 +/- 1.6 kg/m2) were recruited for the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Six women were also evaluated 12 months after laparoscopic adjustable <z:chebi fb="144" ids="48140">silicone</z:chebi> gastric banding (LASGB) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Dietary intake, fasting plasma <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile, glycemic and insulinemic response to the OGTT, adrenal secretion, at baseline and after ACTH stimulation test, were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>, common carotid diameter (CD) and left ventricular mass index (LVMi) were measured by B-mode echotomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp> subjects showed higher fasting and stimulated insulin levels, but lower DHEA(S) levels than controls, showing a negative correlation between both fasting and stimulated insulin and DHEA(S), either at baseline or after ACTH testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> was higher (p &lt; 0.05) than controls, with a positive correlation with stimulated insulin (p &lt; 0.05) and a strong negative correlation with DHEA(S) (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In a multiple linear regression analysis, insulin response to OGTT maintained an association with DHEA(S) independent of fasting insulin, while DHEA maintained the association with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> independent of stimulated insulin (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
