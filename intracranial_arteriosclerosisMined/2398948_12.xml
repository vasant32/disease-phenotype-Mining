<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Arteries affected were the vertebral and basilar artery in 6 and 8 patients, the sphenoid course of the middle cerebral artery in 13 cases and the extracranial internal carotid artery in 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 35.7% of cases the so called "dense artery sign" provided earliest evidence of the ensuing infarction documented by CT controls in most patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Angiography carried out in 8 patients, density calculations in the course of the affected vessel and resolution of the increased density on subsequent CT examinations suggest thrombembolism as the most likely etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the clinical setting of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> increased artery density encompassing the entire vessel diameter may serve as an early indicator of major cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and prompt angiographic investigation of a lesion potentially amenable to lysis </plain></SENT>
