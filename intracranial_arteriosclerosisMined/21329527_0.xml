<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Traditional approaches have attempted to target the disease when it is already symptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, early detection of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> may allow therapeutic intervention while the disease is still asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The prevalence and natural history of asymptomatic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in Caucasians remain unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The aims of the Barcelona-ASymptomatic Intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>Atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (ASIA) study are (1) to determine the prevalence of ASIA in a moderate-high vascular risk population, (2) to study its prognostic impact on the risk of suffering future major ischemic events, and (3) to identify predictors of the development, progression and clinical expression of this condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS/DESIGN: Cross-over and cohort, population-based study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A randomly selected representative sample of 1,503 subjects with a mild-moderate-high vascular risk (as defined by a REGICOR score â‰¥ 5%) and with neither a history of cerebrovascular nor <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e> will be studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At baseline, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> individuals will undergo extracranial and transcranial Color-Coded Duplex (TCCD) ultrasound examinations to detect presence and severity of extra and intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Intracranial stenoses will be assessed by magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Clinical and demographic variables will be recorded and blood samples will be drawn to investigate clinical, biological and genetic factors associated with the presence of ASIA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A long-term clinical and sonographic follow-up will be conducted thereafter to identify predictors of disease progression and of incident vascular events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: The Barcelona-ASIA is a population-based study aiming to evaluate the prevalence and clinical importance of asymptomatic intracranial large-artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in Caucasians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The ASIA project may provide a unique scientific resource to better understand the dynamics of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> from its early stages and to identify new potential therapeutic targets for this condition </plain></SENT>
