<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>184 patients who presented with symptoms of hemispheric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> or <z:mp ids='MP_0006190'>retinal ischemia</z:mp>, and had ipsilateral carotid artery atheromatous disease, were clinically followed 5-8 years (mean 6.3 years) after initial presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Based on the findings of the initial duplex ultrasound examination, a comparison was made between those patients who suffered a vascular event in the follow-up period and those who remained alive and without subsequent vascular symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The only significant difference found between the groups was the distribution of the lesion surface characteristics (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The degree of stenosis caused by the lesion or the size of the low-echo pool within the lesion were not found to be significantly associated with subsequent clinical events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results of this study emphasise the importance of the ultrasound evaluation of the carotid lesion surface characteristics, and their inclusion in the criteria for decisions on patient treatment </plain></SENT>
