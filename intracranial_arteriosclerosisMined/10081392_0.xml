<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 35 patients were examined having neurosensory hypoacusis resultant from cerebrovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> insufficiency of cerebral circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> indicated defects of the central parts of the acoustic analyzer in 80% of the examinees </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results of the two methods were similar in 85.7% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The diotic and dichotic alternating speech tests can be used separately and in combination in diagnosis of central acoustic disturbances, of vascular genesis, in particular </plain></SENT>
