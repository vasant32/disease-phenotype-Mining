<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Out of 3435 patients with ischaemic cerebrovascular disease 2540 cases were investigated using cerebral angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 127 of them (5%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were found, but without clinical evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>45 cases were operated upon and 82 were treated conservatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five of these 82 cases (6%) suffered from SAH 3 months to 10 years (mean interval 5.6 years) after the angiographic diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four of these 5 patients with SAH died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among the 45 surgical cases follow-up was uneventful in 29 (64%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The other 16 cases postoperatively showed neurological deterioration (36%), which was transient in 6 but with only minor improvement in 10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of these 10 cases 2 died from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> related to intra-operative temporary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">vascular occlusion</z:e> respectively <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus surgical mortality was 4% and permanent morbidity 18% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Causes of postoperative neurological deterioration were partly related to general arteriosclerotic changes and special fragility of the ischaemic brain, and partly to operative technique (excessive brain retraction, damage to cortical veins, occlusion of major vessels or damage to perforators, temporary <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Apparently in cases with ischaemic cerebrovascular diseases operative procedures, which in other cases as a rule are well tolerated, may produce harmful effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Therefore, in these cases, the indication for operative treatment of so far silent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> should be restricted to patients who are in good general condition with longer life expectancy as far as the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> is concerned, and without major neurological deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the operative technique should be especially gentle and atraumatic </plain></SENT>
