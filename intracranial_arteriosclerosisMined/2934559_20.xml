<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ages ranged from 28 to 82 years (mean, 58 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eighteen bypasses were done with prosthetic grafts, 13 done with autogenous vein, and five were transpositions with primary anastomosis of the subclavian and carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Follow-up was available on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients and ranged from 9 to 156 months (mean, 51.5 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The graft patency rate at 5 years determined by actuarial methods and documented by clinical examination, noninvasive evaluation, and/or arteriography was 94.1% for prosthetic grafts and 58.3% for vein grafts (p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 5-year <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accident</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="46274">CVA</z:chebi>) rate for patients with carotid-subclavian bypass done with prosthetic grafts was 6% in contrast to 39% for those with vein grafts (p less than 0.0545) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> reconstructions done by transposition and primary anastomosis remain patent and there have been no late <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46274">CVAs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that prosthetic grafts are the arterial substitute of choice in carotid-subclavian bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Transposition and primary anastomosis between the carotid and subclavian artery, when technically feasible, may be preferable to the use of free grafts in carotid-subclavian reconstruction </plain></SENT>
