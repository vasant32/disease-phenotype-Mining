<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The first group with cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> at stage 1 included 90 pilots; 20 of them (22%) showed signs of stenotic lesions of the carotid and spinal arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The second group with cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> at stage II-III included 117 subjects; 14 of them exhibited interior carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and 49 stenosis of one or several large vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using clinical data, it was concluded that latent stenosis of cerebral large vessels are frequent in crew-members even at early stages of cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and, therefore, may be risky for flight safety </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ultrasonic Dopplerography, being a fairly simple and accurate technique to detect stenotic vessels, is recommended for large-scale examinations of the flying personnel with cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
