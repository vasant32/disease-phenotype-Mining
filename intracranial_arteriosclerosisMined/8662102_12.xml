<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>rCBF was assessed with single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission tomography using <z:chebi fb="1" ids="33353">technetium</z:chebi>-99m d, l-hexamethylpropylene <z:chebi fb="39" ids="32952">amine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25750">oxime</z:chebi> (99mTc-HMPAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis was performed with multiple linear regression with adjustment for age, sex and ventricle-to-brain ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A significant positive association was found between systolic and diastolic blood pressure and temporo-parietal rCBF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In analysis with quartiles of the distribution, we found a threshold effect for the relation of low diastolic blood pressure (&lt;/=60 mmHg) and low temporo-parietal rCBF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Levels of plasma fibrinogen were inversely related to parietal rCBF, with a threshold effect of high fibrinogen levels (&gt;3.2 g/l) and low rCBF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> was related to low rCBF in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cortical regions, but these associations were not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No consistent relation was observed between severity of cerebral white matter lesions and rCBF </plain></SENT>
