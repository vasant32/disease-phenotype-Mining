<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study considered the relationship between <z:hpo ids='HP_0002059'>cerebral atrophy</z:hpo> and physical signs indicating or promoting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> such as overweight, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>electrocardiographic changes</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, calcification of the internal carotid artery and aorta as well as elongation of the aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study is based on 173 treated and untreated parkinsonian patients (89 men, 84 women) aged from 37--84 years (mean 64.6), on whom CT was performed about 5.4 years after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the first symptoms of the illness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results demonstrate an increase of pathological CT findings as well as of calcification in the carotid siphon with advanced age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No correlation was found between the other items and increasing age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further analysis of the relationship between <z:hpo ids='HP_0002059'>cerebral atrophy</z:hpo> and signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> revealed only a statistically relevant correlation with calcification of the carotid siphon, especially with calcification of the media </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Since pathological CT findings and calcification of the internal carotid artery are both related to advanced age, whereas <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the other items which may be considered to be indications of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> do not have any clear relationship, it is concluded that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002059'>cerebral atrophy</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">Parkinson's disease</z:e> is not caused by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
