<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This time- and effort-saving advantage makes these imaging techniques convenient for determining the structural characteristics of blood vessels in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fibrillar collagen is a well-known element involved in the formation of <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is also an important component of the fibrous cap responsible for structural stability of atherosclerotic plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>High resolution in vivo microscopic imaging and characterization of <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> in animal models can be particularly useful for drug discovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, it is hindered by the limitations of regular microscope objectives to gain access of the tissues of interest and motional artifacts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We report a technique that facilitates in vivo microscopic imaging of carotid arteries of rodents using conventional microscope objectives, and at the same time avoids motional artifacts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As a result, collagen, elastin, leukocytes, cell nuclei, and neutral <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> can be visualized in three dimensions in live animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We present and discuss in vivo imaging results using a flow cessation mouse model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004943'>accelerated atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
