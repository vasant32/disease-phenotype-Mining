<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> vertebrobasilar artery (VBA) occlusion is catastrophic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For embolic occlusion, thrombolysis is reasonable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, if the occlusion is atherosclerotic, the best therapeutic approach remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to characterize the clinical course, case selection, techniques and complications associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> surgical revascularization in atherosclerotic vertebrobasilar occlusion under appropriate patient selection based on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) combined with careful evaluation of progressive neurological symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed nine consecutive patients who were scheduled to undergo <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> surgical revascularization for progressing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in atherosclerotic VBA occlusion consisting of a relatively small DWI lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinical characteristics, radiological findings, results of revascularization, and 3-month outcomes (mRS) were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seven patients underwent surgical revascularization (superficial temporal artery [STA]-superior cerebellar artery [SCA] bypass, n = 5; occipital artery [<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e>]-posterior inferior cerebellar artery [PICA] bypass, n = 1; vertebral endarterectomy, n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Revascularization distal to the occlusion was successful in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> seven patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two patients scheduled for STA-SCA bypass sustained irreversible confluent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brainstem infarction</z:e> before surgical intervention and died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The median time between admission and surgical treatment or irreversible <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> was 20 h (range, 4-72 h) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at 3 months of seven patients who underwent surgical revascularization was good (mRS 0-2) in four patients, poor (mRS 3-6) in three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Mid- to long-term bypass patency was confirmed by magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) in the surviving five patients at a median follow-up of 7 months (range, 1-25 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Atherosclerotic vertebrobasilar artery (VBA) occlusion presented with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038131,C0038506" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Sign or Symptom" abbrv="">stuttering</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms and patients developed worsening symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042568" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vertebrobasilar insufficiency</z:e> over hours to days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>DWI was a useful modality to help guide the appropriate selection of patients for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> surgical revascularization for progressing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in atherosclerotic VBA occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The surgical methods themselves were feasible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Poor outcomes were related to delay of treatment rather than surgical or technical failure </plain></SENT>
