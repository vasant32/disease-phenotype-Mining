<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Pontine hyperintense lesions (PHL) on T2-weighted MRI have been recognized recently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Histopathological findings resemble periventricular leukoaraiosis, and a vascular etiology has been suggested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied the frequency and the associated factors of PHL in patients with symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two independent observers assessed brain MRIs in a prospective cohort of patients with symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only patients in whom both observers scored PHL on T2- and proton density-weighted images, but not on T1-weighted images, were considered to have the lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We studied 229 patients 31% presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, 31% with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, and 38% with peripheral artery disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both observers scored PHL in 23% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with PHL were significantly older and had more lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and periventricular leukoaraiosis than patients without PHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were more women, more hypercholesterolemic and diabetic patients, and more cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> on MRI (P = NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After logistic regression the presence of leukoaraiosis (odds ratio, 2.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.6 to 3.4) and lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (odds ratio, 2.2, 95% confidence interval, 1.5 to 3.1) remained independently associated with PHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>PHL was more common in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo> (39%) than in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarctions</z:hpo> (11%) or peripheral artery disease (19%) (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We found that PHL on T2- and proton density-weighted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images are often found in patients with symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The association with periventricular leukoaraiosis and lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> suggests that PHL is a variant of leukoaraiosis, with possibly the same pathophysiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The clinical symptoms and consequences of PHL, however, are not yet clear </plain></SENT>
