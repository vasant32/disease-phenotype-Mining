<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Stenting of symptomatic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> remains under investigation, yet this option to potentially avert subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> has been offered at select centers under humanitarian device exemption and off-label use for several years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Retrospective case series of consecutive patients undergoing stenting with Wingspan and balloon mounted coronary stents for symptomatic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> at a single institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recurrent symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in the territory of the stented artery was ascertained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rates of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> were calculated per patient-year of follow-up and were compared with medically treated patients in the <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">Warfarin</z:chebi>-Aspirin Symptomatic Intracranial Disease (WASID) trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the 10 year study period, 41 cases of intracranial stenting were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Stenoses were severe (&gt;70%) in 88% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Stenting procedures occurred a median of 14 days from the most recent symptomatic event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>19 Wingspan stents and 22 balloon mounted coronary stents were deployed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Four <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> occurred within 24 h of stenting, seven within 1 month and eight within 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>By 3 months after stenting, no further <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> occurred during up to 2 years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients had 0.194 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo> per person-year of follow-up, compared with 0.083 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo> per person-year of follow-up in the aspirin arm of WASID and 0.065 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo> per person-year of follow-up in the <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> arm of WASID </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Stenting of symptomatic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in a high risk subset of cases with advanced degree of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> stenosis may be associated with an increased early risk of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
