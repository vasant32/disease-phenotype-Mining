<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The indication for angiography differed, but was aimed at clarifying suspected cerebrovascular events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>578 patients could be followed-up after a median time of 10.4 years (0-22) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median survival time after angiography was 9.7 years for the 355 men and 12.8 years for the 223 women (p = 0.0099) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Internal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> of &gt; 50% was seen in 9.0% (bilaterally in 2.2%), a stenosis &gt; 75% in 4.5% (bilaterally in 0.9%) and occlusion in 9% (bilaterally in 0.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ulceration was present in 10.7% (bilaterally in 1.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>26.5% of the patients had a cerebrovascular event during follow-up, of which 31.4% had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tia|TIA|T.I.A.">transient ischaemic attack</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0100576'>amaurosis fugax</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Survival was not influenced by the degree of stenosis, but presence of arteriosclerotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery disease</z:e> significantly reduced the median survival time from 11 to 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The main cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> for men was <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (27.7%) and for women a cerebrovascular event (27.8%), a significant difference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>From this study, in selected patients it can be concluded that the annual frequency of cerebrovascular events was low, approaching frequencies reported in asymptomatic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> differed between men and women, with more cardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> among men and more cerebrovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> among women </plain></SENT>
