<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In multiple logistic regression analyses, male gender (odds ratio and 95% confidence interval: 1.52 [1.39-1.67]) and increased total (1.47 [1.32-1.63]) and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> (1.49 [1.34-1.65]) levels were statistically significantly associated only with the presence of plaque </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contradistinction, smoking (2.22 [1.79-2.75]) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (1.54 [1.30-1.82]) were additionally associated with acoustic shadowing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011899'>Hyperfibrinogenemia</z:hpo> (1.33 [1.12-1.59]) was associated only with lesions accompanied by acoustic shadowing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>While ethnicity associations with plaque alone varied across the artery segments, among those with plaque, being white was uniformly associated with acoustic shadowing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After multivariable adjustment, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> was not associated with either manifestation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, differences were seen in the associations of established <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> with discretely characterized carotid artery plaque lesions, according to the presence or absence of acoustic shadowing suggestive of mineralization of plaque </plain></SENT>
