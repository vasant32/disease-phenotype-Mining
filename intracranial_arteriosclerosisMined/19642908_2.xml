<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The mechanism of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> in the vascular wall in atherothrombosis and during the progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> has attracted attention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We focused on the potential usefulness of inflammatory markers in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>, and analyzed the role of inflammatory markers in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> of the intracranial artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The subjects were 2 groups of patients treated between 2004 and 2006: a group of outpatients with recurrent infarction (group RI), who developed atherothrombotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> twice; another group of outpatients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> without recurrence (group BI), who developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> once and remained free of recurrence for &gt;1 year; and a group of control subjects with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) (group C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Plasma samples were collected from each group of patients for the simultaneous measurement of 17 kinds of candidate inflammatory markers, using a fluorescent microbead array system, and the results were compared with head MRA findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1) were significantly higher in group RI patients than in groups C and BI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subjects with a hsCRP level &gt; or =0.3 and a <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 level &gt; or =200 in the serum have, respectively, a 1.92 and 2.98 relative risk to have a potential recurrent infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Regarding the relation of inflammatory marker levels with MRA findings, group RI showed significantly higher levels of hsCRP at M1 lesions and <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 at A1 and M1 lesions than group BI (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 level as well as hsCRP in the blood can be a potential predictive marker of recurrent thrombotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>, and may reflect <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> that promotes intracranial large-artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
