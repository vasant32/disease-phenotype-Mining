<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: To date, 81 mutations of ATP-binding cassette transporter 1 (ABCA1) have been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, no ABCA1 mutation has been reported in the Chinese population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used direct sequencing to screen for ABCA1 mutations in 72 patients with both atherosclerotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> (ACI) and plasma <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi>) &lt; 0.8 mmol/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The functionality of the mutation was verified using 200 unrelated controls and 76 patients with ACI and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> by PCR-RFLP analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> prior to ACI was found to carry the heterozygous Y2206D mutation, which has not been reported previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patient had a medical history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in the coronary and carotid arteries going back 40 years and splenohepatomegalia for 13 years, with a low plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> level (0.66 mmol/l) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> A1 level (0.61 mmol/l) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During the past decade, he had developed symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sixteen months prior to the study, he was admitted to hospital for an ACI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results suggest that this patient is most likely a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1704429" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="FHA|HDLC|HDLD">familial hypoalphalipoproteinemia</z:e> and that the Y2206D mutation may be associated with not only a lower level of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi>, but also with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
