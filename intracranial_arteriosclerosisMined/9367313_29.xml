<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To review our experience with intracranial angioplasty, including the complications we encountered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: During a 3-year period, from 1993 to 1996, 10 patients had intracranial percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (<z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The stenosed vessels included three internal carotid arteries, one middle cerebral artery, one basilar artery, and five vertebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Stenosis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients was 75%, or greater </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> was technically successful in eight patients; in two patients it could not be performed owing to inability to traverse the stenosed area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two patients had successful and uneventful <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five patients had vasospasm, which resolved with local <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilators</z:chebi> in two and with repeat <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Vasospasm led to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compromise of perforating vessels and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005294'>arterial dissection</z:hpo> were associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Intracranial <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> is technically feasible but associated with risks related to vasospasm, arterial trauma, and compromise of perforating vessels </plain></SENT>
