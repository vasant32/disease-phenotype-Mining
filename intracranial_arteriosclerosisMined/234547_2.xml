<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They are characterized by their ability to transport particles too large for the small holes of the internal elastic lamina locating underneath the endothelial cells, such as carbon particles with the similar size of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>, floating beta-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi>, Lp(a) and especially of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39027">VLDL</z:chebi>, into the subendothelial space from the blood stream by their abnormally strong contracting and phagocytosis-like activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Large particles such as carbon particles with a size of 200 to 700 angstrom are too large to penetrate further through holes of the internal elastic lamina from the subendothelial space to muscular layers of the arterial wall, resulting in stagnating for a long time in the subendothelial space, thus showing the atherogenic property of the hyperreactive arterial endothelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Such endothelial cells appear spotty and streaky in the localized endothelial lining of predominantly susceptible parts to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in susceptible animal species such as rabbit, chicken, and rhesus monkey especially densely in their atheromatous lesions, but do not generally appear in non-susceptible animals to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> like rate and dog </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They are extremely few in infant rabbit, but increase by age.They appear in hypertensive rat, showing a characteristic distribution even in small groups of arteriessuch as the circle of Willis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cyclic <z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi>, and especially <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50095">dibutyryl cyclic AMP</z:chebi>, exhibited an inhibitory effect on the hyperreactivity of those cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cyclic <z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50218">phosphodiesterase inhibitors</z:chebi>, EG467 and eg626, exhibited a powerful inhibitory effect on the contracting and phagocytosis-like activity of those cells, as in the case of pyridinolcarbamate, which enhances enzymes to produce ATP and inhibits slightly cyclic <z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi> phosphodiesterase, although its inhibitory effect on cyclic <z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi> phosphodiesterase is weaker than that of EF467 and EG626 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The usefulness of the inhibitors on cyclic <z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi> phospodiesterase of arterial endothelial cells and platelets and on that of brain, such as EG467 AND EG626, has been suggested in the treatment of atherosclerotic disorders, especially of cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Some of the hitherto desperate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306341" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">mental disability</z:e> of the aged seem to be a promising target for treatment with cyclic <z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50218">phosphodiesterase inhibitors</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
