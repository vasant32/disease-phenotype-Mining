<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-seven patients with major <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> (mean age = 52.8 years, SD = 12.6) and 21 healthy volunteers (mean age = 54.7 years, SD = 9.1) underwent high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging scanning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>T2-weighted films were scored for deep white matter (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DWM</z:e>), periventricular (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e>), and subcortical (SC) hyperintensities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no difference in lesion severity between patients and control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After controlling for age, <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17439">vitamin B12</z:chebi> levels were predictive of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DWM</z:e> lesions in patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DWM</z:e> and SC lesions were associated with histories of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: A relatively small sample of patients were recruited from specialist services and the findings may not represent those observed in larger or community-based cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with major <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17439">vitamin B12</z:chebi> levels and histories of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and/or <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are predictive of white matter lesions </plain></SENT>
