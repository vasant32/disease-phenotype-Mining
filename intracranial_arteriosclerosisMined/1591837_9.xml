<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Different patterns of risk factors might be related to the involvement of specific vascular districts by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this sense, many investigations have addressed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo>, whereas extracoronary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> has received less extensive attention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Vascular risk factors, with particular attention to <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> parameters (total cholesterol [TC]; <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>; <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi>], HDL2 and HDL3 cholesterol [HDL2-C, HDL3-C]), were evaluated by means of univariate and multivariate (discriminant) analysis in a group of 169 patients (128 men and 41 women; mean ages, 58 +/- 7 and 62 +/- 7 years, respectively) with clinically and angiographically demonstrated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> of the supra-aortic trunk and/or lower limbs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> were excluded from this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The control group consisted of 140 age- and sex-matched individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By univariate analysis, smoking was more closely associated with peripheral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, whereas blood pressure was higher in patients with supra-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003493" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Unrecognized <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> was a frequent finding in patients with peripheral disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The percentage of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemias</z:hpo> was fourfold higher in patients than in control subjects, with differences consisting of higher <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> and lower <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi>, HDL2-C, and HDL3-C concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>By discriminant analysis, high correct classification (CC) rates were achieved in the various patient subgroups on the basis of variables selected from the statistical function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In male patients with peripheral disease, the variables <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi>, smoking, diastolic blood pressure, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, in that order, yielded a CC in 90.4% of the cases; in female patients, smoking, TC/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi>, and body mass index gave a CC rate of 95.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In men with cerebral disease, the selected variables TC/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi>, diastolic blood pressure, and TC yielded a CC of 90.7%; in women, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi>, TC/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi>, and fibrinogen levels produced a CC rate of 89.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Risk profiles in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> of the supra-aortic trunks and lower limbs seem to differ in relation to gender and circulatory district involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The importance of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> parameters, in particular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi>, HDL2-C, and TC/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi>, as extracoronary risk factors is further confirmed </plain></SENT>
