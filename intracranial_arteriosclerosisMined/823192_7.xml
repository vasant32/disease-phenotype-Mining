<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Qualitative and quantitative comparisons of improvement in symptoms showed that Hydergine consistently produced statistically significant (p less than or equal to 0.05) improvement in 13 symptoms associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, because of the small magnitude of the improvement and the absence of indications of long-term benefit, Hydergine would seem to be of minor value in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Further research with better methodology and design might lead to a different conclusion </plain></SENT>
