<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To conduct a prospective multicenter study to evaluate the natural history of ICAS and, in those patients refractory to medical treatment, the outcomes associated with intracranial angioplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients aged 18 to 80 were enrolled with symptoms attributed to a single ICAS of &gt; or =50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Optimal medical therapy of vascular risk factors and preventive antithrombotic therapy were at the discretion of the local investigator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were eligible for intracranial angioplasty after experiencing recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> despite medical therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neurologic and ultrasonographic examinations were performed at study inclusion, 3 months after enrollment, and every 6 months of follow-up thereafter, for 36 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred two patients were included, with a mean age of 63.3 +/- 10.4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Intracranial artery stenoses involved the vertebral artery in 22.5%, the basilar artery in 25.5%, the middle cerebral artery in 26.5%, and the internal carotid artery in 25.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 27.4% of the patients, the stenoses had clinical hemodynamic characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>During a mean follow-up of 23.4 months, 38.2% of the patients had a cerebrovascular event: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in 13.7% and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> in 24.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Among patients with a hemodynamically significant stenosis, 60.7% had a recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> in the territory of the stenotic artery; this association was significant in univariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Twenty-eight patients underwent an endovascular procedure with a neurologic periprocedural complication rate of 14.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The overall vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate was 8.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Despite medical treatment, the 2-year recurrence rate of ischemic events in the territory of the stenotic artery was 38.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Cardiovascular events occurred in 18.6% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Clinically significant hemodynamic stenoses were associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrence and may help identify a high risk subset of patients </plain></SENT>
