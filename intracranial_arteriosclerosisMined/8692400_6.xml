<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The existence of intracranial vasa vasorum supplying the larger vessels of the circle of Willis has long been debated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Much of this debate results from contradictory findings of microanatomic studies in a variety of nonprimate species </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, however, a growing body of evidence seems to suggest that in certain pathological situations, such as human intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, vasa vasorum are present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In an effort to determine whether intracranial vasa vasorum are present in humans without clinical evidence of intracranial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e>, we studied the circle of Willis in five autopsy specimens using immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Antiserum to the endothelial-specific antigen, Factor VIII, revealed staining of 10- to 20-microns vascular channels in the outer media and adventitial layers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Staining was present in the proximal carotid, middle cerebral (M1), and anterior cerebral (A1) arteries but could not be detected in M2 or A2 segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">Hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin staining was additionally helpful in identifying the nuclear <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of the endothelial cells lining these channels, as well as the presence of erythrocytes within them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that in nonpathological settings, endothelial-lined channels exist in the proximal intracranial vessels of humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These vessels might represent intracranial vasa vasorum, which in turn might play a role in pathological conditions, such as atheroma formation, intracranial dissection, and vasospasm </plain></SENT>
