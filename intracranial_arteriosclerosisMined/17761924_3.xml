<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Participants in the Jackson cohort of the Atherosclerotic Risk in Communities study have had extensive baseline evaluations, have undergone echocardiography during the third examination (1993-1995), and have been followed up for incident <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The study population consisted of 1792 participants, of whom 639 (35.7%) were men and the mean+/-SD age was 58.8+/-5.7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Compared with those without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> had a higher frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (85.6% vs 58.7%) and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (46.9% vs 21.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001712'>Left ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo> was more prevalent in those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (62.2% vs 38.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During a median follow-up of 8.8 years, 98 incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> occurred (6.5 per 1000 person-years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>LVMI was independently associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> after adjusting for age, sex, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, systolic blood pressure, smoking, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, total to <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> ratio, body mass index, and low left ventricular ejection fraction (adjusted hazard ratio per 10 g/m(2.7) increment of LVMI=1.15; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.28) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The relation remained statistically significant after adding left atrial size and mitral annular calcification to the multivariable model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this large, population-based African American cohort, we found that echocardiographic LVMI was an independent predictor of incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> even after taking into account traditional clinical risk factors </plain></SENT>
