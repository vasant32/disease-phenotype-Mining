<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (ICAS) is a major cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>; however it is rather neglected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Vessel wall visualization by high resolution magnetic resonance imaging (HRMRI) might provide more accurate information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 219 consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> underwent MRI, MRA and proton-density weighted HRMRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using HRMRI, the patients were divided into 3 groups with respect to basilar plaques: no plaque (n = 85), minimal plaque (n = 72) and apparent plaque (n = 62) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Demographics and characteristics were compared between the groups, and the extents of stenoses calculated from MRA versus HRMRI data were also compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Factors potentially associated with basilar plaque were validated by multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with apparent plaque had higher frequencies of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, lower <z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">high-density lipoprotein</z:chebi> and higher <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the 62 cases of apparent plaque, severe stenosis (&gt;50%) was observed in 10 (16%) by MRA and in 27 (43%) by HRMRI, which points to overestimation of plaques by HRMRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, no stenosis was evident on MRA in 13 patients with apparent plaque even though they had up to 72% stenosis on HRMRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for covariates, basilar artery apparent plaque was independently associated with old age, previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, low <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> and high levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> with plaque is more accurately detected using HRMRI than MRA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In addition, the associated risk factors differ somewhat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The use of HRMRI for evaluating ICAS deserves more attention </plain></SENT>
