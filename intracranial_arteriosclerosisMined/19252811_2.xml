<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> on WML progression by performing a post hoc analysis on the ROCAS (Regression of Cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>Artery Stenosis</z:mp>) study, which is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> upon asymptomatic middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> progression among <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-free individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two hundreds and eight randomized subjects were assigned to either placebo (n = 102) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> 20 mg daily (n = 106) for 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Baseline severity of WML was graded visually into none, mild, and severe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Volume (cm3) of WML was determined quantitatively at baseline and at end of study using a semi-automated method based on MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Primary outcome was the change in WML volume over 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After 2 years of follow-up, there was no significant change in WML volume between the active and the placebo group as a whole </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, stratified analysis showed that for those with severe WML at baseline, the median volume increase in the active group (1.9 cm3) was less compared with that in the placebo group (3.0 cm3; P = 0.047) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Linear multivariate regression analysis identified that baseline WML volume (beta = 0.63, P &lt; 0.001) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9150">simvastatin</z:chebi> treatment (beta = -0.214, P = 0.043) independently predicted change in WML volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> may delay the progression of cerebral WML only among those who already have severe WML at baseline </plain></SENT>
