<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Angiographically <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of them showed occlusive disease of the cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two patients had lesions in different cerebral arteries, but showed signs and symptoms of insufficiency of the carotid artery contralateral to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100660'>dyskinesias</z:hpo>, which was occluded in one patient and severely stenosed in the other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The third patient had frank occlusion of the basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The blood supply of the nucleus subthalamicus receiving contributions from the carotid and vertebral arterial system as well would explain transient hemiballism as a symptom of the insufficiency of both arterial systems and would further be one of the possible explanations for the low frequency of this symptom </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the other hand the appearance of transient hemiballism should be regarded as indicative of significant occlusive disease of the cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
