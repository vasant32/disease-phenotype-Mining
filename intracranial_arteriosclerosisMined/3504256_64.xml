<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Their gaits had elements of both <z:hpo ids='HP_0001300'>Parkinsonism</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo>, which were most marked in 4 patients unable to stand unaided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The difficulty in using their legs to walk was out of proportion to that of other movements of the lower limbs when lying or seated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, upper limb mobility and facial expression were relatively preserved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Attention is drawn to the similarity of this gait pattern to that of some patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo>, frontal lobe lesions, and "senile" disorders of gait </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A possible mechanism for this Parkinsonian-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> in these various conditions may be their propensity to damage the afferent and efferent interconnections of the leg areas of the motor and supplementary motor areas of the cerebral cortex with, the cerebellum and basal ganglia </plain></SENT>
