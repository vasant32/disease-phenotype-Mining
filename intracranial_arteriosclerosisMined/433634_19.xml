<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mortality in men declined from 361 per 10,000 before 1950 to 252 per 10,000 in 1969--74 and in women from 324 per 10,000 to 215 per 10,000 during the same periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the organic and symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033975" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">psychoses</z:e> (mainly senile and arteriosclerotic) mortality ranged from six to ten times that of the general population, whereas in the non-organic (functional) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033975" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">psychoses</z:e> mortality was only twice as high as in the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This discrepancy in mortality between organic and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0349204" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">non-organic psychoses</z:e>, which is caused by the somatic disorders with high <z:mp ids='MP_0010769'>lethality</z:mp> underlying the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0520473" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">organic psychoses</z:e>, suggests that mortality should be calculated separately for organic and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0349204" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">non-organic psychoses</z:e>, which is sometimes neglected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An increasing number of hospital admissions with organic, mainly senile, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033975" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">psychoses</z:e> is to be expected in the future, as well as an increasing proportion of non-organic patients with slight <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0033975,C0459435" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction;Finding" abbrv="">psychotic</z:e> symptoms and a low and possibly decreasing mortality. between 1950 and 1974 radical changes took place in the psychiatric hospitals which could have influenced mortality </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A significant rise in unnatural <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0812393,C0038661" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction;Injury or Poisoning" abbrv="">suicides</z:e> and accidents) has been observed particularly since 1963 </plain></SENT>
