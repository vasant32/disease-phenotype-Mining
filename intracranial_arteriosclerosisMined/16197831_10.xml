<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Patients with intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> who fail antithrombotic therapy have a poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The high rate of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> warrants testing alternative treatments such as intracranial angioplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We present our experience in the treatment of 104 patients (age range, 54-82 years; mean age, 67 years) with symptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic stenoses despite medical therapy who underwent stent-assisted angioplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patient records were retrospectively analysed for location and degree of stenosis, regimen of antiplatelet agents, devices used, procedure-related complications and adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical (Modified Rankin Scale) and radiographic outcomes were obtained 24 hours, 1 month and 3-6 months after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sixty-five lesions (62.5%) were located in the posterior circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean stenosis was 75.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, the angiographic degree of stenosis was reduced to less than 30% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One stent was implanted in 66 patients (63%), and two or more in 38 patients (37%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Modified Rankin Scale (mR) was 1-2 in 67.5% of the cases, 3-4 in 25.9%, 5 in 2.8%, 6 in 3.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Procedural morbidity was 5.7% and procedural mortality was 3.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Angiographic follow-up was available in 58 patients (55.7%) and the restenosis rate was 12.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: In selected patients, endovascular revascularization of intracranial arteries by means of stent-assisted angioplasty is technically feasible, effective and safe </plain></SENT>
