<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: High levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) are associated with an increased risk of further ischemic events in patients with symptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic disease (ICAD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It remains unknown to which extent this increased risk might be genetically predetermined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to investigate the relationship between a common genetic polymorphism of the CRP gene and the risk of recurrent ischemic events in symptomatic ICAD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 75 consecutive patients with a first-ever cerebral ischemic event attributable to symptomatic ICAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Blood samples were drawn 3 months after the qualifying event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Genomic DNA was isolated and the C1444T single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of the CRP gene was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The blood concentration of CRP was also measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients underwent long-term clinical follow-up to detect the occurrence of further major ischemic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During a median follow-up time of 23 months, 18 patients (24%) suffered a major ischemic event (10 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo>, 3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> and 5 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarctions</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Raised CRP levels at baseline (p = 0.02) and the presence of the T allele within the CRP C1444T SNP were associated with a higher risk of recurrent ischemic events (p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier and multivariable Cox regression analyses adjusted for age, sex, vascular risk factors and CRP level identified that the presence of the T allele in the studied polymorphism predicted the occurrence of further ischemic events (hazard ratio 3.6, 95% confidence interval 1.2-11.1; p = 0.025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The presence of the T allele within the CRP gene C1444T polymorphism may be associated with a higher risk of further ischemic events in symptomatic ICAD patients </plain></SENT>
