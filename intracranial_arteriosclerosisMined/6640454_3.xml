<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The data obtained from 246 carotid Doppler examinations were compared with the angiographic findings in the same patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were high when the degree of stenosis was greater than 50%, but occlusions were less reliably detected, with 8 (33%) of the 24 being misdiagnosed as high-grade stenoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Carotid Doppler evaluation guides and accelerates decisions regarding further investigations, such as cerebral angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It helps one decide whether a neck bruit is of arterial origin and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">aids</z:e> assessment following cerebrovascular surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is not a substitute for cerebral angiography because it poorly visualizes both the posterior and the intracranial circulations and cannot accurately detect low-grade (less than 50%) stenoses or ulcerated arterial plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Detection of stenosis in a carotid artery in an otherwise uncertain case is an indication for cerebral angiography, so the Doppler technique will probably increase the number of angiograms performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, this technique is also useful in follow-up, being without hazard, and should, therefore, reduce the likelihood of unnecessary angiographic examinations </plain></SENT>
