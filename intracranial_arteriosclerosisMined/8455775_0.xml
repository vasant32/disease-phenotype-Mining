<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Trapping of the involved middle cerebral artery segment allowed direct exposure for excision of the atheromatous plaque and subsequent closure of the arteriotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Intraoperative angiography confirmed the reestablishment of flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient made an uneventful postoperative recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Direct middle cerebral artery endarterectomy has the advantage of potentially reestablishing flow to lenticulostriate branches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The technique may also avoid the problem of occlusion at the site of maximum stenosis that can be caused by the use of an extra/intracranial bypass graft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Middle cerebral artery endarterectomy is a potentially valuable technique that deserves further investigation </plain></SENT>
