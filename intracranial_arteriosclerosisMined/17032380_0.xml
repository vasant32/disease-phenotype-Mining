<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been widely applied in detecting intracranial large <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp>, but there have been few validation studies to compare with histopathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the postmortem study is to assess the accuracy of MRI in identifying middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We recruited, consecutively, Chinese postmortem autopsies in our hospital during 19 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MRI was performed in the postmortem brains to scan the cross-sections of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCAs</z:chebi> with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32594,32595">barium</z:chebi> expanding the artery lumen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCAs</z:chebi> were then removed for histopathologic studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With histopathology as a reference standard, the accuracy of MRI was evaluated, and the correlation between <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis identified by MRI and radiologically or histopathologically evident brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventy-six consecutive autopsies were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity and specificity of MRI in detecting more than 30% <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis were 38.6% and 92.2%, with a positive predictive value of 87.2% and negative predictive value of 52.2%, and the corresponding values of MRI in identifying more than 50% <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis were 57.1%, 90.8%, 50%, and 83.0%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both more than 30% and more than 50% <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis identified by MRI were found to be associated with infarctions in the corresponding <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory (P= 0.001, odds ratio = 4.365, 95% CI: 1.684-11.313; and P= 0.039, odds ratio = 2.694, 95% CI: 1.139-6.377) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates the agreement between ex vivo MRI and histopathology in identifying <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis, and the correlation between the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis identified by MRI and radiologically or histopathologically evident brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
