<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 68 consecutive cases with symptomatic IAS, diagnosed by imaging, were enrolled in this prospective and randomized study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received standard medical management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients in the BAIPC group (n = 38) underwent 5 brief cycles consisting of bilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0340563" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">upper limb ischemia</z:e> followed by reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The BAIPC procedure was performed twice daily over 300 consecutive days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Incidence of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and cerebral perfusion status in BAIPC-treated patients were compared with the untreated control group (n = 30) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the control group, incidence of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> at 90 and 300 days were 23.3% and 26.7%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the BAIPC group, incidence of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was reduced to 5% and 7.9% at 90 and 300 days (p &lt; 0.01), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The average time to recovery (modified Rankin Scale score 0-1) was also shortened by BAIPC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cerebral perfusion status, measured by SPECT and transcranial Doppler sonography, improved remarkably in BAIPC-treated brain than in control (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study provides a proof-of-concept that BAIPC may be an effective way to improve cerebral perfusion and reduce recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> in patients with IAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further investigation of this therapeutic approach is warranted as some patients were excluded after randomization </plain></SENT>
