<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We assessed the safety, tolerability, and pharmacodynamics of lotrafiban, an oral platelet <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> IIb/IIIa inhibitor, as a secondary prevention strategy in patients with cerebrovascular or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Overall, 451 patients with a recent cardiovascular or cerebrovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischemic event were randomized in a double-blind fashion to 1 of 5 dosing regimens for 12 weeks: placebo or 5, 20, 50, or 100 mg lotrafiban, both twice daily with 300 to 325 mg/d aspirin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary end point was the incidence and tolerability of major and minor <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> during treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Secondary end points included inhibition of platelet aggregation and clinical events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The placebo and lotrafiban 5-mg groups had similarly low rates of minor and major <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, but the 100-mg arm was terminated early because of excess major <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Protocol-defined <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> (&lt;100 000 platelets/microL) occurred in 5 lotrafiban-treated patients (1.4%, 95% CI 0.2% to 2.7%) and 1 placebo patient (1.1%, 95% CI 0% to 3.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three lotrafiban-treated patients had a nadir platelet count &lt;20 000/microL (0.9%, 95% CI 0% to 1.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Lotrafiban produced dose-dependent inhibition of platelet aggregation; 5 mg lotrafiban did not differ significantly from placebo, whereas 100 mg inhibited aggregation by nearly 100% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS:-Lotrafiban provides dose-dependent platelet inhibition when administered to a range of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The level of platelet inhibition appears to correlate with <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> risk and drug tolerability </plain></SENT>
