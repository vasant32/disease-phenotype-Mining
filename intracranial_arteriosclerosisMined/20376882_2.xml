<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Koreans have been undergoing rapid lifestyle changes that may have an effect on patterns of <z:hpo ids='HP_0007201'>cerebral artery atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was aimed at determining the frequency and distribution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in the cerebral arteries and associated temporal changes over the past eight-year period among Korean <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: By using <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> registry data registered between April 1999 and March 2007, we investigated the presence, severity, and location of <z:hpo ids='HP_0007201'>cerebral artery atherosclerosis</z:hpo> as determined by angiographic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Their annual patterns and association with vascular risk factors were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 1,955 patients, 1,517 patients (77.6%) demonstrated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in one or more arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A significantly increasing trend of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> was observed during the past eight years, which was ascribed to an increase of combined extracranial (EC) and intracranial (IC) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The number of atherosclerotic arteries increased as the number of risk factors increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the multivariate analysis, the year and vascular risk factors were independent predictors of the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We found that the atherosclerotic burden has been increasing for the past eight years in Korean <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients, particularly the combined EC and IC subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Lifestyle changes and increase in vascular risk factors may be contributing factors </plain></SENT>
