<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> is a highly morbid disease; however, techniques for revascularization are still in evolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors comprise a multidisciplinary team of neurologists, neuroradiologists, and interventional cardiologists who have collaborated in treating fifteen patients with symptomatic intracranial stenosis who have failed medical therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> success rate (100%) and one-year freedom from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (93.4%) using balloon angioplasty and provisional stenting are encouraging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A surprising observation in this patient cohort was that 53% of patients had improvement or resolution of a deficit that was <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> and presumed to be permanent and irreversible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> but reversible deficit is termed "brain <z:mp ids='MP_0006112'>angina</z:mp>" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The background, rationale for a multidisciplinary team, techniques, and preliminary results of intracranial angioplasty with provisional stenting are presented </plain></SENT>
