<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> at extracranial carotid and intracranial arteries in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IHD</z:e>) is not well defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We carried out a 5-year longitudinal study with magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IHD</z:e> to assess the incidence of progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> at extracranial carotid and intracranial arteries and to determine predictors of the progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We previously performed carotid and intracranial MRA on 67 patients who had received selective coronary angiography for the clinical diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IHD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of these 67 subjects, 41 patients gave informed consent to undergo MRA reexaminations to evaluate changes of extra- and intracranial arteries over a 5-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The degree of stenosis was divided into five grades depending on the narrowness of the arteries, i.e. <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, mild, moderate, severe and occluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The average of follow-up period with MRA examination was 58.8 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, as defined as an increase of one grade of the stenosis rating, including both the exacerbation of pre-existing stenosis and the appearance of new stenotic lesions, were found in five patients (12.2%) for the cervical carotid artery and in only one patient (2.4%) for the intracranial artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that baseline carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> (P = 0.008), age (P = 0.047), and coronary events during the follow-up period (P = 0.048) were significant and independent predictors of progression of carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our findings suggest that follow-up evaluation of the carotid artery is indicated for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IHD</z:e> in whom carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> was detected on an initial examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further study is needed with larger numbers of patients to confirm these findings </plain></SENT>
