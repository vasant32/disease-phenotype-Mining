<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> presented gross disorders in the function of carboanhydrase and gaseous metabolism from the first day of the disease which was expressed in an increased oxygenation of the venous blood and <z:mp ids='MP_0003032'>hypocapnia</z:mp>, whose severity was correlated with the gravity of the disease course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors have established an important pathogenetic role in gaseous metabolism impairment of erythrocyte carboanhydrase, whose activity in the capillary bed in <z:mp ids='MP_0003032'>hypocapnia</z:mp> was drastically inhibited, compromising, therefore, the entry of carbon dioxide into erythrocytes, which deteriorated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> dissociation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The authors consider the possibility of normalizing gaseous metabolism in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients via eliminating <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> deficit in tissues </plain></SENT>
