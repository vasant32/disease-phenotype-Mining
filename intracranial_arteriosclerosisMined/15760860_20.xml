<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was undertaken to assess the efficacy and long-term clinical outcome of angioplasty without stent placement for patients with symptomatic intracranial stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective study was done to evaluate 36 patients with 37 symptomatic atherosclerotic intracranial stenosis who underwent primary balloon angioplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had symptoms despite medical therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty-four patients were available for follow-up ranging from 6 to 128 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up was 52.9 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean pretreatment stenosis was 84.2% before angioplasty and 43.3% after angioplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The periprocedural <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate was 8.3% (two <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> and one minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> in the territory of angioplasty at 2 and 37 months after angioplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The annual <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate in the territory appropriate to the site of angioplasty was 3.36%, and for those patients with a residual stenosis of &gt; or =50% it was 4.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with iatrogenic dissection (n=11) did not have <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Results of long-term follow-up suggest that intracranial angioplasty without stent placement reduces the risk of further <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in symptomatic patients </plain></SENT>
