<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated the prevalence of carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, including mild early lesions, and its association with cervical bruits and various risk factors (age, male sex, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, and cigarette smoking) in 232 consecutive Japanese patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>High-resolution real-time B-mode ultrasonography was performed to determine the extent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, and it was quantified by using a scoring system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> was 49%, 59%, and 41% in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 232 patients, the 100 symptomatic patients, and the 132 asymptomatic patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although carotid lesions were detected frequently (87%) in the 30 patients with cervical bruits, bruits were noted in only 30% of the 88 examined patients with carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Independent risk factors for carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in these patients were found to be age, male sex, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo>; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> was a possible risk factor for carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our study did not show a close association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, and this might be caused by the high prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in our patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest an increasing prevalence of carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in the Japanese, though this should be confirmed in a population-based study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our study demonstrates the clinical usefulness of high-resolution B-mode ultrasonography for the evaluation of early carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
