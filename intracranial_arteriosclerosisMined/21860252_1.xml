<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> is an important etiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the USA, but its prevalence in the general population remains unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was performed to determine the feasibility of transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) for general population screening and to estimate the prevalence of intracranial stenosis in the USA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used a public database to randomly select 99 subjects aged 65-84 years residing in a well-defined geographic area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects clinical history was reviewed, blood pressure was recorded and TCD examination was performed to identify intracranial stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean age of subjects was 72 years, 42 were men, and 17 were African-Americans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> acoustic windows were present in 77 subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After multivariate adjustment, the odds of absence of a bone window were higher in African-Americans [odds ratio (OR) 6.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.8-2.0], nonsmokers (OR 3.1, 95% CI 1.0-9) and those with a high BMI (9% higher odds per index point) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among 77 subjects who had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> acoustic windows present, intracranial stenosis of &gt;50% was identified in 6.5%, and intracranial stenosis of any severity was identified in 16% of the persons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Intracranial stenosis was most prevalent in the middle cerebral artery (6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Presence of acoustic windows is associated with vascular risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Based on the high prevalence of significant intracranial stenosis in the US elderly population, it is feasible and important to perform a large-scale population-based study for this disease entity </plain></SENT>
