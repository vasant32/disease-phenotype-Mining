<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CASE DESCRIPTION: We present the case of a 69-year-old man with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100661'>trigeminal neuralgia</z:hpo> who underwent stereotactic radiosurgery after a failed balloon compression procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The radiosurgery also failed to provide the patient with any significant pain relief, and microvascular decompression of the trigeminal nerve was performed 10 months later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At operation, two adjacent veins and the superior cerebellar artery were noted to have focal changes consistent with atheromatous disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We postulate that the recent radiation exposure resulted in the observed vascular injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As a result, patients having <z:hpo ids='HP_0100661'>trigeminal neuralgia</z:hpo> radiosurgery need to be followed carefully for possible delayed ischemic events secondary to radiation-induced vascular injury </plain></SENT>
