<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Pathological findings were obstruction of small artery lumens by hypertrophic endothelium and loose fibrocellular bands, their origin being the result possibly of partial intimalization of media by elastic neogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Appearances were similar to those described by Dahl in human cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in 1976, and approached those of the initial stages of experimental atheroma (Ross, Glomset, 1976) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Arterial exiguity was also present in the 4 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results of biologic, metabolic, inflammatory and immunologic examinations were negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The present study concerns 4 additional cases of juvenile distal encephalic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One case in a female patient not on oral contraceptives confirmed the hypothesis of intimalization of media of arterioles of big toe pulp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Elastic neogenesis was present in the tunica media in areas where there was a change of direction of myocytes, and was apparent at a distance from the internal elastic layer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The latter was fragmented, sometimes doubles and of variable color </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In another case, a woman taking oral contraceptives, there was almost total obstruction of the pulp arteriolar lumens with a very thin tunica media </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Elastic neogenesis encircled two very narrow lumens in the center of the vessel and there were also elastic changes common to both.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
