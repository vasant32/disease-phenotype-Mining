<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Angiographic measurements were more reproducible than those of B-mode scans for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> parameters except lesion width, but variations for B-mode scan measurements were similar to those for angiographic measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Within-reader agreement on the presence of ulceration was substantial for both modalities, whereas between-reader agreement was poor for B-mode scan and only moderate for angiography </plain></SENT>
