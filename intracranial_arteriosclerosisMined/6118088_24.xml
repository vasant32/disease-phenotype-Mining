<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Four adults patients who experienced an ipsilateral hemispheric deficit 6 to 8 weeks after having developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019364" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herpes zoster ophthalmicus</z:e> were seen during a six-month period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> four patients underwent full-circle angiography, including study of the extracranial arteries in the three older patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Each examination demonstrated areas of segmental constriction of arteries on the ipsilateral side; two locations that were especially affected were the A2 segment of the pericallosal artery beneath the genu of the corpus callosum and the M4 segment of the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cerebral arteries of the opposite hemisphere and the extracranial vessels did not contain demonstrable abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pathological studies suggest that patients with this syndrome may have a necrotizing <z:hpo ids='HP_0012089'>arteritis</z:hpo> of ipsilateral blood vessels; in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0276248" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">disseminated zoster</z:e>, a granulomatous <z:mp ids='MP_0001864'>angiitis</z:mp> of cerebral blood vessels has been found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We propose that the pattern of angiographic abnormalities described here is characteristic of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019360" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="ZONA">herpes zoster</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0012089'>arteritis</z:hpo>; furthermore, the distribution pattern of the lesions suggests that the virus may spread to these arteries via branches of the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve </plain></SENT>
