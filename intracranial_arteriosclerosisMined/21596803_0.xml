<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, technologies to evaluate the volume of atherosclerotic plaque are limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We present a method for determination of 3D plaque volume based on RA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: 3DRA images obtained from patients were used to evaluate the plaque </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Six patients who were diagnosed with <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The PR model developed for 3DRA was applied to analyze the geometry of the vessel and calculate the plaque volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To validate the present method, we tested computer-generated phantoms with different degrees of stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Application of PR to clinical cases allowed the estimation of plaque <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and quantification of plaque volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Technique validation showed that on average, PR can rebuild 92% of the plaque and provide satisfactory determination of plaque volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A new approach to obtain plaque volume based on 3DRA is presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The initial tests in 6 clinical cases and validation with different phantoms showed that this method is feasible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further validation in a larger clinical series is required to assess the ultimate value of the present technique </plain></SENT>
