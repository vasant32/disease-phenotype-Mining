<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This is due to the resurgence of interest in endarterectomy for severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although the degree of stenosis can usually be assessed adequately by duplex Doppler ultrasonography, angiography is still recommended as a preoperative examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The intracranial vessels are visualised, which we consider important when planning vascular surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We present a prospective study of 100 patients referred for angiographic assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As well as giving information about the carotid bifurcation, angiography showed 9 patients to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformations</z:hpo> and 15 severe intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We consider these "incidental" findings important for future management and highlight the need for thorough assessment of the intracranial vessels in these patients by angiography </plain></SENT>
