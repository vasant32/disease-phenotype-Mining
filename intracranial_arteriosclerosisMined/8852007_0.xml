<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whereas in the case of older patients the main cause is <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo>, in the younger group a broad spectrum of etiologies can be found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is for this reason that in these latter cases we must carry out a diagnostic study that is not only more exhaustive but also additionally is aimed at seeking out specific pathologies as for instance a possible association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious diseases</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001871'>hematological abnormalities</z:hpo> or unclear cardiopathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Given the therapeutic transcendency that findings might have, in order to avoid new bouts in patients at the most productive moments in their lives, we believe it to be of great interest to carefully study these patients as exhaustively as need be </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the present work we present the case of a young patient with ischaemic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in the region of both upper cerebella which started out with a clinical picture of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001260'>dysarthria</z:hpo> with benign course and total recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Possible etiologies are discussed in the light of findings made during complementary tests, as well as the unusual location of the lesions </plain></SENT>
