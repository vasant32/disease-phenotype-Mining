<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: Medically refractory, symptomatic atherosclerotic disease of the basilar artery (BA) portends a poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Studies have shown morbidity rates following placement of stents in these lesions to be quite variable, ranging from 0 to 30% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors review their experience with BA stent placement for severe atherosclerotic disease to determine whether an increase in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1301721" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological morbidity</z:e> is associated with direct stent placement (that performed without predilation angioplasty) compared with conventional stent placement (that performed immediately after predilation angioplasty) or staged stent placement (angioplasty followed &gt; or = 1 month later by stent placement with or without repeated angioplasty) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors retrospectively reviewed the medical records from a consecutive series of 10 patients who underwent stent placement for medically refractory, symptomatic atherosclerotic disease of the BA between February 1999 and November 2002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patient records were analyzed for symptoms at presentation, percentage of angiographically visible stenosis, devices used, procedure-related morbidity, and clinical and radiographic outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with symptomatic intracranial vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> but without concomitant severe (&gt; 50%) BA stenosis were excluded from the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four patients were treated with direct stent placement, three with a staged procedure (these were included in a previous publication), and three with conventional stent placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the group treated with direct stent placement, a dense <z:hpo ids='HP_0002273'>quadriparesis</z:hpo> developed in two patients after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Computerized tomography or magnetic resonance imaging revealed infarction of the ventral pons in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the staged stent placement group, no permanent neurological complications occurred after the procedure and, in the conventional stent placement group, one of three patients experienced a neurological complication involving homonymous hemianopsia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Direct stent placement in the BA is associated with a relatively high complication rate, compared with a staged procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Complications may result from an embolic shower following disruption of atheromatous plaque debris attained using high-profile devices such as stents, as demonstrated by the postoperative imaging appearance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> pontine infarctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Additionally, displacement of debris by the stent into the ostia (snowplowing) of small brainstem perforating vessels may be responsible for the complications noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Although direct stent placement in peripheral and coronary vessels has been shown to be safe, the authors suggest that direct stent placement in the BA should be avoided to minimize the risk of periprocedure morbidity </plain></SENT>
