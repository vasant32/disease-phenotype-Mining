<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Seven patients underwent PET both before and after undergoing EC-IC bypass surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three of the 7 patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tia|TIA|T.I.A.">transient ischaemic attacks</z:e> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo>) and 4 had minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five of the 7 had unilateral superficial temporal-middle cerebral artery (STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) anastomosis, one had bilateral STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomoses and one had STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis on one side and carotid endarterectomy on the other side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PET showed postoperative improvement in regional cerebral blood flow and metabolism in 5 of the 7 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the remaining 2 patients, one showed no remarkable changes on PET and the other showed exacerbation on PET due to postoperative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three patients who had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> had no further <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two of the 3 patients postoperatively showed improvement in misery perfusion on PET </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the 4 patients who had minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, 2 showed clinical improvements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One of the 2 showed improvement not only in motor function but also in the higher cortical functions such as verbal and performance intelligence quotients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Changes on PET correlated to the clinical improvement in 4 of 7 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The EC-IC bypass is therefore effective in patients with haemodynamic hypoperfusion syndromes by improving the state of low perfusion </plain></SENT>
