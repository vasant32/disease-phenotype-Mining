<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In cases with simple forms of senile <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> a tendency towards <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>hypercoagulability</z:hpo> was established (an increased formation of thrombin, the amount of fibrinogen content) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, this group demonstrated a defensive activation of the anticoagulative system, sufficient to maintain an equilibrium in the whole system of hemocoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An exhaustion of compensation may lead to stasis and microthrombosis in the smallest vessels and capillaries, which indicates to the pathogenetical significance of changes in the coagulative blood properties </plain></SENT>
