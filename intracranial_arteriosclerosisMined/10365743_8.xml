<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There is no consensus on the efficacy of the antithrombotic drugs available for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004417'>intermittent claudication</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A Medline and manual search was used to identify relevant publications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Uncontrolled or retrospective studies, double reports or trials without clinical outcomes were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Included studies were graded as level 1 (randomised and double- or assessor-blind), level 2 (open randomised), or level 3 (non-randomised comparative) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mortality, cerebro- or cardiovascular events, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_686'>amputations</z:mpath>, <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusions</z:mp> or number of revascularization procedures performed in the lower limbs, pain-free and total walking distance, ankle brachial index and calf blood flow, were the main outcomes considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When feasible, end of treatment results, either continuous or binary, were combined with appropriate statistical methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mortality was significantly decreased by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9588">ticlopidine</z:chebi> compared to placebo (common odds ratio 0.68, 95% C.I., 0.49 - 0.95); <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi> decreased vascular events in comparison to aspirin (odds ratio 0.76, 95% C.I., 0.63 - 0.92) in level 1 studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>Arterial occlusions</z:mp> and the number of revascularization procedures performed were statistically significantly decreased by aspirin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9588">ticlopidine</z:chebi>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A small but statistically significant improvement in pain-free walking distance was determined by picotamide, indobufen, low molecular weight <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24505">heparins</z:chebi>, sulodexide and defibrotide, in small studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">Clopidogrel</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9588">ticlopidine</z:chebi> do reduce clinically important events in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004417'>intermittent claudication</z:hpo> and could be added to the primary medical treatment of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The use of aspirin in these patients cannot be based on direct evidence, but only on analogy with coronary and cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, where it has documented efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Other antithrombotic drugs were not properly evaluated in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004417'>intermittent claudication</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
