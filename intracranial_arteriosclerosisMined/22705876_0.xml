<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Symptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic disease (ICAD) worldwide represents one of the most prevalent causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>When severe, studies show that it has a very high risk for recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, highlighting the need for effective preventative strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mainstay of treatment has been medical therapy and is of critical importance in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Endovascular therapy is also a possible therapeutic option but much remains to be defined in terms of best techniques and patient selection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This guideline will serve as recommendations for diagnosis and endovascular treatment of patients with ICAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A literature review was performed to extract published literature regarding ICAD, published from 2000 to 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Evidence was evaluated and classified according to American Heart Association (<z:chebi fb="30" ids="27777">AHA</z:chebi>)/American <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Association standard </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Recommendations are made based on available evidence assessed by the Standards Committee of the Society of NeuroInterventional Surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The assessment was based on guidelines for evidence based medicine proposed by the American Academy of Neurology (AAN), the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Council of the <z:chebi fb="30" ids="27777">AHA</z:chebi> and the University of Oxford, Centre for Evidence Based Medicine (CEBM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 59 publications were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The SAMMPRIS study is the only prospective, randomized, controlled trial available and is given an <z:chebi fb="30" ids="27777">AHA</z:chebi> level B designation, AAN class II and CEBM level 1b </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The Stenting of Symptomatic <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>Atherosclerotic Lesions</z:mp> in the Vertebral or Intracranial arteries (SSYLVIA) trial was a prospective, non-randomized study with the outcome assessment made by a non-operator study neurologist, allowing an <z:chebi fb="30" ids="27777">AHA</z:chebi> level B, AAN class III and CEBM level 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The remaining studies were uncontrolled or did not have objective outcome measurement, and are thus classified as <z:chebi fb="30" ids="27777">AHA</z:chebi> level C, AAN class IV and CEBM level 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Medical management with combination aspirin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi> for 3 months and aggressive risk factor modification is the firstline therapy for patients with symptomatic ICAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Endovascular angioplasty with or without stenting is a possible therapeutic option for selected patients with symptomatic ICAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Further studies are necessary to define appropriate patient selection and the best therapeutic approach for various subsets of patients </plain></SENT>
