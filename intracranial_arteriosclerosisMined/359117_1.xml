<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two delayed matching to sample tasks were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>ABA1 involved random visual shapes used as a measure of visual memory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ABA2 involved nonsense syllable trigrams used as a measure of verbal memory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A Human Test System panel with a display screen was utilized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This screen was a rear view projection window divided into four independent 3 X 2 sections arranged in a 2 X 2 matrix </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The sample stimulus appeared on the upper left window for one second </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The delay interval between stimulus sample and choices varied by 7 seconds dependent upon patient performance per trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Also utilized was a color distractor task </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Task parameters, data acquisition, retrieval, and graphic print-outs were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> computerized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Individual titration levels reflected the severity of neurological impairment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Computerized assessment enabled subtle changes in memory performance to be readily identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Implications for use of the system as a screening device in the assessment of mental changes in the elderly are apparent </plain></SENT>
