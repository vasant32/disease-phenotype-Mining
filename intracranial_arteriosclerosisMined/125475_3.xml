<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of 465 autopsied adult Nigerians, 62 (13%) had cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The frequency and severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> among Nigerians with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, particularly male subjects, were higher than in normotensives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although there was a similar frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> among autopsied Nigerian and Minnesota Caucasian populations, the severity and extent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> were greater in the Minnesota Caucasian populations, the severity and extent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> were greater in the Minnesota population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The relatively short duration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in the Nigerian before <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> might be an important factor which did not permit progressive development of cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Other factors which predisposed the Nigerian to increased frequency and severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> included <z:mp ids='MP_0002833'>increased heart weight</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The relatively low frequency of cerebrovascular disease in the Nigerian may be explained on the basis of a low degree of cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and relatively short duration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
