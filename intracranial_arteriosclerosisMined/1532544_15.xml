<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Cilazapril, a converting <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23924">enzyme inhibitor</z:chebi>, has been shown to significantly decrease the extent of intimal smooth muscle cell proliferation after arterial injury in a normotensive rat model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: To assess the influence of cilazapril on myofibrotic changes after balloon injury, control (n = 7) or cilazapril-treated (n = 9) (20 mg/kg b.i.d.) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> 3-month-old pigs underwent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> angioplasty of the right, and deendothelialization of the left common carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Carotid arteries isolated at 4 weeks were examined morphometrically with a computerized digitizer after in situ glutaraldehyde fixation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both in the deendothelialized and dilated arteries, the surface area in square millimeters of the neointima and media were similar in the treated and control animals; therefore, the ratio of neointima to media was again not different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The neointimal changes included a combination of proliferative changes as well as organization of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333205,C1260883" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mural thrombus</z:e> and were equally well distributed in the two groups of animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At the time that the animals were killed, blood pressure (38.2 +/- 2.1 versus 56.8 +/- 4.8 mm Hg, p = 0.003) and plasma angiotensin converting enzyme activity (5.6 +/- 4.1 versus 182.3 +/- 70.4, p = 0.02) were lower in treated than in control pigs, but aortic media thrombogenicity (as assessed in an ex vivo perfusion flow chamber) and serum <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> were not different between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In pigs, cilazapril did not alter the development of myofibrotic changes after mild or severe balloon injury despite plasma angiotensin converting enzyme activity inhibition </plain></SENT>
