<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 53-year-old woman underwent surgical thrombendarterectomy for treatment of artherosclerotic stenoses of her left internal carotid artery (ICA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A Fogarty catheter was used during this operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The postoperative course was complicated by the development of a sixth <z:hpo ids='HP_0006824'>cranial nerve palsy</z:hpo>, protrusio, chemosis and ciliar injection of both eyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Digital subtraction angiography showed a direct <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> between the cavernous segment of the left ICA and the cavernous sinus, with early and retrograde opacification of both superior ophthalmic veins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Endovascular occlusion of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> was achieved with preservation of the ICA by stent deployment over the rupture site of the ICA, as two detachable balloons could not obliterate the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> while preserving the ICA patent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Follow-up angiography 7 months after the endovascular treatment confirmed persisting occlusion of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> with a patent ICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Highly flexible porous coronary stents can easily be introduced into tortuous vessels, including the distal ICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The haemodynamic effects achieved by stent deployment together with two balloons detached in the cavernous sinus may be sufficient to interrupt a direct carotid cavernous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
