<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Along with the recent changes in lifestyle in Japan, the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> has increased while the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> appears to be decreasing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the relation between the progression of carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> in the Japanese population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The 2-year change in extracranial carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in 50 Japanese patients who underwent coronary angiography was evaluated using carotid echotomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To quantify the extent of carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, the maximal thickness measurements of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> plaques were summed for an individual plaque score, except for new plaques found on reexamination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0741975" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Carotid disease</z:e> progression was evaluated by the sum of plaque score change and the thickness of the new plaque found on reexamination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The plaque score changed by -3.2 to 10.1 mm (mean +/- SD, 1.06 +/- 2.42 mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The extent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004929'>coronary atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (p less than 0.02) and serum total cholesterol level (p less than 0.01) were different between the progressing (n = 17) and the nonprogressing (n = 30) groups of carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> when the progressing group included the patients with a delta plaque score of greater than or equal to 1.0 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neither age, serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> level, serum <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> level, pack-years of smoking, percentage of smokers, percentage of hypertensive patients, nor percentage of diabetic patients was different between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0741975" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Carotid disease</z:e> progression was significantly higher in patients with three-vessel <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary disease</z:hpo> than in patients without significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (p less than 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was a significant positive linear correlation between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0741975" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid disease</z:e> progression and Gensini's <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> score (R = 0.411, p less than 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data showed that severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> and a high serum total cholesterol level were strong predictors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0741975" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid disease</z:e> progression in Japanese patients with high rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
