<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared the efficacy of 2 combinations of antiplatelets, aspirin plus cilostazol (cilostazol group) verus aspirin plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi> group), on the progression of ICAS, which is known to be associated with clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this investigator-initiated double-blind trial, 457 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> symptomatic stenosis in the M1 segment of the middle cerebral artery or the basilar artery were randomly allocated into either a cilostazol group or a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After 7 months of treatment, follow-up <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiogram and MRI were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary end point was the progression of ICAS in comparison with stenosis on the baseline <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Secondary end points included the occurrence of new ischemic lesions on MRI, composite of cardiovascular events, and major <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Cardiovascular events occurred in 15 of 232 patients (6.4%) in the cilostazol group and 10 of 225 (4.4%) in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi> group (P=0.312) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cilostazol did not reduce the progression of symptomatic ICAS (20 of 202) compared to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi> (32 of 207) (odds ratio, 0.61; P=0.092), although favorable changes in serum <z:chebi fb="2" ids="6495">lipoproteins</z:chebi> were observed in the cilostazol group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences between the 2 groups with respect to new ischemic lesions (18.7% versus 12.0%; P=0.078) and major hemorrhagic complications (0.9% versus 2.6%; P=0.163) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This trial failed to show significant difference in preventing progression of ICAS and new ischemic lesions between the 2 combination antiplatelet therapies in the patients with symptomatic ICAS </plain></SENT>
