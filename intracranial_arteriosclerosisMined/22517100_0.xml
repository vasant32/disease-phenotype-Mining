<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We consecutively included <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients with confirmed lacunae-sized <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischemic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in the penetrating arterial territories on diffusion-weighted MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Based on diffusion-weighted MRI, the shape of ischemic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> was divided into oval or conglomerated beads shape </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Demographics, risk factors, NIH <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) score at admission and discharge, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> mechanisms were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Early <z:hpo ids='HP_0002344'>neurologic deterioration</z:hpo> was defined as any increase of NIHSS score at the time of discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 105 patients included, the conglomerated beads shape of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> was observed in 34 (32.4%) patients and the oval shape in 71 (67.6%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The baseline characteristics were not different between the 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the maximal diameter of the lesion was significantly larger in the conglomerated beads shape group (12.8 ± 3.3 mm vs 10.8 ± 3.8 mm, p = 0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Early <z:hpo ids='HP_0002344'>neurologic deterioration</z:hpo> was also more commonly observed in the conglomerated beads shape group than in the oval shape group (20.6% vs 4.2%, p = 0.012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that the conglomerated beads shape was significantly associated with early <z:hpo ids='HP_0002344'>neurologic deterioration</z:hpo> (odds ratio 6.83, 95% confidence interval 1.53-30.55, p = 0.012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In 32.4% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the lacunae-sized <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in the perforating artery territory, the conglomerated beads shape was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This shape was significantly associated with early <z:hpo ids='HP_0002344'>neurologic deterioration</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
