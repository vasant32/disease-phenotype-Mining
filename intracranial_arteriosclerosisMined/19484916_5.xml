<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was undertaken to determine the roles of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> (AD) and vascular pathology in mediating the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> E (APOE)-epsilon4 alleles on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinicopathologic correlations were studied in 267 Catholic sisters participating in the Nun Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The extent to which AD and vascular pathologies mediated the effect of APOEepsilon4 on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was investigated using multiple logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Adjusted for age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and education, possession of 1 or more epsilon4 alleles was an important risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (odds ratio=2.98; 95% confidence interval, 1.62-5.48) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This association was lost (odds ratio=1.38; 95% confidence interval, 0.68-2.80) when an index of the severity of AD-related neuropathology was added to the model, but changed little when measures of the severity of vascular pathology were added </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The findings suggest that the effect of epsilon4 on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> is mediated by the severity of AD pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> contribute to the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, this contribution seems unrelated to APOE genotype </plain></SENT>
