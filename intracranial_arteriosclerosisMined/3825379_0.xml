<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The author has studied 17 patients with senile <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> and its combination (in case of an underlying atrophic process) with cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> but without local pathomorphological changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been found that in senile <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> the multilevel and multiaspect functional system of speech is impaired at both, a lower, phonetic, and higher speech (a phonological analysis) levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Other findings with regard to the speech level include disturbances of programming a speech statement or internal speech (dynamic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo>), impairment of grammatical structuring and damaged lexical choice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The above disturbances (above <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> programming of the internal speech) are linked with intellectual deviations and are secondary to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> of the frontal lobes </plain></SENT>
