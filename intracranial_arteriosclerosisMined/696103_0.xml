<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The achieved data indicate its mild hypotensive effect, an increase of the module of elasticity of the walls in large brain vessels along with a distinct decrease in the cerebral vascular resistance, as well as an improvement of the venous outflow of blood due to the influence of droperidol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The effect of this preparation appeared to be more expressed in patients with hemmorrhages into the brain and its membranes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A drop in the amplitude of brain fluctuations along with a drop of the arterial pressure made it possible to adequately correct the prescription of droperidol to patients with disturbed brain circulation </plain></SENT>
