<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Disruption of the endothelial layer is the first step in the atherogenic process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Experimental studies have shown that endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) are involved in endothelial homeostasis and repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Conversely, EPC <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> has been demonstrated in the setting of established atherosclerotic diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With this background, we evaluated whether variations in the number of EPCs are associated with subclinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Carotid intima-media thickness (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>), high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP), levels of circulating EPCs, and cardiovascular risk were compared in 137 healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six subpopulations of progenitor cells were determined by flow cytometry on the basis of the surface expression of CD34, CD133, and KDR antigens: CD34(+), CD133(+), CD34(+)CD133(+), CD34(+)KDR(+), CD133(+)KDR(+), and CD34(+)CD133(+)KDR(+) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among different antigenic profiles of EPCs, only CD34(+)KDR(+) cells were significantly reduced in subjects with increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Specifically, CD34(+)KDR(+) cells were inversely correlated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>, even after adjustment for hsCRP and 10-year Framingham risk and independently of other cardiovascular parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>Depletion</z:mpath> of CD34(+)KDR(+) EPCs is an independent predictor of early subclinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in healthy subjects and may provide additional information beyond classic risk factors and inflammatory markers </plain></SENT>
