<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the cause and severity of intracranial arterial lesions in extensive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> (CI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 78 consecutive autopsy cases were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They included 58 cases of CI and 20 cases of other diseases as control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Medium-sized intracranial arteries and their main branches, small intracerebral arteries, and arterioles were examined with light microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Quantitative analysis was made with computer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CI due to embolism was seen in 33/58 (56.9%) cases, <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in 11/58 (19%), and unknown etiology in 14/58 (24.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean LA-VA ratios of the medium-sized intracranial arteries and their main branches, small intracerebral arteries and arterioles were lower in the CI patients than in the controls (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Atherosclerotic narrowing of the distal part of M1 segment of both lateral cerebral middle arteries, the basilar arteries and the main branches in the patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was markedly more severe than in those with embolism (P &lt; 0.05, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patients with CI have arterial lesions of different levels but the principal portions of cerebral artery lesions are the medium-sized intracranial arteries and their main branches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>Thrombosis</z:mp> and embolism with medium, severe atherosclerotic narrowing of several arteries may play an important role in causing extensive CI in the middle aged and the elderly </plain></SENT>
