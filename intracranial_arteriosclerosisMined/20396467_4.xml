<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> is considered a cause of approximately 8% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> in the western society </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, its frequency is much higher in Asian countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In our hospital-based study, among the patients who had angiographic abnormalities, the frequency of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> was approximately 70% far exceeding that of extratracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic atherosclerotic diseases were most often found in the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Generally, it has been shown that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo> are related to extracranial diseases while advance <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> is associated with intracranial diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, these results have not always been replicated, and certain genetic factors may be related with the ethnic differences in the location of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Recent studies using diffusion weighted MRI showed that the main mechanisms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in patients with intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> are the branch occlusion, artery to artery embolism and both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The intracranial stenosis, especially symptomatic one, is not a static condition and may progress or regress in a relatively short period of time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Progressive stenosis of intracranial arteries is clearly related to the development of ischemic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The annual risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> relevant to the stenosed intracranial vessel is approximately 8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In retrospective studies including ASID, anticoagulation was found to be superior to aspirin in reducing the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, a recent prospective study failed to confirm the superiority of anticoagulation over aspirin in patients with intracranial stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Moreover, anticoagulation resulted in excessive central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> as compared to aspirin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Because aspirin alone seems to be insufficient in the prevention of progression of intracranial stenosis, a combination of antiplatelets has been tried </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Recently, we found that a combination of aspirin + cilostazol was superior to aspirin monotherapy in the prevention of progression of symptomatic intracranial stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>However, further studies are required to find out the best combination of antiplatelets for symptomatic intracranial stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The effect of other atheroma stabilizers such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> should also be properly evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Angioplasty/stent is another important option for the relatively severe intracranial stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>According to previous studies, immediate success rate has reached up to 90% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>If patients are carefully selected, and procedures done by experienced hand, angioplasty/stent can be of benefit especially in relatively young patients with proximal, short-segment, severe symptomatic stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>However, this procedure is not without complications or long-term re-stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Further studies are required to elucidate the best therapeutic strategy in patients with intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
