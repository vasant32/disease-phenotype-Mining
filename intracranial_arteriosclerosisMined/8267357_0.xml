<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Practically, the limitations of these techniques must be taken into account such that the appropriate method is applied to answer a specific clinical question and the acquisition parameters are chosen to maximise the sensitivity and specificity of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Based upon these results, it must be decided whether the conventional parenchymal <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> and MRA evaluations are sufficient in a particular setting or whether it is necessary to commit the patient to a more traditional, invasive angiographic study for a more thorough investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Presently, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiographic studies and flow measurement techniques serve to compliment the more traditional spin-echo evaluation of patients with small <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, arterial and venous occlusions, vascular malformations and in some cases of neoplastic vascular invasion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With well-trained technicians and carefully prescribed protocols, this new information and improved diagnostic sensitivity can be used routinely with only a minor increase in patient exam time </plain></SENT>
