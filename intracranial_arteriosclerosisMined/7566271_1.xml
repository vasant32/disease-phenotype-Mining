<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results of 433 carotid arteries in 174 patients indicate a positive correlation in measurements of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> between internal and common carotid arteries (P &lt; 0.001), but no correlation between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> measurements and three-dimensional measurements of plaque volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For follow-up studies of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery disease</z:e> the three-dimensional volume measurements are the best method of evaluating progression or regression of focal plaque volume </plain></SENT>
