<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Eighty-four consecutive intact atheromata from the carotid bifurcation were examined macroscopically and by standard microscopic techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Preoperative angiograms of these cases were reviewed by a single radiologist with special attention to detecting the presence of ulceration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pathologic and angiographic findings were compared and correlated with the patient's clinical presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Macroscopic findings of ulceration were present in 43 cases (51%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty-four specimens contained intramural <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> and 27 showed evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333205,C1260883" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mural thrombus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333205,C1260883" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Mural thrombus</z:e> was significantly associated with evidence of ulceration (p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intramural <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> was commonly associated with ulceration (25/34) but was also seen in nonulcerated plaques (p greater than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Angiographic diagnosis of ulceration was made in 54 cases (64%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>While angiography identified 78% of macroscopic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcers</z:mpath> (34/43; p = 0.05), seven typical ulcerations were missed angiographically and there were 18 angiographic false positive results (18/54:33%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Macroscopic ulcerations were most common in patients with symptoms of hemispheric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (p less than 0.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The angiographic diagnosis of ulceration did not correlate with the patient's clinical presentation (i.e., hemispheric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, nonhemispheric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, or asymptomatic stenosis) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results support the thesis that macroscopic ulceration is an important cause of hemispheric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Angiography does not reliably predict the presence of macroscopic ulceration and this limitation should be kept in mind when patients with hemispheric symptoms are evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Such patients should not be denied consideration for endarterectomy simply because the angiogram fails to demonstrate ulceration </plain></SENT>
