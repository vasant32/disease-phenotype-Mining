<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since <z:mp ids='MP_0003982'>increased cholesterol levels</z:mp> lead to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, identification of the carries of the apo B-3500 mutation is an important step in the risk stratification of individuals and families with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of this mutation in Turkish population is not well known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We aimed to investigate the frequency of apo B-100 mutations (codon 3500) C9774T (Arg 3500--&gt;Trp) and G9775A (Arg 3500--&gt;Gln) in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in comparison with healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 442 unrelated subjects living on the West coast of Turkey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subgroups consisted of 165 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo>, 163 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, and 114 healthy control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We did not find any apo B-100 mutation both in the patient and control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: As it is hypothesized that this mutation arose within the Central European region from a common ancestor approximately 7000 years ago and spread across Europe, our result of the absence of the R3500Q mutation in Turkish patients give an important information about the geographical distribution of the apo B-R3500Q, that the mutation has not reached to Anatolia </plain></SENT>
