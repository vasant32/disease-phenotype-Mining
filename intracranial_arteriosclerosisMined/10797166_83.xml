<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We identified <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> residents of Rochester, Minnesota, with a first <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> from 1985 through 1989 using the resources of the Rochester Epidemiology Project medical records linkage system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After reviewing medical records and imaging studies, we assigned patients to 4 major <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> categories based on National Institute of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Neurological Diseases</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Data Bank criteria: large-vessel cervical or intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> with stenosis (ATH, n=74), cardioembolic (CE, n=132), lacunar (LAC, n=72), and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> of uncertain cause (IUC, n=164) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used the Rankin disability score to assess functional outcome and the Kaplan-Meier product-limit method and Cox proportional hazards regression analysis with bootstrap validation to estimate rates and identify predictors of survival and recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> among these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Rankin disabilities were different across <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes at the time of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and 3 months and 1 year later (P=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>LAC was associated with milder deficits compared with other subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up among the 442 patients in the cohort was 3.2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Estimated rates of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> at 30 days were significantly different (P&lt;0.001): ATH, 18.5% (95% CI 9.4% to 27.5%); CE, 5.3% (95% CI 1.2% to 9.6%); LAC, 1.4% (95% CI 0.0% to 4.1%); and IUC, 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>3% (95% CI 0.4% to 6.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for age, sex, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> severity, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> subtype was an independent determinant of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> within 30 days (P=0.0006; eg, risk ratio for ATH compared with CE=3.3, 95% CI 1.2 to 9.3) but not long term (P=0.07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Four of 25 recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> within 30 days were procedure-related, each in patients with ATH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Five-year <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rates were significantly different (P&lt;0.001): ATH, 32.2% (95% CI 21.1% to 43.2%); CE, 80.4% (95% CI 73.1% to 87.6%); LAC, 35.1% (95% CI 23.6% to 46.0%); and IUC, 48.6% (95% CI 40.5% to 56.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>With adjustment for age, sex, cardiac comorbidity, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> severity, the subtype of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> was an independent determinant of long-term (P=0.018; eg, risk ratio for ATH compared with cardioembolic=0.47, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.77) but not 30-day survival (P=0.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Early recurrence rates for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> caused by ATH are higher than those for other subtypes and higher than previous non-population-based studies have reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Some of the increased risk of early recurrence among patients with ATH may be iatrogenic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Patients with LAC have better poststroke functional status than those with other subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Survival is poorest among those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> with a cardiac source of embolism </plain></SENT>
