<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>An operative case of 12-year-old boy with a saccular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> at the anterior communicating artery was reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>He had episodes of occasional <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> during one year before admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>He was attacked by a severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002017'>nausea and vomiting</z:hpo>, and was admitted to Ooita Pref </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hospital under the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> four days later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On admission physical examinations revealed almost <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> findings except for moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001944'>dehydration</z:hpo> and a blood pressure of 130/70 mmHg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Routine examinations (blood, serum including total cholesterol, urine, ECG and plain chest X-film) were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neurologically there were lethalgic state, moderate nuchal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002063'>rigidity</z:hpo> and bilateral abducens <z:mp ids='MP_0000754'>paresis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Slightly hemorrhagic and xanthochromic CSF was demonstrated by a spinal puncture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was found at the anterior communicating artery on the right carotid arteriogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The left carotid and the left vertebral arteriograms showed no pathologic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Operation via right fronto-temporal approach disclosed a berry <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> about 4 mm in diameter arising from the bifurcation of the right anterior cerebral and the anterior communicating artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was a plaque presumably an atherosclerotic change at the neck of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Clipping of the aneurysmal neck was done </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was not visualized on the postoperative arteriogram, and the patient was discharged in good condition two weeks after the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>It is true that this patient had a lesion which seemed to be an atherosclerotic plaque at the neck of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> macroscopically, but he did not have any evidence of generalized <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> or other metabolic disturbance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This plaque may be of special significance in etiological respect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In general, however, degenerative lesions like <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> occur predominantly in larger arteries than smaller arteries of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Also the location of this <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was at the anterior communicating artery which is reported to be implicated in anomalous vascularity on occasion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>From these facts the authors considered combined congenital and acquired factors in the development of this <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
