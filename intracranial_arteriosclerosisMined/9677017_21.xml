<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the relation between plasma concentrations of total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> (tHcy) and common carotid artery intima-media wall thickness, measured by B-mode ultrasonography, in 513 asymptomatic men and women from eastern Finland aged 45-69 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The subjects were examined in 1994-95 at the baseline of the <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">Antioxidant</z:chebi> Supplementation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>Atherosclerosis</z:hpo> Prevention (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ASAP</z:e>) study, a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled two by two factorial trial on the effect of vitamin E and C supplementation in the prevention of atherosclerotic progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The subjects were assigned into two categories according to the plasma tHcy concentration; concentration over 11.5 micromol/L (highest quartile) or concentration below 11.5 micromol/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study population the mean plasma tHcy concentration was 10.0 micromol/L, and the prevalence of plasma tHcy concentration exceeding 11.5 micromol/L was 33% in men and 18% in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The adjusted mean intima-media thickness of the right and left common carotid arteries was 1.12 mm in men with elevated plasma tHcy concentration and 1.02 mm in men with a plasma tHcy concentration below 11.5 micromol/L (P = 0.029) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In women there was no significant difference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that elevated plasma tHcy concentrations are associated with early <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, as manifested by increased common carotid artery intima-media wall thickness, in middle-aged eastern Finnish men </plain></SENT>
