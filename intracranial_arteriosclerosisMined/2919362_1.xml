<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the duration of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> required to produce significant ischemic damage when the occlusion occurs during controlled systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 21 anesthetized cynomolgus monkeys, an IV infusion of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29321">sodium nitroprusside</z:chebi> was used to lower the mean arterial blood pressure to 45-50 mmHg for 90 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> for 15, 30, 45, or 60 minutes was performed during the hypotensive period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neurological function was then evaluated every 8 hours for a total of 72 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At the end of the observation period, the monkeys were again anesthetized, magnetic resonance imaging was performed, and the brain was perfused with 10% buffered formalin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neurological deficits were observed after 30 minutes, but not after 15 minutes, of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, and rapidly increased in incidence and severity when the duration of occlusion was increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After 60 minutes of occlusion, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the monkeys exhibited severe deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four monkeys died during the observation period--two in each of the 45- and 60-minute occlusion groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Histopathological examination revealed that little or no ischemic damage resulted from a 15-minute occlusion during <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, severe ischemic damage began to occur after only 30 minutes of occlusion, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> monkeys subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> for 60 minutes developed extensive regions of infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The size and incidence of these infarctions correlated well with the lesions observed in the magnetic resonance images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that the duration of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> that produces <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> in primates is drastically reduced when the occlusion occurs at hypotensive levels commonly employed during neurovascular surgical procedures </plain></SENT>
