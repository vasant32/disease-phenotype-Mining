<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cervical and cerebral magnetic resonance angiography(MRA) was performed in 133 patients (98 males, 35 females, mean age 65.3 years) with suspected <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo>, who were divided into a zero- and one-vessel disease group(n = 71) and a two- and three-vessel disease group(n = 62) depending on the number of major coronary branches with 75% or more stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The MRA lesion was defined as more than 50% stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) of the brain was performed within 1 week of MRA in 78 patients without symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> on MRI was defined as a focal high intensity area on T2-weighted images larger than 3 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The prevalence of MRA lesions was significantly greater in the two- and three-vessel group than in the zero- and one-vessel group(53% vs 14%, p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of MRI lesion was significantly higher in the two- and three-vessel group than in the zero- and one-vessel group(77% vs 36%, p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The size and number of the MRI lesions were also significantly greater in the two- and three-vessel group than in the zero- and one-vessel group(p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neither age nor percentage of male gender was different between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>Diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> was the common risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo>, MRA lesion and MRI lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Cervical and cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and silent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> are frequently observed in patients with multivessel <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
