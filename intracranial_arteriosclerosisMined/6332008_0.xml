<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mortality, however, is rising in some countries, particularly in Bulgaria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cerebrovascular mortality seems highest in moderately prosperous countries where the diet is largely vegetarian, but includes proteinaceous plants and oil seeds beside carbohydrates, tending to decrease in the most prosperous countries where a considerable proportion of the dietary intake is of animal origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hence the possibility that the disease is caused by one or more of the numerous plant toxins which most, if not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, plants produce to defend themselves against their predators and parasites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The geographical distribution of cerebrovascular disease seems best matched by that of the consumption of leguminous plants, notably soya beans </plain></SENT>
