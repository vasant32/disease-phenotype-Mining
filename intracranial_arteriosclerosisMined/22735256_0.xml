<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because of its nonspecific presentation and difficulties in making a positive diagnosis, empiric treatment is often instituted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE SERIES: We report a case series of 5 patients who were admitted or transferred to the Johns Hopkins Hospital with a clinical history and magnetic resonance imaging findings suggestive of PCNSV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four patients had received at least 1 course of immunosuppression with high-dose intravenous (IV) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> and/or a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi>-sparing agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each underwent an extensive workup including 4-vessel cerebral angiography and, in the majority of cases, brain biopsy to evaluate for mimics of PCNSV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In each of the 5 cases, an alternative diagnosis was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We propose a cautious, multistep approach to the diagnosis of PCNSV, which takes into account more common diagnoses and avoids the pitfalls of empiric treatment </plain></SENT>
