<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ten patients with ischemic symptoms referable to stenotic intracranial atherosclerotic arteries, with greater than 60% stenosis, underwent elective surgery in which a primary stent was placed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent pretreatment (&gt; or =1 week) combination oral antiplatelet (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi> and aspirin) therapy and long-term (6-month) combination oral antiplatelet (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi> and aspirin) therapy after stents were placed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The procedure involved selecting stents of the same size as the diameter of the target vessel and slowly inflating the balloon to its nominal pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One-year angiography and midterm clinical follow-up data were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The stents were successfully placed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients without any perioperative complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean preoperative stenosis rate of 81% decreased to 4% after the stent was placed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nine patients who underwent follow-up angiography (one patient refused) at a mean of 12.3 months (range 10-19 months) had no changes in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> diameter compared with the immediate postoperative <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">Luminal</z:chebi> narrowing increased, from 15 to 38%, in one case in which there was comparatively greater residual stenosis (15%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No patient suffered new ischemic symptoms during a mean clinical follow-up period of 21 months (range 12-36 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Elective stent surgery can provide good angiographic and clinical midterm outcomes in patients with symptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis, and the procedure is associated with a high degree of technical success </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Reassessment of these promising results is needed in a larger population and in a randomized prospective comparison study </plain></SENT>
