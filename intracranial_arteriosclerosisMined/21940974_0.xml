<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Limited data are available concerning the outcome of angioplasty/stenting for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> atherosclerotic intracranial <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, which is often associated with progressive symptom development in the salvageable brain under ischemic threat due to poor collateral blood supply </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Among 177 patients who underwent angioplasty and/or stenting for severe symptomatic intracranial steno-occlusion, 26 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> atherosclerotic intracranial <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Outcome after stenting (N=22) was assessed according to procedural success (return of antegrade flow and residual stenosis&lt;50%), adverse event (any <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>) rate, and restenosis (&gt;50%) using weighted Cox proportional hazards regression in the overall cohort and in separate subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Successful recanalization was achieved in 95% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three adverse events (13.6%) occurred among patients undergoing stenting for occlusion, including 2 major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> and 1 nonprocedure-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Good outcome (modified Rankin Scaleâ‰¤2) was achieved in 73% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the overall cohort, no significant difference was observed between the occlusion and stenosis groups in terms of the risk of adverse events (hazard ratio for the occlusion group, 1.055; 95% CI, 0.29-3.90) or the risk of restenosis (hazard ratio for the occlusion group, 1.2; 95% CI, 0.19-7.72) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A trend toward a higher rate of adverse events was observed in older age (&gt;65 years), progressive worsening, balloon-expandable stent, and no history of a preprocedural P2Y12 assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In a cohort of patients undergoing angioplasty/stenting for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> atherosclerotic intracranial <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, no significant difference in the rates of adverse events was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, several factors, including age, tended to be associated with a higher event rate </plain></SENT>
