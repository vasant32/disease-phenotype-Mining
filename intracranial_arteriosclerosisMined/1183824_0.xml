<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This sign was thought to be due to the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> brain damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nosetip temperatures were compared with forehead and ambient temperatures in 400 patients until recovery, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or transfer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Weekly readings were taken, and may have failed to give an accurate record in those observed for 4 weeks or less, though here 56% of the 154 fatalities had low nosetip temperatures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A longer-stay group consisted of 177 cases, of whom 155 had low nosetip temperatures at some time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>87 patients in this group died, 43 remained disabled and only 25 regained their previous state of health </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that low nosetip temperatures provide a useful indicator that adequate recovery is unlikely to occur </plain></SENT>
