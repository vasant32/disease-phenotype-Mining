<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Seventy-two patients with intracranial stenosis (≥ 50%) were treated using an undersized (group U) or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-sized (group N) Gateway(™) balloon and a Wingspan(™) stent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were successfully stented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Stenosis improved from 74.2% before treatment to 23.8% immediately after treatment in group U and from 70.9% to 20.1% in group N </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The two groups had similar rates of major periprocedural neurological complications (9.0% overall), none of which led to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Residual stenosis at follow-up was 40.8% and 32.5% in groups U and N, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In-stent re-stenosis (ISR) was significantly less frequent in group N (22.0%) than in group U (33.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that use of a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-sized Gateway(™) balloon and Wingspan(™) stent appears to be safe, to have a high rate of technical success, good immediate post-operative results and a low ISR rate </plain></SENT>
