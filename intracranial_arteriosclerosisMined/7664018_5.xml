<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Prospective open clinical study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 2,590 patients with 5,180 carotid arteries were scanned, 4,560 were initially analysed in terms of symptoms but 54 were excluded, leaving a total of 4,258 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Localising symptoms were present with respect to 1,342 vessels (29.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two-thirds of symptomatic patients had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Tight stenosis (80-99%) was more likely to be associated with symptoms than low-grade (20-79%) stenosis (chi 2 = 28.0, p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Plaque type was identified in 1,558 bifurcations (36.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>Heterogeneous</z:hpo> type I &amp; II plaques accounted for one third of plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a relationship between plaque <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and degree of stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At &lt; 20% stenosis only 4.4% of plaques were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> whereas at 80-99% stenosis 84.5% of plaques were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100576'>Amaurosis fugax</z:hpo> was the only symptom that had any association with a particular plaque <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Seventy-two percent of plaques associated with this symptom were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> in nature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Carotid plaque <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and degree of internal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> are mutually dependent factors and both reflect the severity of atherosclerotic disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Plaque <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> does not add to the sensitivity of stenosis in predicting the presence of symptoms </plain></SENT>
