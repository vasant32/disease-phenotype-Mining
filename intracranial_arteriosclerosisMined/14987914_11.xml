<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the association of thrombogenic and inflammatory profiles in patients who have suffered a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study involved 17 patients with atherothrombotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and 34 healthy subjects as control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients were examined 48 h, 3 and 6 months after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To determine the inflammatory and thrombogenic profiles, plasma levels of fibrinogen, total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26667">sialic acid</z:chebi> (TSA), C-reactive protein (CRP), tissue factor (TF) and fibrin D-dimer (D-dimer) were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The study showed that at 48 h and 3 months the levels of fibrinogen, TF, D-dimer, TSA and CRP were significantly higher than control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>TF, D-dimer and TSA remains significantly elevated throughout the entire study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>TF and D-dimer decreased over time without reaching the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The multiple regression analysis showed that, at 48 h, 68% of the variance of fibrinogen and 22% of the variance of TF could be explained by the influence of CRP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At 3 and 6 months, 78% of the variance of fibrinogen could be explained by the influence of TSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest a relation among <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> markers, fibrinogen and TF in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>As TF and D-dimer are still elevated at 6 months, an increased thrombogenicity for a longer period following the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> event is present </plain></SENT>
