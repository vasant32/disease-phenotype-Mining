<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to determine accuracy of transcranial Doppler screening at laboratories that share the same standardized scanning protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> were prospectively studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Outcomes and Neuroimaging of Intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>Atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (SONIA) criteria were used for identification of ≥50% stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We determined velocity cutoffs for ≥70% stenosis on digital subtraction angiography by <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">Warfarin</z:chebi>-Aspirin Symptomatic Intracranial Disease criteria and evaluated novel stenotic/prestenotic ratio and low-velocity criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 102 patients with intracranial atherosclerotic disease (age 57±13 years; 72% men; median National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale 3, interquartile range 6) provided 690 transcranial Doppler/digital subtraction angiography vessel pairs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On digital subtraction angiography, ≥50% stenosis was found in 97 and ≥70% stenosis in 62 arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Predictive values for transcranial Doppler SONIA criteria were similar (P&gt;0.9) between middle cerebral artery (sensitivity 78%, specificity 93%, positive predictive value 73%, negative predictive value 94%, and overall accuracy 90%) and vertebral artery/basilar artery (69%, 98%, 88%, 93%, and 92%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As a single velocity criterion, most sensitive mean flow velocity thresholds for ≥70% stenosis were: middle cerebral artery&gt;120 cm/s (71%) and vertebral artery/basilar artery&gt;110 cm/s (55%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Optimal combined criteria for ≥70% stenosis were: middle cerebral artery&gt;120 cm/s, or stenotic/prestenotic ratio≥3, or low velocity (sensitivity 91%, specificity 80%, receiver operating characteristic 0.858), and vertebral artery/basilar artery&gt;110 cm/s or stenotic/prestenotic ratio≥3 (60%, 95%, 0.769, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: At laboratories with a standardized scanning protocol, SONIA mean flow velocity criteria remain reliably predictive of ≥50% stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Novel velocity/ratio criteria for ≥70% stenosis increased sensitivity and showed good agreement with invasive angiography </plain></SENT>
