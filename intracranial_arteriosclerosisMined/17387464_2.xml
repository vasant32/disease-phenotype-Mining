<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Previously, endovascular treatment of stenosis related to intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (ICAD) involving arteries measuring less than 2 mm in diameter was limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, there are no reports in the literature addressing stent placement for treatment of stenosis in arteries of this size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Four patients aged 33 to 80 years (mean 57.5 years) with medically refractory ICAD underwent angioplasty and stenting of small (&lt;2 mm) distal intracerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Vessel location and length of follow-up were anterior cerebral artery (ACA) A1 segment (5 months), ACA A2 segment (18 months), middle cerebral artery M1 segment (18 months), and posterior cerebral artery P1 segment (8 months) with vessel calibers ranging from 1.2 to 1.8 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical and imaging follow-up ranged from 5 to 18 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> procedures were successfully performed without complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Follow-up out to 18 months demonstrated one vessel that went on to occlusion while the other stented vessel segments remained patent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One patient died 8 months after stenting, but the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was not related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The remaining patients experienced resolution of the presenting symptomatology and remained asymptomatic throughout follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In this small series, stenoses of distal (&lt;2 mm) cerebral arteries were amenable to treatment using new self-expanding stents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We safely and successfully treated four arteries smaller than 2 mm in diameter with newer self-expanding stents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients remained clinically asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>One stent occluded at 5 months and the others remained patent during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Longer term clinical follow-up is required to determine the durability and viability of this therapy </plain></SENT>
