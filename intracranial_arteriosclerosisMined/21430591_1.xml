<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate early recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> rates in a cohort of patients with symptomatic &gt;50% intracranial stenosis in whom intracranial angioplasty and stent placement was initially deferred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients presenting to 2 academic hospitals with symptomatic intracranial disease between 2006 and 2008 who underwent catheter angiography were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with complete intracranial occlusion or stenosis less than 50% stenosis were excluded (n = 14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-one patients met the study criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sixteen (52%) patients were on antiplatelet medications at the time of the initial event, and 2 patients were also on <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> medications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Six patients (19%) underwent intracranial angioplasty and/or stent placement with their initial diagnostic angiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five patients (81%) had endovascular treatment deferred for best medical treatment in the interim period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among the 25 patients who were kept on medical management, 14 (56%) were readmitted with recurrent ischemic events in the distribution of the target artery within a median of 28 days (range, 1-243 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Recurrent events occurred within 1 week in 8 (57%) patients, between 7 days and 1 month in 4 (29%) patients, 1 to 3 months in 1 (7%) patient, and after 3 months in 1 (7%) patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Recurrent ischemic events were observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 5 patients with basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> and in 13 of 17 patients with severity of stenosis â‰¥ 70% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A high rate of recurrent ischemic events was observed among patients in whom endovascular treatment was deferred, particularly those with basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> and those with high-grade stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This information would be beneficial in decision making for timing of the endovascular treatment among patients with symptomatic intracranial stenosis </plain></SENT>
