<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several characteristic population-specific clinical phenotypes and neuroimaging features have been reported in CADASIL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study investigated the clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> presentation and cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings in a group of patients with CADASIL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We reviewed the clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> presentation and brain MRI findings in 73 consecutive Korean patients aged &gt;18 years diagnosed with CADASIL between May 2004 and April 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Brain MRI images were also scored for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> and cerebral microbleeds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (ICAS) was assessed by magnetic resonance angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Disability was measured with the modified Rankin scale (mRS) and classified as good (mRS score 0-2) or poor (mRS score 3-5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In this study, 65 of the 73 patients (90.3%) had the same R544C genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A total of 40 episodes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> were confirmed in 31 patients, with a mean age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of 58.8 Â± 11.4 years (range, 38-76 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients (16.9%) had ICAS, and 5 of these patients had symptomatic stenoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>Intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> occurred in 9 patients (12.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Both <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> and ICAS were associated with poor clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
