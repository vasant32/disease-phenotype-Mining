<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: Patients with intracranial vertebrobasilar artery (VBA) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0543822" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">atherosclerotic occlusive disease</z:e> have few therapeutic options </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, VBA <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo>) herald a lethal or devastating event within 5 years in 25 to 30% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors report their initial experience with eight patients in whom medically refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> secondary to intracranial posterior circulation atherosclerotic occlusive lesions were treated with stent-assisted angioplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eight patients (six men), ranging in age from 43 to 77 years, experienced signs and symptoms of VBA insufficiency despite combination therapy with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> and antiplatelet agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Angiographic studies revealed severe distal vertebral (four patients), proximal basilar (one patient), or proximal and midbasilar stenoses (three patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Aspirin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37941">clopidogrel</z:chebi> were administered for 3 days before primary angioplasty and stent placement, and this regimen was maintained by the patients on discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients underwent heparinization during the procedure and were given a bolus and 12-hour infusion of abciximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A neurologist specializing in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> evaluated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients before and after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The VBAs in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were successfully revascularized with 7 to 28% residual stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Six patients experienced no neurological complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One patient died the evening of the procedure due to a massive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Two patients had groin <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematomas</z:mp>, one developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo>, and one had transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> surviving patients are asymptomatic up to 8 months postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although primary intracranial VBA angioplasty with stent insertion is technically feasible, complications associated with the procedure can be life threatening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>As experience is gained with this procedure, it may be offered routinely as an alternative therapy to patients with medically refractory posterior circulation occlusive disease that may develop into catastrophic VBA insufficiency </plain></SENT>
