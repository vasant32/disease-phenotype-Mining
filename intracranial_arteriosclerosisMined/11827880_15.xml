<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography is primarily and increasingly used to assess intracranial arterial stenoocclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography can cause overestimation of stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although CT angiography is accurate, it has limitations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our purpose was to determine whether the accuracy of combined <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography and CT angiography is equal to that of digital subtraction angiography (DSA) in measuring stenosis and detecting major intracranial <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: CT angiography and intraarterial DSA were prospectively performed in 18 patients with suspected intracranial stenoocclusive disease, as revealed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Before DSA, two reviewers independently assessed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> intracranial angiograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, they assessed CT angiograms with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results were compared with DSA results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The degree of stenoocclusion was categorized; stenosis of 50% or more indicated stenoocclusive disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After the blinded study, two radiologists retrospectively reviewed the angiographic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Stenoocclusive disease was identified in 18 of 198 intracranial arteries at DSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography had a sensitivity of 92%, a specificity of 91%, and an accuracy of 91% for the identification of stenosis of 50% or more; the addition of CT angiography yielded values of 100%, 99%, and 99%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Stenotic grades with combined CT angiography and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography agreed with those of DSA in 98% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In the retrospective study, CT angiography did not always correctly delineate arterial lumina with circumferential calcification and cavernous portions of the internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In this investigation, the evaluation of suspected stenoocclusive diseases in major intracranial arteries, the accuracy of combined <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography and CT angiography is equal to that of DSA in most cases </plain></SENT>
