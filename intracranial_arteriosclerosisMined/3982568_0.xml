<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The determination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoproteins</z:chebi> should be preferred to the determination of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39027">VLDL</z:chebi>, which has been practised so far </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A reduced <z:chebi fb="16" ids="53704">APO</z:chebi>-L A/B quotient was also observed in more than 70% of 62 CVD patients whose cholesterol level was within the range of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
