<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The ankle-brachial blood pressure index (ABI) is an established clinical test for assessment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>peripheral arterial disease</z:hpo> and an indicator of generalized <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether low ABI is associated with long-term functional outcome in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We included 775 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> who were admitted within 7 days from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and had completed an ABI measurement during admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Poor functional outcome was defined as a modified Rankin Scale of more than 2 at three months from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The association between low ABI and poor functional outcome was analyzed using logistic regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A low ABI (&lt;0.9) was present in 10.1% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At three months from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, 16.9% of patients showed poor functional outcome (mRS &gt; 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for conventional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> and the presence of cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, a low ABI was independently associated with poor functional outcome (odds ratio 2.523, 95% CI 1.330-4.785, p = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The presence of a low ABI was associated with an increased risk of poor functional outcome in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Screening for low ABI among <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients may be necessary to identify individuals at increased risk of poor functional outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Proper and individualized treatment for patients with a low ABI may improve long-term functional outcome following <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
