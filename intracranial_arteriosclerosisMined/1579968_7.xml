<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim in the present study was to determine whether the level of prior cigarette use is a significant predictor of carotid artery plaque thickness when age, history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> are controlled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied a continuous sample of 790 patients with a history of smoking referred for diagnostic ultrasound imaging of the carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects (mean age 61 years) had an average of 51 pack-years of cigarette use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>History of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> was present in 44% and history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in 18% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Right and left maximum carotid artery plaque thicknesses were averaged for each patient; the average of this value for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 790 subjects was 1.9 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In bivariate analysis, age (p less than 0.0001), pack-years (p less than 0.0001), history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (p = 0.0003), and history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (p = 0.037) were each positively associated with carotid artery plaque thickness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In multiple regression analysis, age (p less than 0.0001), pack-years (p = 0.0005), and history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (p = 0.0044) were statistically significant independent predictors of carotid artery plaque thickness, but history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (p = 0.2451) was not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In smokers, the level of cigarette use is associated with an acceleration of carotid artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This effect is independent of age, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results support smoking abatement as an important element to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> prevention in clinical practice </plain></SENT>
