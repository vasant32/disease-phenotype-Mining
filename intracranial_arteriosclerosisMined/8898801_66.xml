<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to assess the influence of race, sex, and other risk factors on the location of atherosclerotic occlusive lesions in cerebral vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous angiographic studies of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>) suggest that extracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> is more common in whites and intracranial disease is more common in blacks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Noninvasive techniques such as duplex ultrasound, transcranial Doppler (TCD), and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) allow vascular assessment of a more representative proportion of patients than does conventional angiography alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive patients evaluated at a community hospital for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> over a 2-year period were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lesions were defined as a 50% or greater atherosclerotic stenosis by angiography, duplex ultrasound, or TCD, or a moderate stenosis by MRA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Whites were more likely than blacks to have extracranial carotid artery lesions (33% versus 15%, P = .001), but the proportion of patients with intracranial lesions was similar (24% versus 22%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Men were more likely to have intracranial lesions than women (29% versus 14%, P = .03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When multivariate logistic regression analysis was used, white race was the only predictor for extracranial carotid artery lesions, and male sex was the only predictor for intracranial lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> was extracranial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery disease</z:e> in 8% and intracranial disease in 8% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The distribution of cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> is influenced by race and sex but not by other vascular risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In our patient population, intracranial disease is as common a cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> as extracranial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0741975" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
