<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>iaDSA is the current criterion standard examination after ICAS for the detection of ISR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we evaluated ivACT as a potential noninvasive follow-up alternative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 17 cases, ivACT and iaDSA were performed after ICAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both procedures were carried out on a flat-panel-detector-equipped angiography system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Postprocessing of ivACT acquisitions was performed on a dedicated workstation producing multiplanar reformations of the stent region and other intracranial arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Restenotic lesions were compared with iaDSA measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> studies were independently evaluated by 2 experienced neuroradiologists blinded to patients data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 5 cases, ISR was diagnosed on iaDSA images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> restenotic lesions were reliably detected (sensitivity, 100%; 95%CI, 48%-100%) and could be correctly quantified on ivACT images in comparison with iaDSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The neuroradiologists correctly excluded ISR in 11 of 12 lesions after viewing the ivACT examinations (specificity, 92%; 95%CI, 62%-100%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Measurements of ISR on ivACT were highly correlated to iaDSA (Pearson r = 0.94, P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: IvACT is a promising noninvasive follow-up examination after ICAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>With its high spatial resolution, it can reliably detect or exclude ISR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Contrary to iaDSA, there is no need for a recovery period after ivACT and the risk of neurologic complications is practically lowered to zero </plain></SENT>
