<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: There is limited data of neurovascular coupling on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients, especially on comparison of different etiologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aim to test the hypothesis that patients with small vessel disease (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e>) are impaired on neurovascular coupling rather than <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patient with large intracranial <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> (LIAS), because small vessel is more associated with microcirculatory function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To assess microcirculatory integrity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients, we performed a functional transcranial Doppler test using a standardized visual stimulation test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The neurovascular coupling was measured in the asymptomatic occipital cortex in ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with LIAS, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e>, and healthy elder controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Bilateral posterior cerebral arteries were monitored to measure evoked flow velocity during resting and visual stimulation phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Peak systolic flow velocity responses were recorded, and time course of hemodynamic response was modeled according to a control system analysis with the parameters gain, natural angular frequency, attenuation, and rate time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Reproduced for both sides, the functionally induced flow velocity changes (gain) were significantly lower in LIAS and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> compared with controls (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Reductions in both <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> groups were in the same order </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neurovascular coupling in LIAS group did not show difference at the side of vessel stenosis compared with non-stenosis side or at different stenotic degrees </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Interestingly, both LIAS and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> showed an uncoupling of the blood supply of active neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This points to an additional small vessel dysfunction in patients with LIAS </plain></SENT>
