<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 39 patients received treatments with wingspan stents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> had neurological symptoms attributable to intracranial stenoses (â‰¥ 50%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The investigators evaluated the effect of clinical manifestations and imaging features on the safety and long-term results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, 38 were successfully stented during a treatment session </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only one had postprocedural hyperperfusion injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>And 24 patients underwent digital subtraction angiography or magnetic resonance angiography follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among them, 8 patients were of in-stent restenosis (ISR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>And 3 had clinical symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The average length of vascular lesions was 15.3mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>And the patients whose length of vascular lesions was above 15.3mm had much higher rates of ISR (67% vs 13%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The average ratio of reference vessel diameter to stent diameter was 0.78 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>And the patients whose ratio was less than 0.78 had much higher rates of ISR (60% vs 14%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Intracranial angioplasty with wingspan stents may be performed to treat small intracranial vessels with a relatively high degree of safety </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The rate of ISR is relatively high and a majority of patients stay asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
