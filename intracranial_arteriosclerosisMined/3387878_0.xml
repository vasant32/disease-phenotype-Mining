<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The areas with mucoid <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> appeared as adequate sites for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of fatty streaks; the areas with swelling <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> appeared as adequate sites for a diffuse extracellular retention of tiny <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> droplets; the areas with dissecting <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> appeared as adequate sites for large fatty deposits rich in cholesterol clefts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results of this paper demonstrate that human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> has many attributes of a necrotizing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arteriopathy</z:e> and that <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> accumulation is a secondary phenomenon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results add support to the insudative theory of atherogenesis built up by German pathologists at the middle of this century and disagree with the often repeated view that human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> is a reaction of the arterial wall to <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> that invade it </plain></SENT>
