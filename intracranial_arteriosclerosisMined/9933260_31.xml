<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The estimated prevalence of intracranial atherosclerotic disease (IAD) in patients with stenosis of the extracranial internal carotid artery (ICA) varies between 20% and 50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The benefits of carotid endarterectomy (CE) in patients with both IAD and symptomatic extracranial ICA stenosis are uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The association between IAD and other vascular risk factors and with the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> at 3 years were studied in patients with symptomatic extracranial ICA stenosis who participated in the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Since the NASCET protocol excluded severe IAD, only a modest number of patients in this category could be studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: IAD was observed in one third of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In medically treated patients, the relative risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> associated with IAD varied from 1.3 (95% CI, 0.9 to 1.9) with extracranial ICA stenosis of &lt;50% to 1.8 (95% CI, 1.1 to 3.2) with 85% to 99% ICA stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, IAD did not affect the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> among surgically treated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To prevent 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> ipsilateral to the symptomatic ICA stenosis over 3 years in patients who have also IAD, 12 patients with 50% to 69%, 5 patients with 70% to 84%, and 3 patients with 85% to 99% ICA stenosis have to undergo CE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In patients without IAD these numbers are 26, 7, and 6, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: IAD is an independent risk factor for subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in medically treated patients with symptomatic ICA stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CE reduces this risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The additional risk imposed by IAD in medically treated patients enhances the value of CE in patients with moderate symptomatic extracranial ICA stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Detection of IAD, requiring angiography, is an important prelude to planning CE in symptomatic patients with moderate extracranial ICA stenosis </plain></SENT>
