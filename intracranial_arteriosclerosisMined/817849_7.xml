<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The interrelationships between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> were investigated in a subhuman primate model (cynomolgus monkey) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> produced by surgically coarcting the miathoracic aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The hypertensive coarcted monkey fed a low cholesterol diet for 6 months did not develop complicating <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> but did develop focal intimal lesions as well as marked thickening of the musculoelastic media of both the large and small arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fibrocellular thickening of the intima and media occurred in the vessels proximal to the coarctation but not distal to the coarctation suggesting that a high level of blood pressure with resulting increase in arterial wall tension is responsible for these changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The hypertensive coarcted monkey fed a hypercholesterolemic diet (2% cholesterol and 10% butter) for 6 months developed severe coronary atherosclerotic disease with fibrous plaque formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The disease produced over 65% <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> narrowing of the major coronary arteries and their extramural and intramural branches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast the noncoarcted normotensive animal fed the same diet developed mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> of only the major coronary arteries which caused an average <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> narrowing of 12% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Aggravation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> also appeared to occur in the other arteries above the coarctation particularly the cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When the hypertensive coarcted monkey with preestablished <z:hpo ids='HP_0004929'>coronary atherosclerosis</z:hpo> was treated with a low cholesterol diet and a combination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive drugs</z:chebi> (hydrochlorothiazide, hydralazine, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28487">reserpine</z:chebi>), the progression of the disease was arrested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There also was evidence that treatment caused some regression of the coronary lesions which appeared to "heal" by <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The treatment of both <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> appeared to be more effective than the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo>, alone </plain></SENT>
