<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To identify procedure-related factors that may affect patient safety and technical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this prospective study of 57 consecutive patients, the primary end points were intraprocedural technical problems, periprocedure morbidity, and complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Major periprocedure complication was defined as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> at 30 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Technical failure was defined as the inability to complete the procedure because of technical or safety problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Procedure failure was defined as a procedure outcome of technical failure or major periprocedure complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Secondary end points were procedure-related factors that may affect patient safety and technical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Procedure failure rate was 12.3% (7/57) (major periprocedure complication rate, 5.3% [3/57]; technical failure rate, 7% [4/57]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Initial failure in tracking of balloon or stent occurred in 20 patients, other technical problems occurred in 11 patients, including kinking or trapping of balloon catheter (2 cases), difficulty in unsheathing of stent (3 cases), forward migration of stent during deployment (4 cases), trapping of nose cone after stent deployment (1 case), fracture of delivery system (2 cases), and guidewire fracture (1 case) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Unfavorable vascular <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> signified by the presence of 2 or more reverse curves along the access path was found to associate with initial failure in the tracking of instruments (OR = âˆž), and occurrence of other technical problems (OR = 25) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Procedure-related factors could be identified and lead to improvements in patient safety and technical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Tortuous vascular <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> is a key factor to be overcome </plain></SENT>
