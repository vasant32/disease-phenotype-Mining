<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Arteriosclerotic plaques were usually semi-circular (77%), of high amplitude (64%) and homogeneous (80%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ulcerating plaques were correctly diagnosed in only three out of eight cases demonstrated angiographically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>So far there has been no definite relationship between the appearance of the plaques and clinical symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared with arteriography (170 examinations) the specificity of sonography was 98% (62/63), the sensitivity for plaques was 100% (50/50), for stenoses it was 63% (5/8) to 93% (14/15), for occlusions it was 76% (13/17) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The indications and drawbacks of the method are discussed </plain></SENT>
