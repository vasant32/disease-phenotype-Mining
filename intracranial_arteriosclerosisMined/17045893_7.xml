<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: We sought to investigate the role of the CXC chemokine neutrophil-activating <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>-2 (NAP-2) in atherogenesis and plaque destabilization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Chemokines are involved in atherogenesis, but the role of NAP-2 in atherosclerotic disorders is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Based on its potential pro-atherogenic properties, we hypothesized a pathogenic role for NAP-2 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We tested this hypothesis by differential experimental approaches including studies in patients with stable (n = 40) and unstable <z:mp ids='MP_0006112'>angina</z:mp> (n = 40) and healthy control subjects (n = 20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The following results were discovered: 1) patients with stable, and particularly those with unstable, <z:mp ids='MP_0006112'>angina</z:mp> had markedly raised plasma levels of NAP-2 compared with control subjects, accompanied by increased expression of CXC receptor 2 in monocytes; 2) platelets, but also peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), released large amounts of NAP-2 upon stimulation, with a particularly prominent PBMC response in unstable <z:mp ids='MP_0006112'>angina</z:mp>; 3) NAP-2 protein was detected in macrophages and smooth muscle cells of atherosclerotic plaques and in monocytes and platelets of coronary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e>; 4) in vitro, recombinant and platelet-derived NAP-2 increased the expression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules and chemokines in endothelial cells; and 5) whereas aspirin reduced plasma levels of NAP-2, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> therapy increased NAP-2 with stimulating effects both on platelets and leukocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that NAP-2 has the potential to induce <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory responses</z:mp> within the atherosclerotic plaque </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By its ability to promote leukocyte and endothelial cell activation, such a NAP-2-driven <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> could promote plaque rupture and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> coronary syndromes </plain></SENT>
