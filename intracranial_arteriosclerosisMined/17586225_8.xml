<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Early detection of vulnerable plaques at risk of causing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> is very important, and many investigators report the usefulness of high-resolution MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine whether the detection of atherosclerotic carotid plaques can be enhanced after administration of contrast agents and, if so, to evaluate the potential for functional information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 9 patients (10 subjects) who underwent a high-resolution MRI examination using a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi>-based contrast agent before CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pre- and postcontrast-enhanced T1-weighted images were reviewed, and their histopathologic characteristics evaluated in the corresponding tissue slices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Strong contrast enhancement patterns were found in 6 of 10 subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For 5 of 6 subjects, many microvessels with inflammatory cells or intraplaque <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> were demonstrated in their corresponding tissue slices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Contrast enhancement patterns were noted to be focal, diffuse, and along the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> surface or the vessel adventitial boundary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, some plaques were clearly demonstrated by using contrast agent, and others were clearly divided into fibrous and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">Gadolinium</z:chebi>-based contrast agent can penetrate human atherosclerotic carotid plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The extent or size of neovascularization and the endothelial permeability are likely related to the mechanism of enhancement, and contrast-enhanced MRI may be essential for the identification of plaque neovascularization which is an important factor of vulnerable plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition to morphologic information, with the functional information provided using various contrast agents, we may expect a more correct diagnosis of carotid plaques at risk of causing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
