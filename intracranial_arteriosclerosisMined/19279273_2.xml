<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Patients with symptomatic atherosclerotic stenosis of the intracranial vertebrobasilar artery (VBA) have a poor prognosis, and those with coexistent intracranial and extracranial stenoses have worse outcomes despite medical therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to study the long-term outcome of patients with symptomatic atherosclerotic tandem stenoses at the intracranial VBA and the vertebral artery ostium (VAO) after elective stent placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten consecutive patients (mean age, 65.3 years) with this condition underwent elective stent placement at our institution between September 2001 and December 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Technical success was defined as stent placement of both VAO and intracranial VBA stenoses with complete stent coverage of the lesions, residual stenosis of &lt; or = 30%, and good antegrade blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The study end point was a composite of any <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> within 30 days and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in the VBA territory after 30 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Technical success was obtained in 9 of 10 patients without any <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> within 30 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During a median follow-up duration of 32 months, 1 patient had a fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in the VBA territory at 4 months, and the other 9 patients were free from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, the annual <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate in VBA territory (including any <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> within 30 days) was 3.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study shows that elective stent placement for patients with symptomatic atherosclerotic tandem stenoses at the intracranial VBA and VAO has an acceptable long-term outcome and may be considered as an alternative to medical therapy </plain></SENT>
