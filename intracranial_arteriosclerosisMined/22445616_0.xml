<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although cigarette smoking has been established as an important risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, the effect on the atherosclerotic stenosis, which are based on observational studies, have been controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We set out to examine the differences in the risk factors between smokers and nonsmokers and to investigate the association of cigarette smoking with cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0100545'>arterial stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 989 consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> noncardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> were prospectively enrolled from June 2004 to January 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The risk factor profiles were compared between smokers and nonsmokers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the degree of stenosis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> MRA, and evaluated influencing factors in the patients with intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (ICAS) and extracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (ECAS) who were randomly matched by age and sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were differences in the distribution of risk factors between the 467 (70.0%) nonsmokers and the 215 (30.0%) smokers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nonsmokers were older (71.7±11.0 versus 61.7±12.0, p&lt;0.001) and had a higher frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> than smokers had (75.4% versus 64.0%, p=0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When smokers and nonsmokers were age- and sex-matched, smoking was more prevalent in patients with ICAS than with ECAS (32.9% versus 28.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Conditional regression analysis revealed that smoking and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> increased the odds of ICAS [smoking, odds ratio (OR): 1.83, p=0.026; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, OR: 1.84, p=0.01], whereas <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo> increased the odds of ECAS (OR: 1.87, p=0.034) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The distributions of the major risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> were different between smokers and nonsmokers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Cigarette smoking may be more associated with ICAS than with ECAS after adjusting for potential risk factors </plain></SENT>
