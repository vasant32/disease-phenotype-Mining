<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The levels of dynamics and comparative clinical relevance of crioglobulinemia in patients of the both groups have been evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Crioglobulines (CG) in the peripheral blood serum were determined at 1, 2, 3, 7th and 14th days after the disease development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the 1st day, the elevated CG level similar in the both groups as well as similarity of crioglobulinemia dynamics in whole was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the group A, but not in the group B, the CG level was directly correlated with disease severity (p&lt;0,05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the group B, there was a trend, which depended on the blood CG level on the 1st day of the disease and on the presence of previous stenocardia (p&lt;0,1) </plain></SENT>
