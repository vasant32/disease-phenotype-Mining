<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We sought to compare the clinical outcomes between primary angioplasty and stent placement for symptomatic intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical and angiographic data of 190 patients treated with 95 primary angioplasty procedures and 98 intracranial stent placements (total of 193 procedures) in 3 tertiary care centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> and combined <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were identified as primary clinical end points during the periprocedural and follow-up period of 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The rates of significant postoperative residual stenosis (&gt;/=50% of greater stenosis immediately after the procedure) and binary restenosis (&gt;/=50% stenosis at follow-up angiography within 3 years) were also compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The comparative analysis was performed after adjusting for age, sex, and center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fourteen procedures in the angioplasty-treated group (15%) and 4 in the stent-treated group (4.1%) had significant postoperative residual stenosis (relative risk [RR]=2.8, 95% CI, 0.85 to 9.5, P=0.09, for the adjusted model) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were 3 periprocedural <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (1.5%), 1 in the angioplasty group (1.1%) and 2 in the stent-treated group (2.0%) and 14 periprocedural <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> (7.3%), 7 periprocedural <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> in each group (7.4% and 7.1%, respectively; hazard ratio=1.1; 95% CI, 0.57 to 1.9, P=0.85) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Angiographic follow-up was available for 134 procedures (66 angioplasty-treated and 68 stent-treated cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Forty-eight procedures (36.1%) had evidence of binary restenosis (25 of 66 angioplasties, 23 of 68 stents, P=0.85) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Binary restenosis-free survival at 12 months was 68% for the angioplasty-treated group and 64% for the stent-treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in follow-up survival (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>) between the angioplasty-treated and the stent-treated groups (hazard ratio=0.54; 95% CI, 0.11 to 2.5, P=0.44 and hazard ratio=0.50; 95%, CI 0.17 to 1.5, P=0.22, respectively, after adjusting for age, sex, and center) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>- and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>-free survival at 2 years for the angioplasty-treated group and the stent-treated group was 92+/-4% and 89+/-5%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Stent treatment for intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> may lower the rate of significant postoperative residual stenosis compared with primary angioplasty alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No benefit of stent placement over primary angioplasty in reducing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> could be identified in this study </plain></SENT>
