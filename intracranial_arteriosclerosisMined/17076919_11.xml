<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> is regarded as a subtype of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, especially in, but not entirely restricted to, the elderly, characterized by a specific clinical presentation and an association with (cerebro)vascular risk and disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It could have major implications for treatment if subjects at risk for such a <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> could be easily identified by their clinical presentation in general practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: We studied the symptom profile of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> in subjects with and without vascular risk factors in two large Dutch community-based studies, the Rotterdam Study and the Amsterdam Study of the Elderly (AMSTEL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We could not confirm the specific symptom profile in depressed subjects with vascular risk factors in either of the two cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Depressed subjects with vascular risk factors showed more loss of energy and more physical disability than those without vascular risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, presumed specific symptoms of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, namely <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>psychomotor retardation</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0012154'>anhedonia</z:hpo>, were not significantly associated with any of the vascular risk indicators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Loss of energy was significantly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>peripheral arterial disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In these two large community-based studies we identified some differences between vascular and non-vascular depressed subjects but found no evidence for a specific symptom profile of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> as previously defined </plain></SENT>
