<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results were correlated with magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and transcranial color Doppler (TCD) findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 26 patients (13 male and 13 female, age ranged from 46 to 82 years) who presented with symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accidents</z:hpo> had TCD, MRA and MRI assessment of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The TCD and MRA findings of 40 MCAs accessible by TCD were correlated with the ratio of cross-sectional area of the vessel (VA), <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> area of the vessel (LA) and plaque load (PL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The VA ratio and LA showed no correlation with TCD or MRA results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PL however was shown to be associated with both TCD and MRA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: MRI could be used to assess remodeling in <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCAs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>PL was found to be associated with TCD and MRA findings </plain></SENT>
