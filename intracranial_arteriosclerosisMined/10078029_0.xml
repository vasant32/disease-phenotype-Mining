<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Carotid artery ultrasonography (B-mode and Duplex method) was conducted in 49 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Binswanger</z:e>'s <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> (group B) to compare with 189 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e> (group L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>With B-mode method, there was no significant difference in the amount of plaque between group B and group L, but the inner diameter of the common carotid artery was greater in group B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using Duplex method, we measured maximum systolic flow velocity (Max), minimum diastolic flow velocity (Min) and time velocity integral (TVI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that those data were consistently lower in group B than in group L, with a correlation to the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>mental impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The decrease in Max in group B, which has diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo>, indicates a decline in cardiac function, while the decrease in Min indicates an increase of intracranial small vessel resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The lower TVI in group B is thought to reflect a loss of velocity in cerebrovascular circulation due to the decrease in Max and Min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Carotid artery ultrasonography thus proved useful in evaluating the pathogenesis and progression of the disease </plain></SENT>
