<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The trace metals included calcium, <z:chebi fb="70" ids="18291,35154">manganese</z:chebi>, zinc, <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi>, copper and iron </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The American blacks in Washington, D.C., who are ethnologically related to Nigerian Africans, have different patterns of trace metal contents in their cerebral vessels and the observed levels also differed in some respects from Minnesota Caucasians living in a similar environment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The greatest amounts of calcium, zinc, and copper were found in the vessels of American blacks while the greatest amount of <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> was found in vessels of Minnesota Caucasians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no statistically significant difference in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="18291,35154">manganese</z:chebi> content of the cerebral vessels in three population groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nigerian Africans had the least amounts of copper and <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi> but had the highest iron content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A similar high level of iron was observed in the vessels of American blacks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Since it has been shown that American blacks have the most extensive and severe degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> among the three population groups, it would appear that iron, calcium and <z:chebi fb="70" ids="18291,35154">manganese</z:chebi> in the cerebral vessels may not directly relate to the severity of cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Relatively high levels of copper and <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi>, which were observed in the cerebral vessels of American blacks and Caucasians, may be of significance in the pathogenesis of cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The low levels of the trace metals in Nigerians may be protective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The possible role of zinc requires further studies </plain></SENT>
