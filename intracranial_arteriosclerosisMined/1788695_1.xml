<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We found 384 people having plaques, totally 769 pl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>68 p.c. of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> plaques we were found in the femoral arteries, 32 p.c. in the carotid arteries, in each case with preference of the bifurcation and the pre-bifurcation-region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This seems to confirm earlier studies on this theme </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As regards to the <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, we found 67 p.c </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>(of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> plaques) being faintly-echogenic ("fatty-streaks" or intermedi√§r type) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>73 p.c. of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> plaques showed a smooth or faintly irregular surface-character </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>More than 75% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> plaques had a volume less than 0.3 ccm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Altogether, the results verify the assessment of mostly early states of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> with the help of real-time-ultrasound and underline this method being a good and sufficient non-invasive-technique for screening-examinations on an asymptomatic collective </plain></SENT>
