<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 2340 cases of consecutive autopsies of the aged, NBTE was observed in 217 cases or 9.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The age distribution of NBTE revealed a gradual increase with advancing age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The underlying diseases of NBTE were malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> (51.6%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> (28.3%) and other diseases (20.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidence of NBTE in each <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> was high in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007102" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers of the colon</z:e> (16.2%), pancreas (15.2%), gall bladder or bile duct (14.1%) and lung (13.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The vegetations of NBTE were found on the aortic valve in 46.1%, on the mitral valve in 40.6% and on the both valves in 8.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> and scar was 51.2% in the NBTE group, while it was 38.6% in the non-NBTE control group (p less than 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This difference was marked in patients with a small infarction (10.6% vs. 5.3%) and a myocardial scar (30.4% vs. 19.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The grade of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242231" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary stenosis</z:e> was less in the NBTE group than in the control group (p less than 0.001), suggesting that the origin of the myocardial ischemic lesion was embolism from NBTE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The incidence of large <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> was 14.7% in NBTE and 9.2% in the control group, and that of medium sized <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> was 35.0% and 23.6% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In this latter group, cortical infarction comprised 57.9% in the NBTE group and 26.6% in the control group </plain></SENT>
