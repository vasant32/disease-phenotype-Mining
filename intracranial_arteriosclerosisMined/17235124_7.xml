<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Several hereditary small vessel diseases (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVDs</z:e>) of the brain have been reported in recent years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 1977, Sourander and WÃ¥linder described hereditary multi-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (MID) in a Swedish family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the same year, Stevens and colleagues reported <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> familial vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> in an English family bearing a similar phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These disorders have invariably been suggested to be cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arteriopathy</z:e> with subcortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and leucoencephalopathy (CADASIL) but their genetic identities remain unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We used molecular, radiological and neuropathological methods to characterize these disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Direct DNA sequencing unexpectedly confirmed that affected members of the English family carried the R141C mutation in the NOTCH3 gene diagnostic of CADASIL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, we did not detect any pathogenic mutations in the entire 8091 bp reading frame of NOTCH3 or find clear evidence for NOTCH3 gene linkage in the Swedish DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This was consistent with the lack of hyperintense signals in the anterior temporal pole and external capsule in Swedish subjects upon magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We further found no evidence for granular osmiophilic material in skin biopsy or post-mortem brain samples of affected members in the Swedish family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, there was distinct lack of NOTCH3 N-terminal fragments in the cerebral microvasculature of the Swedish hereditary MID subjects compared to the intense accumulation in the English family afflicted with CADASIL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Several differences in arteriosclerotic changes in both the grey and white matter were also noted between the disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The sclerotic index values, density of collagen IV immunoreactivity in the microvasculature and number of perivascular macrophages were greater in the English CADASIL samples compared to those from the Swedish brains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Multiple approaches suggest that the Swedish family with hereditary MID suspected to be CADASIL has a different novel disorder with dissimilar pathological features and belongs to the growing number of genetically uncharacterized familial <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVDs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
