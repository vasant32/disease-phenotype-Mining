<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were operated on a carotid bifurcation stenosis (pre-occlusive) and a thrombectomy with a 3F Fogarty Catheter was carried out in the same time in 3 patients and during re-operation in 1 patient who had post operative <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The carotid-cavernous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> occurred the day after surgery in 2 cases, 1 week after in 1 case, and 2 months later in 1 case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Spontaneous recovery occurred in two patients (1 occlusion--1 re-stenosis), 1 patient died from controlateral carotid occlusion, and 1 patient was lost for investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were no relationship between the number of "repeated passages" of the Fogarty Catheter and the interval time where the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However the location of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> was constant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overtension on the internal wall of the artery by the balloon could be advocated rather than a collateral torn of the intra cavernous internal carotid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Endoluminal treatment of various vascular lesion is increasingly used and iatrogenic problems as reported here should be kept in mind </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Age and atheromatous lesion of carotid siphon appear to be the main risk factors </plain></SENT>
