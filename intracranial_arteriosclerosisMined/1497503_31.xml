<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We performed postmortem magnetic resonance imaging and pathologic examinations on the brains of seven consecutive patients older than 50 years of age who died of non-neurologic causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Multiple hyperintense <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0871456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">subcortical lesions</z:e> were identified in each patient, and a total of 29 lesions were examined histologically (eight rims, six caps, six punctate lesions, and nine patches) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rims were characterized by subependymal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002171'>gliosis</z:hpo> and loss of the ependymal lining; caps were associated with myelin <z:hpo ids='HP_0000980'>pallor</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002171'>gliosis</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo>; punctate lesions were characterized by dilated perivascular spaces and perivascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002171'>gliosis</z:hpo>; and patches were associated with myelin <z:hpo ids='HP_0000980'>pallor</z:hpo> and dilated perivascular spaces </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The pattern of myelin <z:hpo ids='HP_0000980'>pallor</z:hpo> defined the size and shape of caps and patches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>Arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> was identified in six of six caps, three of six punctate lesions, and in three of nine patches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that (1) each type of hyperintense subcortical lesion has a distinct pathologic correlate; (2) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> is not invariably associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> types of hyperintense <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0871456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">subcortical lesions</z:e> on magnetic resonance imaging; and (3) myelin <z:hpo ids='HP_0000980'>pallor</z:hpo> appears to contribute to the magnetic resonance imaging signal at 1.5 tesla </plain></SENT>
