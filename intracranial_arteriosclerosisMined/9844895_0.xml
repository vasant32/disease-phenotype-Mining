<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The following disturbances in central hemodynamics were detected: arterial pressure getting higher, this referring also to the peripheral vascular resistance, hematocrit value, with the bloodflow in the arm-ear portion slowing down, hemodynamics being predominantly of hyperkinetic type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Treatment with cavinton, cavinton plus corglucone resulted in improvement of bloodflow in the affected major brain arteries at the expense of a compensating redistribution of bloodflow from intact collectors to the stenosed arteries basin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Changes in central hemodynamics were manifested by increase in the number of cases presenting with eukinetic-type circulation at the expense of decrease in those of hyperkinetic type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Under hypokinetic type hemodynamics, it is advisable that cavinton be prescribed in combination with cardiac <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24400">glycosides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
