<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The role of aortic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002635'>atheromatosis</z:hpo> as a risk factor for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_118'>systemic embolism</z:mpath> and its relationship to other potential sources of embolism was examined in 335 patients undergoing transoesophageal echocardiography for various clinical reasons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed a significant correlation between embolism and moderate (atheroma protruding less than 5 mm into the aortic lumen, grade 2) to complex (atheroma protruding at least 5 mm into the vessel lumen with or without mobile components, grade 3) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> of the aortic arch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Odds ratios were 4.0 for grade 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002635'>atheromatosis</z:hpo> (95% CI 1.1-14.4; P &lt; 0.05) and 9.7 for grade 3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002635'>atheromatosis</z:hpo> (95% CI 1.5-61.0; P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Other significant associations were found with cardiac <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> (odds ratio 4.0, 95% CI 1.7-9.3; P &lt; 0.005) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (odds ratio 1.8, 95% CI 1.0-3.3; P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a subset of 163 patients in whom results of an ultrasound examination were available, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> of the carotid arteries was another significant marker of embolism (odds ratio 2.0, 95% CI 1.2-3.3; P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, aortic arch <z:hpo ids='HP_0002635'>atheromatosis</z:hpo>, which was predominantly recognized in patients with cerebrovascular events of undetermined cause, seems to carry a risk of embolism that is comparable to cardiac and carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
