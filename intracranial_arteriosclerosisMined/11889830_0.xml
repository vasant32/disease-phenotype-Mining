<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A systematic investigation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> pathogenesis involved in large subcortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, however, has not been performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study attempted to clarify the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> mechanisms involved in large subcortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, by examining 50 patients with large subcortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> out of 430 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients consecutively registered in our department </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The subjects were divided into two groups according to the vascular territories involved on the MRI: 1) the lenticulostriate arteries group for 39 patients whose <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were restricted to within the vicinity of the lenticulostriate arteries; 2) the internal borderzone group for 11 patients whose <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> mainly involved the internal borderzone (the upper part of the <z:chebi fb="47" ids="37409">corona</z:chebi> radiata and the centrum semiovale) between the territories of the deep perforating branches from the basal cerebral arteries and the medullary branches from the superficial pial arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> pathogenesis were classified into the following 6 categories: A) cardiogenic embolism, 9 patients; B) artery-to-artery embolism, 6 patients; C) cryptogenic embolism, 2 patients; D) thrombotic <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> (M1) occlusion, 9 patients; E) thrombotic ICA occlusion, 10 patients; F) undetermined cause, 14 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The lenticulostriate arteries group consisted of 9 patients with cardiogenic embolism, 6 with artery-to-artery embolism, 2 with cryptogenic embolism, 8 with thrombotic M1 occlusion, and 14 with undetermined cause </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The internal borderzone group consisted of 10 patients with thrombotic ICA occlusion and 1 patient with thrombotic M1 occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> pathogenesis of the undetermined cause is considered to be thrombotic occlusion at the orifice of the lateral lenticulostriate artery, a so-called "branch atheromatous disease (BAD)" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The patients in this group experienced a gradual <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, and did not have a cardiac source of the embolism or proximal large artery disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among the patients reported as having SCI, BAD may play a role in some cases, especially in those whose the cause was classified as "undetermined" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the lenticulostriate arteries group exhibited a higher frequency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolisms</z:e> (cardiogenic embolism, artery-to-artery embolism, and cryptogenic embolism) and thrombotic M1 occlusion, whereas the internal borderzone group had a higher frequency of thrombotic ICA occlusion </plain></SENT>
