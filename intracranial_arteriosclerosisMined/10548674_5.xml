<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Correlation of MRI findings with atherosclerotic vascular lesions has rarely been attempted in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0236073" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebellar infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to correlate the MRI lesions with the vascular lesions seen on conventional cerebral angiography in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0236073" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebellar infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The subjects included 31 patients with cerebellar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> who underwent both MRI and conventional cerebral angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the risk factors, clinical findings, imaging study, and angiography results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We attempted to correlate MRI lesions with the vascular lesions shown in the angiograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The vascular lesions seen on angiograms were subdivided into 3 groups: large-artery disease (n=22), in situ branch artery disease (n=6), and no angiographic disease with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (n=3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The proximal segment (V1) lesions of vertebral artery were the most common angiographic features in patients with large-artery disease in which <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> most commonly involved the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) cerebellum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The V1 lesions with coexistent occlusive lesions of the intracranial vertebral and basilar arteries were correlated with cerebellar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, which had no predilection for certain cerebellar territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The intracranial occlusive disease without V1 lesion was usually correlated with small <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0742035" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebellar lesions</z:e> in PICA and superior cerebellar artery (SCA) cerebellum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The subclavian artery or brachiocephalic trunk lesion was associated with small cerebellar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The in situ branch artery disease was correlated with the PICA cerebellum lesions, which were territorial or nonterritorial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No angiographic disease with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> was associated with small-sized cerebellar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> within the SCA, anterior inferior cerebellar artery, or SCA cerebellum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates that the topographic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of cerebellar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> are correlated with diverse angiographic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The result that large-artery disease, in which nonterritorial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> are more common than territorial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, is more prevalent than in situ branch artery disease or small-artery disease, suggest that even a small cerebellar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> can be a clue to the presence of large-artery disease </plain></SENT>
