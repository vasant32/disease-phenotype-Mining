<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its level in plasma appears to influence <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, TAFI activity is strongly influenced by genetic polymorphism, especially at amino acids 147 and 325 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether these TAFI polymorphisms would act as a risk factor for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> (CI) by examining 253 samples in which the diagnosis was cliniconeuropathologically confirmed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found little that was statistically significant in terms of these polymorphisms among patients with no vascular problems or in a population-based control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the present study of an elderly Japanese group, our samples revealed a lower percentage of the Ile allele at Thr/Ile-325 compared with western counterparts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although patients with severe <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> had a lower percentage of the Ile allele (10%) at amino acid position 325 compared with the slightly and moderately affected patients and the population-based control group (15-18%), no statistical significance was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>None of our results showed any statistical correlation between TAFI polymorphisms and CI </plain></SENT>
