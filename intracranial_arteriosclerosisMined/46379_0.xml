<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In six cases an attempt was made to relieve the tension on <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> by temporarily clamping the internal carotid artery in the neck, so as to increase the expansibility of the artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This approach was based on the concept (or "A principle") that haemorrhage is caused by the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> having to bear the full force of systolic pulse pressure when <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> prevents this pressure being taken up by the normally expansile arterial wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Follow-up has been fairly short, but the preliminary findings in four of the six patients are encouraging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>More attention must be paid in the future to the significance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> from <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> and the incidence of postoperative problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The argument that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> permits the transmission of the systolic pulse directly to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> wall requires further investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The earlier pathological signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> must receive greater attention, and post-mortem study of the walls of arteries in immediate juxtaposition to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> with high-powered magnification is required </plain></SENT>
