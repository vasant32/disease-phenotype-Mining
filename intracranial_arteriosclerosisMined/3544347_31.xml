<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pure motor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> occurred in 15% and pure sensory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in 2% of the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and 30% of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were small and limited to the lenticulocapsular area, confirming that so-called lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> may be due to large vessel disease </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In MCAO the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate was 10.1% per patient-year and the ipsilateral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> rate was 7.1% per patient-year </plain></SENT>
