<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The significance of these symptoms in the correct assessment of the site of the process is demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The following variants of the pathogenesis of the extrafocal symptoms in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> disorders of the cerebral circulation were identified: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> and swelling (cranio-basal compression and stem compression in the presence of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011695'>cerebellar hemorrhage</z:hpo>); compression and dislocation (temporo-tentorial wedging and wedging of the cerebellar tonsils); secondary foci (at a distance and symmetrical); impairment of compensation in the earlier damaged structures; involvement of the functional systems (tonogenic and motor) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The pathogenesis of the extrafocal symptoms was attributed to hemorrhagic and ischemic foci, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of neurons, focal histiolysis at a distance, etc </plain></SENT>
