<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We divided 102 PCAs into four groups: control group (n = 70) with no significant stenotic lesions; PCS group (n = 7) with stenosis &gt;/= 50% of P2 segment; Col (+) group (n = 13) and Col (-) group (n = 12) had occlusive lesions in the carotid system with or without collateral flow from <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> to the middle cerebral artery through the leptomeningeal anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the PCS group, PSV (255.7 +/- 67.2 cm/s) was higher than in the other three groups (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PSV was higher in the Col (+) group (127.6 +/- 31.2) than in the Col (-) (86.6 +/- 20.1) and control (83.8 +/- 24.8) groups (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The measurement of PSV in the P2 segment of <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> using TCCS may help to identify a significant stenosis in <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
