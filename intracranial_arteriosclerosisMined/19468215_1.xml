<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The patterns on diffusion-weighted (DWI) MRI may be predictive of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this retrospective study, we assessed whether DWI bright lesions termed 'pearls' predicted the presence of large-vessel <z:hpo ids='HP_0100545'>arterial stenosis</z:hpo> as the etiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> admissions to an academic hospital over a 2-year period were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients without DWI, with hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> or with nonvascular disease were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two vascular neurologists reviewed medical records and classified the probable <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> etiology by modified TOAST (Trial of Org 10172 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Treatment) criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Another investigator, blinded to the clinical diagnoses, reviewed MRI images only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A 'pearl' was defined as a DWI bright lesion 20 mm or less in diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A 'string of pearls' was defined as 3 or more pearls in a line found unilaterally in the anterior circulation. 'Scattered pearls' were classified as 3 or more pearls distributed such that no single line could connect them, also found unilaterally in the anterior circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty-six percent of the patients with either 'pearls' sign were classified as TOAST 1 or 2, with this classification only found in 33% of the patients with other DWI patterns (p = 0.0009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>If either 'pearl' sign was seen on MRI, a patient was 2.65 times (95% CI = 1.32-5.32) more likely to have either extracranial or intracranial large-vessel stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The presence of either 'string of pearls' or 'scattered pearls' on MRI was associated with an independently determined mechanism of intracranial or extracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0100545'>arterial stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> distributions consistent with either of these patterns, additional vascular imaging should be considered </plain></SENT>
