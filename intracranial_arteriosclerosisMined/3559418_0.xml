<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The transcranial Doppler 2 MHz test, a new non-invasive investigatory method, allows direct instantaneous recording from middle cerebral artery in 96% of healthy subjects and, in contrast to classical means of measuring cerebral blood flow, the possibility of continuous monitoring of middle cerebral artery in bedridden patients or during operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This transcranial pulsed Doppler (T.P.D.) test was used to study the effect of a calcium inhibitor, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7565">Nifedipine</z:chebi>, on middle cerebral artery smooth muscle and its cerebrovascular effects in 28 subjects: 8 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, 9 of sylvian <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> confirmed by arteriography (5 approximately equal to 30% and 4 greater than or equal to 50%) and 11 healthy volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recording of middle cerebral artery flow by T.P.D. was preceded by cervicocephalic continuous emission Doppler exploration (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DMS</z:e>, MIRA 4 MHz) and vascular echotomography (Duplex Sonedap 10 MHz) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recordings from the first segment of middle cerebral artery were obtained from a low frequency (2 MHz) and high power (maximum 350 mW) probe introduced facing squamous portion of temporal bone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Identification of this artery is dependent on its depth of access--average 5 cm--its response to homolateral carotid artery compression and the convergence of its flux towards the probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After sublingual absorption of 2 to 3 capsules of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7565">Nifedipine</z:chebi>, systolic and diastolic blood pressure and systolic and diastolic frequencies of middle cerebral activity were recorded regularly over 20 minutes with the patient at rest in dorsal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011127" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">decubitus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Variations in these parameters were considered significant when 10% or more </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Criteria proposed for identification of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> were segmental acceleration of 3 kHz or more with or without associated turbulence (fig. 2).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
