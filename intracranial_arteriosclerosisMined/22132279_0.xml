<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Use of resident case logs has been considered by the Residency Review Committee for Neurology of the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This study explores the effectiveness of a data-mining program for creating resident logs and compares the results to a manual data-entry system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Other potential applications of data mining to enhancing resident education are also explored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN/METHODS: Patient notes dictated by residents were extracted from the Hospital Information System and analyzed using an unstructured mining program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>History, examination and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> codes were obtained and compared to the existing manual log </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The automated data History, examination, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e> codes were gathered for a 30-day period and compared to manual case logs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The automated method extracted <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> resident dictations with the dates of encounter and transcription </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The automated data-miner processed information from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 19 residents, while only 4 residents logged manually </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The manual method identified only broad categories of diseases; the major categories were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disorder</z:e> 53 (27.6%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> 28 (14.7%), and pain syndromes 26 (13.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the automated method, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> 114 (21.1%), cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> 114 (21.1%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> 105 (19.4%) were the most frequent primary diagnoses, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> 89 (16.5%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> 94 (17.4%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003419'>low back pain</z:hpo> 47 (9%) were the most common chief complaints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>More detailed patient information such as tobacco use 227 (42%), alcohol use 205 (38%), and drug use 38 (7%) were extracted by the data-mining method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Manual case logs are time-consuming, provide limited information, and may be unpopular with residents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Data mining is a time-effective tool that may aid in the assessment of resident experience or the ACGME core competencies or in resident clinical research </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>More study of this method in larger numbers of residency programs is needed </plain></SENT>
