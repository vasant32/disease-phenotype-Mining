<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These disorders of circulation appeared on the background [corrected] of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020538" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="HTN">hypertensive disease</z:e> or in other combination along with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> of a different etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The most significant were changes of histidase and acid phosphatase activity and an inhibition of cholinesterase activity in ischemic and hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> with expressed focal disorders of cerebral circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In an improvement of the clinical state following medicative therapy there was a normalization of these indices </plain></SENT>
