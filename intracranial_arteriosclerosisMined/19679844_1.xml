<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The feasibility of implementing an expert consensus guideline recommending use of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patient's profile to manage undiagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Following a guideline-based algorithm, we screened consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> for asymptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> using the Framingham Heart Study Coronary Risk Score (FCRS) cutoff of high risk (&gt; or = 20%) for experiencing a hard <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> event over a 10-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with high FCRS received dobutamine stress echocardiogram outpatient screening, additional treatment (beta-blocker), or further management (cardiologist referral) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From July 2004 to September 2007, among 693 patients, 501 (72%) met study criteria, of which 80 (16%) had FCRS &gt; or = 20% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Elevated serum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, nonhigh-density <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi>, glycosylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> as well as large vessel atherosclerotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> mechanism were more frequent in high versus low FCRS patients (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among high FCRS patients, 35 (44%) had dobutamine stress echocardiogram performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Leading reasons for dobutamine stress echocardiogram nonperformance were patient noncompliance (42%) and primary care physician refusal (33%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Screening for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> risk using FCRS is feasible in hospitalized patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, but outpatient adherence to stress testing is challenging largely due to patient and primary care physician-related factors </plain></SENT>
