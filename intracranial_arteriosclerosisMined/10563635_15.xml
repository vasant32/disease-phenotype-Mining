<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusive disease-induced hemodynamic disturbance is associated with extensive white matter high-intensity lesions (WMLs) on T2-weighted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images in the hemisphere with lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in the basal ganglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Hemodynamic disturbance in the brain with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878486" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arteriolosclerosis</z:e> may be one of the mechanisms by which ischemic injury induces extensive WMLs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors used MRI and PET to study 21 patients with unilateral ICA occlusion or stenosis and lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in the bilateral basal ganglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In hemispheres with ICA disease, the association of WMLs with the mean hemispheric values of oxygen extraction fraction (OEF)-an index of hemodynamic compromise-measured with the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="36932">15O</z:chebi>-labeled gas steady-state technique was analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five patients with ICA occlusive disease without lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> were studied as control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the hemispheres with ICA disease, patients with lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> had a significantly greater severity of WMLs than control subjects, although the mean hemispheric values of the OEF showed no significant difference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The severity of WMLs correlated significantly with the mean hemispheric values of the OEF in patients with lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, but not in control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis revealed that lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and increased OEF were independent predictors of extensive WMLs, with lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> the most heavily weighted factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Internal carotid artery occlusive disease-induced hemodynamic disturbance is associated with extensive WMLs in hemispheres with lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Hemodynamic disturbance may contribute to the development of extensive WMLs, although brain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878486" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arteriolosclerosis</z:e> may be a major contributing factor </plain></SENT>
