<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>953 patients less than or equal to 69 yrs with documented coronary, cerebral or peripheral atherosclerotic disease were studied and followed-up for 24 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Examinations included hemostatic and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> laboratory assays, arterial Doppler examination, cerebral computerized tomography and nuclear magnetic resonance, exercise electrocardiogram and coronary angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fibrinogen (301.4 +/- 71.52 mg/dl) correlated positively with antithrombin III (r = 0.27) and leukocytes (r = 0.25), negatively with <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> (r = 0.18) and tended to increase with smoking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Heavy smokers had higher leukocyte counts than non-smokers (8.0 +/- 2.0 vs. 7.2 +/- 2.1 x 10(3)/microliters), higher <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> (1.87 +/- 1.12 vs. 1.53 +/- 1.35 mmol/l) and lower <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> (0.93 +/- 0.27 vs. 1.00 +/- 0.25 mmol/l) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>FVII correlated positively with <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> (r = 0.16) and protein C (r = 0.45) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>vWF:Ag (145.4 +/- 70.58%) ad FVII:C (139.7 +/- 59.10%) were positively correlated (r = 0.44) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>FVIII:C correlated positively with fibrinogen (r = 0.21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>Myocardial infarction</z:hpo> survivors with associated cerebral and peripheral vascular lesions had higher FVIII:C, FVII, fibronogen and vWF:Ag </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that hemostatic factors may enhance and/or mediate the effects of conventional risk factors in atherothrombotic ischemic events </plain></SENT>
