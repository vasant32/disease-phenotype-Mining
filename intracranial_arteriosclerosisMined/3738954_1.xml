<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The exact role of these <z:hpo ids='HP_0003651'>foam cells</z:hpo> in the pathogenesis of <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> remains uncertain, but one potential function is to take-up and process excess interstitial arterial <z:chebi fb="2" ids="6495">lipoproteins</z:chebi>, suggested by their extraordinary ability to engulf enormous quantities of modified <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low density lipoproteins</z:chebi> by the so-called "scavenging pathway." To test this possibility, monocytes from 15 atherothrombotic brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> patients and age and sex matched controls were isolated and cultured for 7-8 days in 20% <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The monocyte-derived macrophages were investigated for their ability to bind, internalize and degrade both native and modified (acetylated) <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> labelled with 125Iodine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>While native <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> was metabolized similarly, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> macrophages displayed significantly reduced ability to scavenge modified <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that insufficient processing of interstitial arterial cholesterol by monocyte-derived macrophages may contribute to the aggravation of atheroma formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This inadequacy is likely further compromised by reduced levels of serum <z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">high density lipoprotein</z:chebi> since the absence of a cholesterol-acceptor will promote the slow but continued accumulation of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> and the formation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003651'>foam cells</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
