<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During TICC, the patients showed a marked activation of the blood kinin system which was especially pronounced in hypertonic rises </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The underlying disease had a significant impact on the time-course of kinin system activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In patients with TICC associated with hypertonic crises, hypotensive treatment decreased kinin activity to a considerable degree whereas in cases of cerebral vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> the treatment exerted no noticeable effect on the activity of kinins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The involvement of kinins in the processes of the compensation and pathogenesis in TICC is discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is recommended that TICC associated with arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> be treated by <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30762">salicylate</z:chebi>, whereas in TICC associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> the administration of antikinin drugs is indicated (parmidin, prodectin) </plain></SENT>
