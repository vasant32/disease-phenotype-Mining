<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The clinical angiographic and prognostic features of 13 patients with symptomatic stenosis of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) admitted between 1970 and 1981 have been reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The etiology of the stenosis was probably <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, except in 1 case due to fibro-muscular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, 1 with post-radiation <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">angiopathy</z:e> and 2 related to oral contraceptives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two main clinical groups were delineated: 1) transitory and minor ischemic accidents always arising in the same arterial area; these occurred in older patients with multiples atheromatous lesions along the carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>2) progressive--or stepwise--<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> occurring in younger patients, mainly females, with isolated <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These cerebrovascular symptoms and signs, in the absence of carotid bruit, Doppler ultrasonography abnormality or evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442840" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac embolism</z:e> should suggest intracranial stenosis and require appropriate therapy to avoid complete occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our study shows that early medical treatment--anti-coagulation, then antiaggregation--provides a suitable alternative to EC/IC bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This is suggested by evidence for micro-embolization in addition to hemodynamic mechanisms </plain></SENT>
