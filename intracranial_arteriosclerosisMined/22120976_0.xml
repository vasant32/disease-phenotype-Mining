<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>IC catheter-based therapy (CBT) using balloon angioplasty with or without stent placement is an option for patients who have failed medical therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We sought to examine the outcomes of CBT for patients with symptomatic IC <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arterial disease</z:e> managed by experienced interventional cardiologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively studied 89 consecutive symptomatic patients with 99 significant (≥70% diameter) IC arterial stenoses who underwent CBT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CBT was performed by experienced interventional cardiologists with the consultative support of a neurovascular team </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Procedure success was achieved in 96/99 (97%) lesions and percent diameter stenosis was reduced from 91% ± 7.5% preprocedure to 19% ± 15% postprocedure (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The rate of in-hospital periprocedural <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was 3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate at 1 year was 5.7% (5/88) and at 2 years was 13.5% (11/81) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The 2-year <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality was 11.3% (10/88) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: For patients with symptomatic IC <z:hpo ids='HP_0100545'>arterial stenosis</z:hpo> who have failed medical therapy or are considered very high risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, CBT performed by experienced interventional cardiologists is safe and offers both high procedural success rates and excellent clinical outcomes at 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CBT is an attractive option for this high-risk patient population considering the expected 12-15% rate of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> at 1 year </plain></SENT>
