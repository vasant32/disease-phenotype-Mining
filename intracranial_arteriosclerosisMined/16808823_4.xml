<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Endovascular treatment for intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> is evolving, but complications remain an issue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most interventions are performed under general anesthesia, preventing intraprocedural clinical evaluations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We describe our approach to intracranial angioplasty and stenting, using local rather than general anesthesia, and intraprocedural neurological assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We prospectively collected procedural and outcome information on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients undergoing intracranial angioplasty and stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients underwent interventions under local anesthesia with mild intravenous sedation or <z:mp ids='MP_0004270'>analgesia</z:mp> only if needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intraoperative neurological evaluations were performed, and symptomatology was used to guide the interventional technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-eight arteries in 40 patients with a mean age of 65.2 years were treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirty-two anterior and 16 posterior circulation segments were treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Technical success was achieved in 100% of patients with reduction of the mean pretreatment stenosis from 85 +/- 8.6% to 7 +/- 10.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Stents were deployed in 40 segments; five patients were treated with drug-eluting stents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="240" ids="27638">cobalt</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="74" ids="28073">chromium</z:chebi> coronary stents were the easiest to deliver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thirty-seven patients were treated under local anesthesia and, of those, 61.4% experienced intraprocedural symptoms that led to some alteration of the interventional technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>Headache</z:hpo> was the most common symptom, and, when persistent, it heralded the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There were seven total neurological complications, but only five (10.5%) led to permanent morbidity (4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>) or mortality (1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Intracranial angioplasty and stenting can be successfully performed using coronary techniques and equipment including drug-eluting stents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Local anesthesia permits neurological evaluations and often leads to the adjustment of the interventional technique, potentially making the procedure safer </plain></SENT>
