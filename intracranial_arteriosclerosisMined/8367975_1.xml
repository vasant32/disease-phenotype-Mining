<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Study participants were randomly selected from the official register of the city of Graz </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The rate of positive response was 26.9 percent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects underwent an extensive risk factor screening with Duplex scanning of the carotid arteries obtained from a subset of 176 individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of well-documented cerebrovascular risk factors was 40.6% for arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, 35.4% for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e>, 8.5% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> und 3% for elevated haematocrit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The less well-documented cerebrovascular risk factors <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e>, overweight, physical inactivity, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011899'>hyperfibrinogenemia</z:hpo> and smoking were noted in 75%, 33.7%, 27.2%, 14.9% and 12.2% of subjects, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multiple well-documented risk factors were noted in 23.7% of the examined volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multiple linear regression analysis revealed body mass index (p &lt; 0.0001) and age (p &lt; 0.0001) as independent predictors of the frequency of well-documented risk factors observed in any individual </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Atherosclerotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0741975" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid disease</z:e> occurred in 61.9% of study participants investigated by Doppler sonography and was significantly associated with age (p &lt; 0.00001), life-time tobacco consumption (p &lt; 0.0001) and the concentration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> B (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Implications for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> prevention result from the conjunction of overweight and frequency of risk factors noted in any study participant, as well as from the relationship of carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> to smoking and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
