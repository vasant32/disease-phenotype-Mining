<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate the incidence of vascular lesions in the head and neck by magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), and investigate the factors correlated with severe stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Elective coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) was performed in 413 patients at our center between May 1997 and April 2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used MRA to detect head and neck vascular lesions, then evaluated the occlusive lesions and determined their prevalence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Neck MRA was performed in 335 patients and head MRA was performed in 335 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found &gt; or = 60% stenosis or total occlusion of the extracranial carotid and vertebral artery in 43 patients (12.8%) and &gt; or = 60% stenosis or occlusion of the intracranial carotid and basilar artery, or stenosis accompanied by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0235530" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">poor peripheral perfusion</z:e> or occlusion of the cerebral arteries in 45 patients (13.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Occlusive lesions of the neck were significantly correlated with mean age, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>peripheral vascular disease</z:hpo> (PVD), and old <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Occlusive lesions of the brain were significantly correlated with age, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, PVD, and left main trunk disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We found an equal incidence of intracranial and extracranial vascular lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, searching for intracranial lesions is just as important as searching for extracranial lesions before CABG </plain></SENT>
