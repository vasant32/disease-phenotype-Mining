<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Enrolled in the study were 11 patients (8 men and 3 women, mean age 54.2 +/- 6.2 years) who had undergone endovascular stent placement for <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using SPM and SPAM analyses, we compared the number of significant voxels and cerebral counts in basal and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> SPECT images before and after stenting, and assessed the perfusion changes and cerebral vascular reserve index (CVRI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The numbers of hypoperfusion voxels in SPECT images were decreased from 10,083 +/- 8,326 to 4,531 +/- 5,091 in basal images (P = 0.0317) and from 13,398 +/- 14,222 to 7,699 +/- 10,199 in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> images (P = 0.0142) after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On SPAM analysis, the increases in cerebral counts were significant in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> images (90.9 +/- 2.2 to 93.5 +/- 2.3, P = 0.0098) but not in basal images (91 +/- 2.7 to 92 +/- 2.6, P = 0.1602) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The CVRI also showed a statistically significant increase from before stenting (median 0.32; 95% CI -2.19-2.37) to after stenting (median 1.59; 95% CI -0.85-4.16; P = 0.0068) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study revealed the usefulness of voxel-based analysis of basal/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> brain perfusion SPECT after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stent placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study showed that SPM and SPAM analyses of basal/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> Tc-99m brain SPECT could be used to evaluate the short-term hemodynamic efficacy of successful <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stent placement </plain></SENT>
