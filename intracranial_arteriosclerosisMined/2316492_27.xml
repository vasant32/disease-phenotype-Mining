<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The search for explanatory variables revealed three with the characteristics of having both opposing patterns of associations with clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> compared with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> and of being more prevalent in Japan than in Hawaii </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These variables were low serum cholesterol levels, high intake of alcohol, and some aspect of an Oriental diet characterized by low intake of fat and protein from animal sources </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Analysis of associations of these variables with measures of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in coronary and cerebral arteries revealed no paradoxical differences, with the possible exception of some dietary variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Associations with autopsy-measured <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarctions</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, however, showed opposing patterns similar to those found for clinical disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The main inference from this work is that the paradoxically high risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> observed in populations with low risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> is not due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in the major cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Rather, it is more likely due to lesions in the small intracerebral arteries and appears to be related to low levels of serum cholesterol, high alcohol intake, and some aspect of a traditional Oriental diet </plain></SENT>
