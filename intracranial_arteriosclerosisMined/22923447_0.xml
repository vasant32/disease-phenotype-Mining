<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although the ability of MRI to investigate carotid plaque composition is well established, the mechanism and the significance of plaque <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi> (Gd) enhancement remain unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated clinical and histological significance of Gd enhancement of carotid plaque in patients undergoing endarterectomy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty-nine patients scheduled for a carotid endarterectomy prospectively underwent a 3-T MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Carotid plaque enhancement was assessed on T1-weighted images performed before and 5 minutes after Gd injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Enhancement was recorded according to its localization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Histological analysis was performed of the entire plaque and of the area with matched contrast enhancement on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Gd enhancement was observed in 59% patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three types of carotid plaques were identified depending on enhancement location (shoulder region, shoulder and fibrous cap, and central in the plaque) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fibrous cap rupture, intraplaque <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, and plaque Gd enhancement was significantly more frequent in symptomatic than in asymptomatic patients (P=0.043, P&lt;0.0001, and P=0.034, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After histological analysis, Gd enhancement was significantly associated with vulnerable plaque (American Heart Association VI, P=0.006), neovascularization (P&lt;0.0001), macrophages (P=0.030), and loose <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> (P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Prevalence of neovessels, macrophages, and loose <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> in the area of Gd enhancement was 97%, 87%, and 80%, respectively, and was different depending on the enhancement location in the plaque </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Fibrous cap status and composition were different depending on the type of plaque </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Gd enhancement of carotid plaque is associated with vulnerable plaque phenotypes and related to an inflammatory process </plain></SENT>
