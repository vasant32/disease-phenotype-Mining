<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a multivariate statistical model, among the following variables: sex, age, systolic BP, diastolic BP, cholesterol and smoking, systolic BP was found the best predictor of extent and severity of <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> at extracranial level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>None of the same variables was predictive of the severity of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results of this clinical study may confirm the indication, coming from physiopathologic observations, of a predominant role of systolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in the process of maintenance and acceleration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in the large pre-cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
