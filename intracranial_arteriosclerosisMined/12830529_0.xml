<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Immunoreactions with antigens to cerebral vessels affected by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in 330 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> aged 46-82 years with different stages of the disease and various location of CA process was studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The presence of autoimmune humoral reactions (complement binding reaction, leukocyte lysis reaction, modified erythrocyte sedimentation rate) and cellular reaction (antigene-reactive rosette formation) with antigenes to cerebral vessels affected by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, which intensity significantly prevailed in patients as compared with control groups (healthy young people and people whose age was close to that of patients without symptoms of cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Statistically significant prevalence of reactions with antigenes to cerebral vessels affected by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> intensity above reactions with extracts of intact brain vessels was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intensity of those reactions with antigenes to cerebral vessels affected by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> was increased with evolution of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> and depended on the location of atherosclerotic process: reactions were more pronounced in those arterial territories where the atherosclerotic lesion predominated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>High correlation rates of autoimmune reactions with antigenes to cerebral vessels affected by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> intensity and some parameters of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> metabolism (total cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">low density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>), revealed a relationship between the reactions given and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo>, which confirms the relationship of cerebral vessels antigenicity to the degree of atherosclerotic lesion </plain></SENT>
