<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied medical conditions of drivers and passengers in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> motor vehicle crashes with fatalities in Finland in 2001 and 2002 by using reports of road accident investigation teams, including autopsy reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analyzed a total of 542 crashes with 640 fatalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Findings were also compared with available epidemiological data in Finland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: An insignificant difference in the number of reported diseases was present between the different parties involved in crashes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, among killed key drivers, so-called A-parties, psychiatric diseases, especially <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001973" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">alcoholism</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, and unspecific <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004936" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">mental disorders</z:e>, were diagnosed more often than in the groups of other drivers or passengers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, A-parties were reported to more frequently suffer from cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> and arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Drivers' diseases can be a risk factor for traffic accidents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fitness to drive should therefore be considered in medical practice, particularly in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001973" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">alcoholism</z:e> and other <z:hpo ids='HP_0000708'>psychiatric disorders</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
