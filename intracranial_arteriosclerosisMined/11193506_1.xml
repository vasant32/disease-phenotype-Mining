<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present work we produced and investigated <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> in cerebral arteries of WHHL rabbits by inducing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> was induced by right nephrectomy and surgically induced stenosis of the left renal artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Six months after surgery the rabbits were killed for morphologic, immunohistochemical and transmission electron microscopic studies of extracranial and cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A significant rise in systolic blood pressure was evident 3 months after surgery in the hypertensive group (p &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>Atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> had developed areas near the vertebral-basilar arterial confluence and the circle of Willis in the hypertensive Watanabe rabbits by 6 months after surgery (p &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>Atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> in cerebral arteries remained less severe than in the aorta and coronary arteries, and showed qualitative morphologic differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This is the first report of production by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> of experimental cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in the WHHL rabbits, indicating that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> as well as <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo> was required for development of lesions in cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This model should be useful for studying development of cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and may contribute to improved prevention and treatment of the human disease </plain></SENT>
