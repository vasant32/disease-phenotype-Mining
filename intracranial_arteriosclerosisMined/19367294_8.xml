<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Most clinical trials have focused on the presence of perfusion- and diffusion-weighted imaging (PWI-DWI) mismatch by more than 20%, and different <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes were lumped together </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that intracranial large artery atherosclerotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (IC-LAA) would show different PWI-DWI and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA)-DWI mismatch profiles, compared with other <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Consecutive patients underwent pretreatment multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> middle cerebral artery <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> within 6 h of symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We assessed the difference in the DWI-PWI mismatch ratio, severity of hypoperfusion, and MRA-DWI mismatch among the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of 86 patients, 19 (22.1%) had IC-LAA; 42 (48.8%) cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, 15 (17.4%) extracranial-LAA, and 10 (11.6%) had cryptogenic embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although the volume of the penumbra was not different among the groups, the mismatch ratio was higher (P=0.003) and the severity of hypoperfusion was lower in the IC-LAA group (P=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The MRA-DWI mismatch was more prevalent in the IC-LAA group than in other groups (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Collateral grading, assessed in 41 patients, was more likely to be intermediate/excellent in the IC-LAA group (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariate testing revealed that a larger mismatch ratio and less severe hypoperfusion, and MRA-DWI mismatch were independently associated with IC-LAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our data show that patients with IC-LAA had different mismatch profiles, which were related to better collaterals, compared with other subtypes </plain></SENT>
