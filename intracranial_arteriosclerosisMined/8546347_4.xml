<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The authors investigated the relation between <z:hpo ids='HP_0004929'>coronary atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, angiographically detected, and intimal-medial (I-M) thickening of the common carotid artery (CCA), as measured by high-resolution B-mode ultrasound system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They studied 31 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (CAD) and 23 healthy control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>I-M thickening of CCAs and atheromatous plaques at the carotid bifurcation were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A score system was defined (range 0-20) based on the absence or presence of <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> at common and internal carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A coronary angiography score was defined based on the presence of of <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> at nine coronary arterial segments (range 0-36) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The thickness of CCAs (M +/- SD) in CAD patients was significantly higher (1.45 +/- 0.95 mm) than in controls (0.87 +/- 0.10 mm, P &lt; 0.005), and an I-M thickening of 1.1 mm or more was specific and positively predictive of CAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A significant positive correlation between coronary and carotid score was observed (P &lt; 0.028, r = 0.373) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The study suggests that I-M thickening could be helpful for the identification of patients at risk for CAD </plain></SENT>
