<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 52% of the patients <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> of brain vessels was associated with arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (group I), in 48 per cent venous discirculatory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> was diagnosable against the background of arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (group IIA-20%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>arterial hypotension</z:hpo> (group IIB-26%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both tanakan and vincamin were found to be effective in group I patients; however, in stage III condition their effectiveness was no better than 42 and 15% respectively, which fact might be due to organic changes in the vascular wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Tanakan appeared to be more beneficial in group II patients since venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001332'>dystonia</z:hpo> is considered to be the main pathogenetic link in this context, and tanakan is known to improve the venous outflow from the cranial cavity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Almost in one-third of group IIB patients vincamin worsened general health status, especially so in stage III discirculatory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo>, which fact may be related to peculiar effect of the drug on the arterial link of brain blood supply </plain></SENT>
