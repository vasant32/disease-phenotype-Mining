<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate a novel multislice CT system (16-slice-spiral-CT scanner) for the diagnosis of carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Five patients with symptomatic atherosclerotic disease of the carotid arteries were examined with a 16- slice-spiral-CT scanner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Collimation was 16 x 0.75 mm, table speed 36 mm/s (pitch of 1.5), rotation time 0.5 s, tube current was 160 eff.<z:chebi fb="6" ids="25427">mAs</z:chebi> at 120 kV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>60 ml of contrast material were injected with a power injector followed by a saline flush </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The start delay was measured with test bolus method (20 ml CM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interactive multiplanar reformation (iMPR) and thin slab MIP as well as volume rendering were used for image evaluation and presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Scan time was 9 s for a range of 300 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This allowed imaging the whole length of the carotid artery (aortic arch to circle of Willis) in a true arterial phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Pulsation artefacts did not impair the evaluation of the vessels at the level of the aortic arch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overall image quality of both "source images" and 3D-reconstructions was excellent, due to a reduced voxel size of 0.03 mm (3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Image evaluation and postprocessing (iMPR, MIP) was done within 15 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>iMPR was highly accurate for demonstrating plaque <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and determining the percentage of the stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: For the first time, true arterial phase images of the entire carotid artery with high spatial resolution could be acquired using a 16-slice-spiral-CT scanner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This method offers the potential to replace catheter angiography in the evaluation of carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
