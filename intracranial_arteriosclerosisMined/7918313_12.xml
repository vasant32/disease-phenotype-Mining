<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the relation between sonographically assessed carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and body iron stores in a population sample of 847 men and women aged 40 to 79 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a logistic regression analysis adjusting for age, sex, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> major vascular risk markers, ferritin emerged as one of the strongest indicators of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery disease</z:e> in both sexes (40 to 59 years; odds ratio, 1.54 per 100 micrograms/L; P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The predictive significance of ferritin was found to be synergistic with that of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the elderly (&gt; or = 60 years) the predictive significance of ferritin was found to decrease parallel to that of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> B </plain></SENT>
