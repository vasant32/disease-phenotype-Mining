<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We therefore investigated the association between glycemic variability and cervical and/or intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in Chinese type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study in 216 type 2 diabetic patients with a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c of 8.3 +/- 1.7% and a median <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> duration of 9.0 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The standard deviation of blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> values (SDBG) and the mean amplitude of glycemic excursion (MAGE) were calculated from continuous <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> monitoring system data for assessing glycemic variability while 24h mean blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (MBG) was calculated for measuring overall blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) was used to detect cervical and/or intracranial plaque, and ultrasonography was used to quantify carotid intima-media thickness (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>) as an index of subclinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred and fifty-three patients (70.8%) presented with cervical and/or intracranial lesions on MRA among 216 patients in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Elder age, increased systolic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020538" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="HTN">blood pressure, increased</z:e> MBG and elevated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">low density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> were independent contributors to plaque formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In patients without stenosis (n = 63), SDBG (r = 0.412, P = 0.001) and MAGE (r = 0.365, P = 0.005) were both correlated with carotid <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> and these relationships remained significant in multiple linear regression analysis (multiple R2 = 0.314 for the model including SDBG and multiple R2 = 0.268 for the model including MAGE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, SDBG and MAGE were not significantly different among patients with different stenosis degrees </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Glycemic variability is associated with subclinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in Chinese type 2 diabetic patients </plain></SENT>
