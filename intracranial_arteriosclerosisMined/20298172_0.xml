<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We included 120 healthy volunteers (conventional risk factors for cerebrovascular disease were excluded) who were examined at our Neurology Department </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They were divided into 6 age groups-(25-35, 36-45, 46-55, 56-65, 66-75, 76+ years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We performed standard laboratory workup, body weight and height measurements, Color Doppler and Power Doppler of the main head and neck vessels and Transcranial Doppler, (measured by means of e-Tracking software) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was decline of BHI, and increase in AS - in correlation with age increase (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was statistically significant negative correlation between BHI and AS (r= -0,931, p&lt;0.01 right and r = -0,938, p&lt;0.01 left) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results show that decline in BHI as parameter for intracranial microvessel dysfunction is in good correlation with increase of AS as functional parameter of extracranial vascular aging </plain></SENT>
