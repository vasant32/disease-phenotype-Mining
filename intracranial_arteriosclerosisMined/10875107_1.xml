<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To clarify clinical characteristics of atypical idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002343'>normal pressure hydrocephalus</z:hpo> (AINPH) and indications for shunt operations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Subjects examined in the present study included 65 patients who satisfied the following 4 diagnostic criteria of AINPH and underwent V.P shunt with Medos type shunt system; set pressure: epidural standard pressure x 13.6 - 20 mmH2O (omission of a figure in the first place) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The diagnostic criteria were: 1) no apparent history of intra- or extra-cranial disease; 2) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> was present as a main complaint; 3) the presence of moderate to severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002059'>cerebral atrophy</z:hpo> and ventricular enlargement and PVL around the anterior horn on CT scans; 4) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cerebrospinal pressure and filling of ventricles or subarachnoid space with contrast medium at 24 hours on cisternography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients were aged 49-83 with the mean age of 62.9 years; the ratio of male to female was 37:28 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They were categorized as shunt-effective (group E: 36 cases) or non-shunt-effective (group NE: 29 cases), and the following parameters in both groups were compared: 1. clinical characteristics: 2. the presence or absence of pressure wave (PW) during preoperative continuous epidural pressure measurement (EDPM) 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CSF outflow resistance (Ro) 4. preoperative serum alpha-1-antichymotrpsin (alpha-1-ACT) 5. cerebral arteriovenous difference of oxygen content (c-AVDO2) before and after surgery 6. mean cerebral blood flow (mCBF; 99mTc-HMPAO-SPECT) before and after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Group E had a shorter duration between symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and hospital visit (within 16 months and showed hyporoluntary and hyporeactivity as their main complaints associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001288'>gait disturbance</z:hpo>; the time course of symptoms was classified as suddenly progressing and fluctuating in many cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Group NE had a relatively longer duration between symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and hospital visit and showed activeness, wandering, nervousness and quick temper as their main complaints; the time course of symptoms was classified as progressing in many cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>PW-positive cases were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> included in group E. but some PW-negative cases were also observed in group E </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Ro was significantly higher in group E (p &lt; 0.01), and cases with a Ro value over 20 mmHg/ml/min. were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> included in group E </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>alpha-1-ACT was significantly lower in group E (p &lt; 0.05), and cases with an alpha-1-ACT value over 55 mg/dl were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> included in group NE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Although preoperative c-AVDO2 was significantly higher in group E (p &lt; 0.05), cases with a c-AVDO2 value over 8.5 ml% were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> included in group NE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>c-AVDO2 values were within 5-8.5 ml% in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of group E </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>mCBF significantly increased after surgery in group E (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>It was confirmed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002059'>cerebral atrophy</z:hpo> in group E on AINPH is caused by a cerebral circulation disturbance defined as a cerebral blood flow of penumbra or more due to cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo>, etc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>A flowchart of indications for shunt surgery for AINPH was prepared based on the results of the present study </plain></SENT>
