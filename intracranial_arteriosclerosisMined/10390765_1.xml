<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: The risk of having a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accident</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="46274">CVA</z:chebi>) is approximately 3 to 5 times greater in the diabetic population than in non-diabetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The physiopathological mechanisms of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46274">CVAs</z:chebi> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> are not well-known, since few studies of this have been done </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To verify the hypothesis that intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo>, interpreted from findings of stenosis on intracranial Doppler studies, is greater in diabetics than in non-diabetics, independently of other vascular risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were selected from the Register of Cerebrovascular Diseases of the Neurology Department of the Hospital de Santa Maria as having had an ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accident</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="46274">CVA</z:chebi>)/transient ischemic accident (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>), assessed by a colour codified vertebral carotid eco-Doppler and transcranial Doppler </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intracranial changes in the diabetic and non-diabetic groups of patients were compared with relation to the presence of risks such as hypercolestrolaemia, arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and smoking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 384 patients were included, 71 were diabetic and 313 non-diabetic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The two groups were comparable with regard to average age and sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Intracranial stenosis was approximately 3.13 (95% CI = 1.69-5.79) times more frequent in the diabetic population than in non-diabetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This difference persisted independently of the presence or absence of other vascular risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>Diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> is an important independent risk factor of alterations in the intracranial blood vessels and therefore of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46274">CVA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The intracranial circulation should be studied in these patients in view of the great frequency of intracranial stenoses and possible future improvements with therapeutic intervention </plain></SENT>
