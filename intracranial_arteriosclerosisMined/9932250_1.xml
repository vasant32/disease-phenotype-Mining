<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: We studied the influence of age on the utility of carotid sonography in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The results of Doppler ultrasound examinations of the carotid arteries in 613 consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> (n = 450) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> (n = 163) were analyzed for different age groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For each patient, the grade of stenosis was scored for the ipsilateral internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results of the ultrasound examinations were correlated with angiographic findings and findings at endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The extent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> for each age group was expressed as the ratio between the number of grade II-IV stenoses (&gt; or = 50%) in the carotid arteries and the number of patients in that group ("<z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> ratio") </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Under the age of 40 years, high-grade atherosclerotic stenoses were not found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, 3 relatively young patients had dissections of the internal carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> ratio exceeded 0.5 for age groups 65-69 years through 80+ years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among the patients with high-grade stenoses, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e> prevented endarterectomy in 63% of patients in age group 80+ years, 44% in age group 75-79 years, and 26% in age group 70-74 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Carotid sonography did not detect any significant atherosclerotic changes in young patients but was useful for diagnosing other etiologies of ischemic cerebral disease, eg, carotid dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At the other end of the spectrum, the impact of carotid sonography on patient management appears to be limited in patients over the age of 70 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Carotid sonography seems to be most useful for patients 40-69 years old </plain></SENT>
