<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>24 (= 12.8%) patients had a significantly reduced perfusion of the common or internal carotid artery, proximal subclavian artery with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751531" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">subclavian steal</z:e>, or vertebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>2 patients showed a simultaneous involvement of two neck arteries, 3 patients of three neck arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The incidence of significant flow impairment of the neck arteries rose with increasing coronary artery involvement: 5.4% in 1-vessel CAD, 12.3% in 2-vessel CAD, 16.3% in 3-vessel CAD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Due to a considerable number of false negative and false positive findings, auscultation proved to be unreliable in the detection of hemodynamically relevant flow disturbances of the extracranial cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that at least <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> candidates for aortocoronary bypass surgery should undergo ultrasound Doppler sonography of the neck arteries </plain></SENT>
