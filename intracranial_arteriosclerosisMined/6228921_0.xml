<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our own study of a series of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tia|TIA|T.I.A.">transient ischaemic attacks</z:e> revealed that even when due allowance was made for interaction between haematocrit, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and smoking, there was still evidence that both male and female patients had a higher haematocrit than age and sex matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Toghi's autopsy study further shows that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> is more frequently found in the elderly population in subjects with a high haematocrit, the effect being most obvious in the presence of severe cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow is inversely related to haematocrit, reflecting the physiological maintenance of oxygen supply according to the metabolic demands of cerebral tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When oxygen carriage is enhanced at high haematocrit, flow <z:hpo ids='HP_0002527'>falls</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This could however, predispose in the face of atheroma to <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, a suggestion given some support by the finding that amongst <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> patients the greatest proportion with a haematocrit over 50 were found among those with thrombotic carotid occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The effect of haematocrit on flow might become limiting when considering collateral flow, and flow in a maximally dilated vascular bed in the territory of recent infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This hypothesis is supported by the finding that the size of the cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> accompanying carotid occlusion is greater in patients with an elevated haematocrit.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
