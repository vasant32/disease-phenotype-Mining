<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of these, 22 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0010980'>hyperlipoproteinemia</z:hpo> (HLIPR) by paper electrophoresis and by elevation of principal plasma <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> (either cholesterol over 300 mg/100 ml or <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> over 200 mg/100 ml or both these components) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>More than two-thirds of the patients had at least one close relative with elevated blood <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using criteria of the World Health Organization, these patients were classified as follows: 5 had HLIPR type IIa, 8 had HLIPR type IIb, 3 had HLIPR type III and 6 had HLIPR type IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">Phospholipids</z:chebi> showed relatively little change from the values of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The numerical distribution of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and HLIPR into the four different types corresponds quite well with the approximate frequency of these types of HLIPR in the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, this study does not indicate that the patients with a particular type of HLIPR are at a greater risk to have a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> than those belonging to other types </plain></SENT>
