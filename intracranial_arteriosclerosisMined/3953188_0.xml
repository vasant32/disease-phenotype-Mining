<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Occlusion of the internal carotid artery was associated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> of various size in the cortex and the subcortical substance of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When there was a good collateral blood flow along the anastomoses of the cerebral surface from the posterior cerebral artery into the system of occluded internal carotid artery, these were small <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in the white substance of the frontal lobes which were not lacunar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The major importance in the development of cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> in cases of occluded internal carotid artery belongs to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Small deep (lacunar) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> develop in cases of complete patency of the carotid arteries and the leading role in their genesis belongs to changes in the intracerebral arteries characteristic of arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> rather than to atherosclerotic lesion of the major arteries of the head </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, localization of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarctions</z:e> in arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> combined with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> is determined by the state of the carotid arteries and characteristics of the collateral circulation while any of the diseases may play the leading role in their development </plain></SENT>
