<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between March 2007 and October 2007, a total of 25 patients (20 male, age median 67 years) with 30 IAAS underwent endovascular treatment using Coroflex Blue stents (B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Braun, Germany) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Location and degree of target stenoses before and after treatment and at follow-up and adverse clinical sequelae of treatment were registered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Angiographic follow-up was scheduled for 6, 12, 26, and 52 weeks after the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 30 treated lesions were located as follows: nine in intracranial-extradural internal carotid artery (ICA), three in intradural ICA, five in middle cerebral artery, eight in intradural vertebral artery, and five in basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The technical success rate was 100% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The degree of stenoses prior to and after treatment was 61 +/- 2% and 26 +/- 3% (mean +/- SE), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A residual stenosis of &lt;50% was achieved in 29 (97%) procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Treatment was uneventful in 28 out of 30 procedures (93%); one patient suffered a transient and one patient a permanent neurological deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Angiographic follow-up was available in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the patients (100%) after 15.2 months (median) and showed significant (i.e., more than 50%) degree of recurrent stenosis in 11 (37%) of the lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Retreatment was performed in 11 (37%) lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The Coroflex Blue stent is easily inserted and safely deployed into intracranial arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The incidence of recurrent stenoses remains a concern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Stringent angiographic and clinical follow-up and retreatment are therefore mandatory </plain></SENT>
