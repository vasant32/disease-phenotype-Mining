<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Deposition of fibrinogen and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> was most frequent at the bifurcation of the middle cerebral arteries and least in the basilar arteries in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> age groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In general, deposition of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> was associated with deposition of fibrinogen, and lone deposition of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> in the absence of fibrinogen was only rarely seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fibrinogen was scattered in the intercellular spaces, and located in the inner layer or edges of the thickened intima of the bifurcation with increasing plaque formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fibrinogen was observed even in the subendothelial region of the uninvolved intima at the bifurcations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> was present in the cytoplasm of the endothelial cells in the earliest stage, and it increased in the extracellular stroma with increase in intimal thickening, corresponding closely to the distribution of perifibous oil-red-O-stained <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> was detected in the uninvolved intima </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The observations suggest that deposition of fibrinogen in the intima might precede <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> deposition and possibly play a more important role than <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> in the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> in the cerebral arteries, especially in their early stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> at the bifurcations may be in part due to increased permeation of these plasma proteins, possibly as a result of hemodynamic stress </plain></SENT>
