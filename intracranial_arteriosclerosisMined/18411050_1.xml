<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Blood samples were taken from 171 cerebral infarction inpatients to determine the levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, serum total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi>, serum plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> a </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subjects were also screened for MS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Atherothrombotic infarction was most prevalent, followed by lacunar and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264978" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">embolic infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
