<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to assess the safety and performance of the Wingspan stent system and Gateway percutaneous transluminal angioplasty balloon catheter in the treatment of high-grade, intracranial <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> in patients who had failed medical therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this prospective, multicenter, single-arm study, medically refractory patients with a modified Rankin score &lt; or =3 and recurrent symptoms attributable to angiographically demonstrated intracranial stenosis &gt; or =50% in a vessel 2.5 to 4.5 mm in diameter were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Intracranial lesions were predilated with an undersized Gateway balloon catheter to 80% of the native vessel diameter, followed by deployment of the self-expanding Wingspan stent to facilitate further remodeling of the atherosclerotic plaque and to maintain vessel patency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neurologic examinations and angiograms were performed at 6 months after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the 45 patients enrolled, the degree of stenosis was reduced from a baseline of 74.9+/-9.8% to 31.9+/-13.6% after stenting and 28+/-23.2% at the 6-month follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 30-day composite ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate was 4.5% (2/44); at the 6-month follow-up, the ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate was 7.0%, the rate for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> was 9.7%, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality was 2.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Physician-reported follow-up in 43 patients (average of 13 months) conducted outside the study protocol (not adjudicated by the clinical event committee) reported 1 additional ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In medically refractory patients with high-grade intracranial atherosclerotic stenoses, a new treatment paradigm involving predilation with an undersized Gateway percutaneous transluminal angioplasty balloon catheter and placement of a self-expanding Wingspan stent system appears to be safe, may facilitate remodeling, and may contribute to favorable angiographic outcomes </plain></SENT>
