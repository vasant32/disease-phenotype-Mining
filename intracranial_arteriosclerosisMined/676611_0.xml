<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These patients demonstrated different degrees of disturbed intellectual and mnestic activities, a drop of attention and general activity, the speed of reactions, as well as different forms of expressed psychoorganic symptoms developing on the background of diffuse and eventually of microfocal neurological symptomatology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The REG data revealed relation between the stage of the disease on the one hand and the state of the vascular tone, elasticity of the vascular wall, level of arterial pessure and pulse blood repletion, the state of the venous outflow on the other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Changes of such parameters indicate to a prevalently functional character of these changes in the I stage and partly in the II stages of dyscirculatory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> and mainly organic in its III stage </plain></SENT>
