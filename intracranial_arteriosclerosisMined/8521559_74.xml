<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Chlamydia pneumoniae has been demonstrated in <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> of coronary arteries and aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A seroepidemiological study found C pneumoniae-specific antibody more frequently in persons with significant carotid artery wall thickening than in matched control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Fresh-frozen or formalin-fixed tissue obtained at carotid endarterectomy was examined by immunocytochemistry (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICC</z:e>) and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the presence of C pneumoniae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five of five fresh-frozen and formalin-fixed carotid endarterectomy specimens were positive for C pneumoniae by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICC</z:e> (three of five by PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 56 archival formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded carotid endarterectomy tissues from three hospitals were examined by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirty-two were positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirteen <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> carotid artery tissue sections from six patients were negative for C pneumoniae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: C pneumoniae organisms are frequently found in the advanced carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> of persons undergoing endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although these findings do not establish causality for C pneumoniae in carotid artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, they should stimulate investigation of a possible causal or pathogenic role for the organism in the disease </plain></SENT>
