<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In previous reports, the prevalence of MRI lesions varied from 11% to 59%, but many of the authors indicated a close relationship with cerebrovascular risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated 76 elderly subjects (over 60 years old, average age +/- SD was 66.7 +/- 4.5) without a history of cerebrovascular disease and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and determined the prevalence of periventricular (PVH), white matter (WMH) and pontine (PH) hyperintensity and risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The severity of MRI lesion was evaluated in T2-weighted images by Fazekas' scoring method of MRI hyperintense lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PVH, WMH and PH were graded visually from 0 to 3 by the author and these points are added to the MRI score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In T1-weighted images, we also measured the diameter of the third ventricle, frontal horn and body of the lateral ventricle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results were that 62% of subjects had PVH, 64% had WMH and 8% had PH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In regard to risk factors, 38% of subjects had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, 17% had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, 8% had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The PVH (+) group was significantly older (p&lt;0.01) and had larger lateral ventricles (p&lt;0.05) than the PVH (-) group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The WMH (+) group was significantly older (p&lt;0.05) and had higher risk of cerebrovascular disease (p&lt;0.05) than the WMH (-) group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The MRI score was related, but not significantly, to a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e>.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
