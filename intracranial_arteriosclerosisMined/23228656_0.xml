<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We assessed the safety and efficacy of the Wingspan stent (Boston Scientific, Natick, MA, USA) for the treatment of symptomatic atherosclerotic <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sixty-one patients with symptomatic <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis with narrowing of at least 70% among 61 patients were treated using Wingspan stents from March 2007 to December 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical outcomes and imaging features were recorded and analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The technical success rate was 98.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The rate of procedure-related complications during the periprocedural period (30days) was 5.0% (three of 61 patients), which included one ischemic complication and two hemorrhagic complications with no permanent neurological sequelae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean degree of stenosis decreased from 76.8±6.0% to 12.0±11.5% following treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Forty-five patients (74%) were available for follow-up imaging with digital subtraction arteriography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In-stent restenosis (ISR) was documented in seven of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A total of 61 patients were available for a clinical follow up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Four ischemic events (6.6%) occurred during the follow-up period, which were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> including two symptomatic ISR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The cumulative probability of an adverse event was 11.7% at 1year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Of the 61 patients, 51 (83.6%) had their follow-up visit more than 12months after the procedure, and no adverse events were found beyond 12months after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stenting of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> was safe and associated with a low periprocedural complication rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>It may result in a good long-term benefit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Prospective randomized controlled trials and further long-term follow up are needed to provide more adequate statistical evidence to support our findings </plain></SENT>
