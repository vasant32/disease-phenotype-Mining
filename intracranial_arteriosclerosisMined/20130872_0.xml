<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In some patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cerebral vessel occlusion, navigating mechanical thrombectomy systems is difficult due to tortuous <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> of the aortic arch, carotid arteries, or vertebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our purpose was to describe a multiple coaxial catheter system used for mechanical revascularization that helps navigation and manipulations in tortuous vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A triple or quadruple coaxial catheter system was built in 28 consecutive cases presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases were treated by mechanical thrombectomy with the Penumbra System </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In cases of unsuccessful thrombo-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo>, additional thrombolysis or angioplasty with stent placement was used for improving recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The catheter system consisted of an outermost 8-Fr and an intermediate 6-Fr guiding catheter, containing the inner Penumbra reperfusion catheters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The largest, 4.1-Fr, reperfusion catheter was navigated over a Prowler Select Plus microcatheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The catheter system provided access to reach the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral lesions</z:e> and provided stability for the mechanically demanding manipulations of thromboaspiration and stent navigation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Apart from their mechanical role, the specific parts of the system could also provide access to different types of interventions, like carotid stenting through the 8-Fr guiding catheter and intracranial stenting and thrombolysis through the Prowler Select Plus microcatheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In this series, there were no complications related to the catheter system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, building up a triple or quadruple coaxial system proved to be safe and efficient in our experience for the mechanical thrombectomy treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
