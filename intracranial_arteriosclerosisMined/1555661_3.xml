<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent reports of the risk of asymptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> have been compromised by flawed patient selection or the performance of a large number of carotid endarterectomies during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report the natural history of a randomly selected group of asymptomatic patients (n = 188; 114 males and 74 females) with documented <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery disease</z:e> who were prospectively followed without intervention for up to 8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Risk factors included <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischaemic heart disease</z:e> in 17%, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in 10%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in 46% and 88% were smokers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The degree of internal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> was classified by duplex scanning and a total of 259 vessels had evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Study end-points included <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46274">CVA</z:chebi> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At mean follow-up of 4 years 3% of the 96 patients with internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> of less than 50% had died and 2% suffered a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Six per cent of patients with a stenosis of 50-79% had died and 4% and 2% had suffered a <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46274">CVA</z:chebi> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the 59 patients with greater than 80% stenosis 7% had suffered a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> and an additional 7% a <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46274">CVA</z:chebi>, while 2% had died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>None of the patients suffering a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> had an antecedent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Though the incidence of ischaemic events is significantly higher in patients with greater than 80% stenosis the incidence of unheralded <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> remains low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We therefore continue to recommend a conservative approach to the management of asymptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
