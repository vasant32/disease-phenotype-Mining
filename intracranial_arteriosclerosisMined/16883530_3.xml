<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To explore the distribution of lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase gene (LCAT) 608C/T polymorphism in Chinese Han population and the relationship of the polymorphism association with the occurrence of atherosclerotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase gene 608C/T polymorphism is identified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP)and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) in 150 patients with ACI and 122 healthy controls matching age and sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The distribution of LCAT 608C/T gene polymorphism was in accordance with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The CT genotype frequency (14.0%) and T allele frequency (7.0%) in ACI group were significantly higher than those in control group (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The concentration of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi>) in 608CC subgroups were significantly higher than those in 608CT subgroups both in ACI group and in control group (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The LCAT 608C/T polymorphism is possibly a predisposing factor in ACI happening of Chinese Han population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>T allele frequency is possibly concerned with the metabolism of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
