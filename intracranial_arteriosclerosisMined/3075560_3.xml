<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A routine duplex investigation of the prevertebral segment of the vertebral artery was carried out in 2814 consecutive patients who were suspected for extracranial cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Depending on local anatomical properties duplex scanning failed to make a decision about the state of the ostium of the vertebral artery in 24% of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This occurred in approximately three quarters of the cases on the left side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With regard to the state of the ostium of the vertebral artery, we compared the data of duplex scanning with those of intra-arterial contrast angiography in 211 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For the detection of a stenosis with a diameter reduction of 50% or more at the site of the ostium, duplex scanning has respectively a sensitivity of 0.80, a specificity of 0.92, a positive predictive value of 0.73, and a negative predictive value of 0.94 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eighty-seven percent of the occluded vertebral arteries were correctly identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In some patients with severe multi-vessel disease, a high-flow or a low-flow state of the vertebral artery or a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038531" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">subclavian steal syndrome</z:e> did not allow a correct decision with the duplex scanner about the state of the ostium of the vertebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Significant <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> of the remaining part of the prevertebral segment of the vertebral artery were rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, this study shows that duplex scanning of this segment is very well possible and in most cases the results of the non-invasive test were in accordance with those of arteriography </plain></SENT>
