<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The investigation was carried out according to the case control method of epidemiology and conditional logistic regression model was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Multivariate analysis showed that CAS was closely related with the clinostatic systolic blood pressure (CSBP, OR: 2.13), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> (TG, OR: 2.08), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (OR: 1.31), glycosylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (OR: 1.16), recall of portrait characteristic (OR: 0.89), Kidney-Deficiency Syndrome (OR: 1.54) and Yin-Deficiency with Yang-Excess Syndrome (OR: 1.59) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>And there was a quantity-effect relationship between CSBP, TG and CAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CSBP is the most important risk factor of CAS in the special population of the old cadre, and the TCM Syndromes of Kidney-Deficiency and Yin-Deficiency with Yang-Excess are also independent risk factors of CAS </plain></SENT>
