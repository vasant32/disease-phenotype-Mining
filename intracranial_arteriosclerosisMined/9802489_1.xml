<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We compared the extent of regional distribution of tracer after external carotid artery injection of 20 to 40 MBq of 99mTc-HMPAO or 99mTc-<z:mp ids='MP_0010412'>ECD</z:mp> with that of contrast medium on the external carotid angiograms in 582 cortical regions in 12 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0543822" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">atherosclerotic occlusive disease</z:e> and in 18 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Marked accumulation of tracer was found only in the expected, specific, newly developed areas of cerebral perfusion from bypass arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The regional distribution of tracer corresponded to that of contrast medium in 523 regions (90%) and did not correspond in 59 regions (10%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Significant overestimation of the distribution of contrast material relative to that of tracer was observed in the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: SPECT showed slightly different distribution of tracer from that predicted by conventional angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>IA-SPECT should enhance the analysis of newly developed areas of cerebral perfusion from the bypass arteries </plain></SENT>
