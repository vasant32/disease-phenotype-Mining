<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Serum concentrations of adiponectin and carotid intima/media thickness (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>) were measured in 84 consecutive patients who underwent CABG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Carotid <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> both at the common carotid artery and carotid bulb level was correlated negatively and significantly (r = -0.581 and r = -0.415, respectively, P &lt; 0.01) with the serum concentrations of adiponectin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Linear regression modeling identified adiponectin as the strongest predictive variable for carotid <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> both at the common carotid artery and carotid bulb level (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Stepwise regression analyses also showed that adiponectin was the strongest independent determinant of the carotid <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> both at the common carotid artery and the carotid bulb level (F = 20.215 and F = 19.565, respectively, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean number of diseased coronary arteries, mean number of distal anastomoses, cardiopulmonary bypass time, and aortic cross-clamping time did not significantly correlate with the serum concentrations of adiponectin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The findings indicate the presence of an inverse relationship between serum concentrations of adiponectin and subclinical carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in patients undergoing CABG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In these patients, the absence of a significant correlation between severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004929'>coronary atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and adiponectin might suggest that adiponectin levels may predict the early stages rather than further progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
