<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We investigated whether cerebral microembolism as detected by transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (TCD) identifies patients at an increased risk for early, recurrent cerebral or <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> ischemic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Records of consecutive patients examined during a 40-month period in the Neurovascular Laboratory were reviewed for the presence of cerebral microembolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of the original 302 patients, 229 with 310 arteries met inclusionary criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Follow-up information was obtained from the laboratory's database as well as the hospital records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Microembolus detection studies were performed on TC-2000 or TC-2020 instruments equipped with special software, and criteria established a priori were used for microembolus selection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>TCD testing was performed a median interval of 9 days after the initial symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100545'>arterial stenosis</z:hpo> was determined by cerebral angiography or noninvasive methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Microembolic signals were detected more frequently in symptomatic (40/140; 28.6%) than asymptomatic (21/170; 12.4%) arteries (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ten recurrent ischemic events occurred during a median follow-up of 8 days after TCD examination, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> in the territories of symptomatic arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Nine events occurred in the territories of microembolic signal positive arteries (9/61; 14.8%) and one in the territory of a microembolic signal-negative artery (1/249; 0.4%) (P &lt; .00) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No association was detected in the subgroup with known cardiac lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Microembolic signals were more frequent in arteries with lesions causing 70% or more stenosis or occlusion (26/99; 26.3%) than in those with a degree of stenosis less than 70% (17/126; 13.5%) (P = .016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this retrospective study, microembolic signals were more common in the territories of symptomatic arteries and particularly those with severely stenotic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>During a short follow-up, recurrent ischemic events were more common along the territories of arteries with TCD-detected microembolism and previous symptoms of cerebral or <z:mp ids='MP_0006190'>retinal ischemia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
