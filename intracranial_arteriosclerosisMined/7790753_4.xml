<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intraplaque haemorrhage was determined in 44 of the 57 plaques (72.2%) of symptomatic patients while in the asymptomatic patients haemorrhage was noted in 12 of the 32 plaques (37.5%) p &lt; 0.001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The extent of haemorrhage was &gt; 25% of the plaque thickness in 21 of 44 symptomatic plaques (47.72%) and in the asymptomatic plaques in 3 out of 12 (25%) p &gt; 0.05 </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Communication of haemorrhage with the lumen was observed in 8 of 24 plaques (33.33%), 7 of which (29.16%) were symptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The presence of haemorrhage in the atheromatic plaque of the internal carotid artery does not seem to play any direct role in the pathogenesis of the symptoms but, nevertheless, it constitutes a significant indication of instability of the atheromatic plaque </plain></SENT>
