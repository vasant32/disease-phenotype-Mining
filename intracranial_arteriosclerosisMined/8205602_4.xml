<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Focal regions of interest were established in the cerebellum, the frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes, and the thalamus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Comparisons were made between patients age 75 years or older (very old age group) (n = 5) and those age 65 to 74 years (old age group) (n = 7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Complaints of dizziness and slight <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> disappeared by the eighth week after the start of therapy in both age groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two of the five patients in the very old age group showed elimination of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233794" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">memory disturbance</z:e> symptoms at the 12th week of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Six of the seven patients in the old age group had no <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233794" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">memory disturbance</z:e> symptoms by the eighth week of treatment, which indicates a high therapeutic effect in this group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the cerebral blood flow studies, no increases in blood flow after drug administration were observed in the very old age group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This finding is probably related to the poor level of recovery achieved in disturbances in memory in this group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast, improvements in blood flow were observed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> regions of the brain monitored in the old age group, which is consistent with the amelioration of clinical symptoms observed in these patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
