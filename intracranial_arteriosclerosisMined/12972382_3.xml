<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the prevalence of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> phenotype B and other <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> abnormalities in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> survivors with large vessel disease (LVD) or small vessel disease (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e>) (TOAST criteria) and in control subjects (CS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 30 patients with LVD and 41 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> screened out of 585 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients and 30 CS who fulfilled the following exclusion criteria: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disorders</z:e>, renal or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001399'>hepatic failure</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, or treatment with <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-lowering agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At least 3 months after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, the concentrations of total cholesterol (TC), <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi>), <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi>), <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> (TGs), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi> E (apoE), and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> (a) [lp(a)] were measured and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> phenotypes and apoE isoforms were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with LVD had significantly higher concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi> than CS (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They had higher concentrations of TGs and lower concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47775">HDL-C</z:chebi> than patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> and CS (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> phenotype B was more frequent in patients with LVD (63.3%) than in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> (39.0%) or in CS (16.7%) (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The concentration of apoE was higher in patients with LVD than in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e> or in CS (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The percentage of patients with increased level of lp(a) (i.e., &gt;30 mg/ml) was greater in patients with LVD (36.7%) than in CS (10%) (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> due to LVD, but not <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SVD</z:e>, have high prevalence of atherogenic <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> abnormalities, including increased frequency of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> phenotype B and higher percentage of increased lp(a) level, like patients with other atherogenic diseases </plain></SENT>
