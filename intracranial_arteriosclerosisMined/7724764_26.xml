<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate the use of spiral computed tomographic (CT) angiography in the analysis of the arteries of the circle of Willis and compare these results with magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) angiography and conventional angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The results in 17 patients who underwent examination were prospectively studied in a blinded fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The presence or absence of the arteries of the circle of Willis was determined by using maximum intensity projection reconstructions from CT angiography and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These results were compared with results from conventional angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Similar sensitivities were determined for CT angiography (88.5%) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography (85.5%); however, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography was found to differ significantly (P = .005) from conventional angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No significant differences (P &gt; .05) were found between the two modalities and conventional angiography in the detection of the anterior, middle, or posterior cerebral arteries or the anterior communicating artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Spiral CT angiography is highly sensitive in the detection of arterial <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> in the circle of Willis and is a reliable alternative to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography </plain></SENT>
