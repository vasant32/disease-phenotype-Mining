<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For the diagnosis of more severe lesions, additional information was obtained from disturbances in the Doppler audio spectrum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Biplane arteriography was used as a reference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The observed agreement, sensitivity, and specificity were 86.6%, 90.3%, and 88.6%, respectively, for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> lesions and 85.7%, 82.1%, and 88.6%, respectively, when only minor lesions were considered. kappa (a chance-corrected measure of agreement) was 81.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>If only blood flow abnormalities were used to detect minor lesions, 43.5% would be missed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that minor carotid artery lesions can be diagnosed noninvasively more accurately when both local blood flow irregularities and local changes in vessel wall distensibility are taken into account </plain></SENT>
