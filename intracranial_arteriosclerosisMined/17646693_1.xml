<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Few data exist about the prognostic value of serum white blood cell (WBC) count among patients with symptomatic cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the relationship between WBC count and vascular risk in patients with symptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic disease enrolled in the <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">Warfarin</z:chebi>-Aspirin Symptomatic Intracranial Disease(WASID) study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The relationships between baseline serum WBC count (categorized into quartiles) and both <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> alone and the combined endpoint of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> or vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were evaluated using the log-rank test and Cox proportional hazards regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with the quartile with the lowest WBC counts at baseline (&lt; or =5.9 x 10(9)/l), WASID subjects in both upper WBC quartiles (7.3-8.8; &gt; or =8.9 x 10(9)/l) were more likely to be younger (p = 0.022), diabetic (p = 0.013), on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> treatment (p = 0.015), or have higher mean body mass index (p = 0.015) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> (p = 0.0065) values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The rate of the primary endpoint was greater among WASID subjects in the upper two WBC quartiles compared with the lower two quartiles (28 vs. 16%, hazard ratio = 1.7; 95% CI = 1.2-2.5, p = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for baseline factors found to be significantly related to the time of primary endpoint in multivariate analysis, both upper WBC quartiles (vs. lowest quartile) were independently associated with a greater risk for the primary endpoint (hazard ratio of 1.5; 95% CI = 1.06-2.2, p = 0.024) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: An elevated WBC count at study entry was associated with an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in patients with symptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic disease enrolled in the WASID trial </plain></SENT>
