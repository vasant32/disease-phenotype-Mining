<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to prospectively study the relationship between circulating levels of inflammatory markers and fibrinolysis inhibitors, and the risk of progression of symptomatic ILA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventy-five consecutive patients with first-ever symptomatic intracranial atherostenosis were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Blood levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), E-selectin, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, intercellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule-1, matrix metalloproteinases 1, 2, 3, 8, 9, 10, and 13, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi>(a) were measured 3 months after the qualifying <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thereafter, patients underwent long-term transcranial Doppler follow-up to detect progression of ILA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During a median follow-up time of 23 months, 25 (33%) patients showed ILA progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariable adjusted Cox regression models and Kaplan-Meier curves showed that high baseline level of CRP, E-selectin, intercellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule-1, matrix metalloproteinase 9, PAI-1, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi>(a) predicted ILA progression independently of vascular risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of them, only CRP (CRP&gt;5.5 mg/L; HR, 5.4 [2.3 to 12.7]; P=0.0001) and PAI-1 (PAI-1&gt;23.1 ng/mL; HR, 2.4 [1.0 to 5.8]; P=0.05) predicted ILA progression also independently of the other studied molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Progression of symptomatic ILA is associated with a proinflammatory state, as reflected by high levels of inflammatory markers, and with defective fibrinolysis, as indicated by raised concentrations of endogenous fibrinolysis inhibitors </plain></SENT>
