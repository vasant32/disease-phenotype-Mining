<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Arterial stiffness is associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Measurement of pulse wave velocity (PWV) is one of the most representative and noninvasive techniques for assessing arterial stiffness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the association of cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> with brachial-ankle PWV (baPWV) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>If present, we sought to determine whether the relationship differed between <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in the intracranial artery and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in the extracranial artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We included 801 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> who had undergone angiographic study and baPWV measurement between January 2007 and May 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0007201'>cerebral artery atherosclerosis</z:hpo> were categorized into those with intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, those with extracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and those with both intracranial and extracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We determined factors that were associated with baPWV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that high baPWV was significantly associated with older age, lower body mass index, higher brachial systolic pressure, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Increased baPWV was associated with the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (â‰¥ 50% stenosis) in the intracranial cerebral artery as well as in both the intracranial and extracranial arteries, but not with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in the extracranial cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The burden of intracranial cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, which was assessed based on the number of arteries with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, was also closely associated with baPWV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Arterial stiffness was associated with the presence and burden of intracranial cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients, but was not associated with the extracranial cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest a potential pathophysiological association between increased arterial stiffness and intracranial cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
