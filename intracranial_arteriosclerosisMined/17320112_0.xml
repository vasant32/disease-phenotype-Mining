<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to set age standards for vascular ultrasound parameters usable in epidemiological studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Investigation was conducted on healthy volunteers (age range 25-75 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The evaluated parameters were: intima-media thickness (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>), diameter change and circumferential arterial stiffness (CAS), resistance (RI), pulsatility (PI) and A/B indexes on common carotid artery (CCA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Measurements were performed on Aloka 5500-SSD Prosound ultrasound platform in B and M modes by standard protocols </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ANOVA statistics was used for evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 104 women and 46 men, 20% were hypertensive (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> values still within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range under medication), 24% were overweight and 13% were active smokers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Investigated vascular parameters were within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> values bilaterally, RI on the right CCA and interadventitial diameters and CAS on the right CCA were found dependent to age (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>PI, A/B index, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> diameters were not found age dependant (p&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Ultrasound can be used to determine proper vascular age of individuals offering proposition of different strategies for reduction or retardation of clinical manifestation of cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
