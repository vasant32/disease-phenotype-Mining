<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The magnitude of platelet accumulation at the carotid bifurcation was expressed as the ratio of radioactivity of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30430">indium</z:chebi>-111 platelets deposited on the vascular wall to those circulating in the blood-pool (PAI, platelet accumulation index), 48 hr after injection of labeled platelets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PAI values were measured before (baseline studies) and after the antithrombotic therapies (aspirin studies: 325 mg bid for 22.3 +/- 1.3 days, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9588">ticlopidine</z:chebi> studies: 100 mg tid for 21.8 +/- 2.1 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At the baseline, the mean PAI value at 24 carotid bifurcations in the patient group was 15.7 +/- 15.3% (mean +/- S.D.) compared to -4.3 +/- 9.1 at 24 carotid bifurcations in 12 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects (p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We defined the upper limit for a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> PAI (%) value to be +13.9, namely the mean PAI plus 2 SD for the carotid bifurcation in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects and used this value for semiquantitative analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At the baseline, significant elevation of PAI (more than 13.9%; positive scintigram) was observed at 12 of 24 vessels, while 12 other regions were negative (less than 13.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the lesions with positive scintigraphic results at the baseline, the mean PAI (%) value from the baseline, aspirin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9588">ticlopidine</z:chebi> studies was 29.5 +/- 7.0, 11.2 +/- 8.5 (p less than 0.01 versus baseline) and 21.4 +/- 21.3 (not significant from baseline), respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
