<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of myocardial perfusion gated SPECT in patients with symptomatic intracranial large-artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (ILA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventy-two consecutive first-ever symptomatic ILA patients without known <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> underwent a stress myocardial perfusion gated SPECT, and long-term follow-up was conducted thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During an average follow-up of 15.2 +/- 9 months, 9 patients (13.8%) presented major coronary events (CEs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Survival analyses (Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression) identified presence of moderate-to-severe myocardial perfusion defects (log rank p = 0.004) and ejection fraction &lt;50% (p = 0.014) as predictors of future CEs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neurovascular ischemic events were not predicted by SPECT variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Myocardial perfusion scintigraphy predicts future CEs in patients with symptomatic ILA and may be helpful to guide therapeutic strategies in this subgroup of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
