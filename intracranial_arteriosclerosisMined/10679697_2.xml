<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Because recent data are conflicting, it is not certain whether <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo> is an independent risk factor for cerebrovascular diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Decreased cerebrovascular reserve capacity refers to the decreased ability of the cerebral arterioles to adapt in critical conditions and probably predicts a higher risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to compare cerebrovascular reserve capacity in hyperlipidemic patients and healthy controls using transcranial Doppler sonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-four hyperlipidemic patients and 21 healthy controls were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With transcranial Doppler sonography, the mean blood flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery was registered at rest and at 5, 10, 15, and 20 minutes after intravenous administration of 1,000 mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cerebrovascular reactivity and reserve capacity were calculated from mean blood flow velocities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Various laboratory measurements were also made and assessed for correlation with resting cerebral blood flow velocity and cerebrovascular reserve capacity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No significant differences could be observed between controls and hyperlipidemic patients in cerebrovascular reactivity or cerebrovascular reserve capacity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No correlation was found between various laboratory measurements and resting cerebral blood flow velocity or cerebrovascular reserve capacity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We could not demonstrate any differences in cerebrovascular reserve capacity between hyperlipidemic patients and healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, the vasodilatory ability of the cerebral arterioles seems to remain unchanged in this patient group and is not correlated with the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
