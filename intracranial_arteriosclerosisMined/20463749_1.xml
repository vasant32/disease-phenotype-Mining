<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Many hypertensive patients, however, suffer from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> long before they have any signs of cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, this study examines direct effects of blood pressure on neurotransmitter status in the hippocampus, a vulnerable cerebral structure relevant for memory consolidation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Absolute <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> concentration and N-acetylaspartate (<z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>) concentration as an alternative marker of neuronal integrity were determined in the hippocampus and the cerebral cortex (anterior cingulate cortex; ACC) by 3-T proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy in 16 probands without any history of cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Memory function was tested by the auditory verbal learning test (AVLT) and the rivermead behavioural memory test (RBMT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Arterial stiffness was assessed by augmentation index (AI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean arterial pressure showed a significant negative age-adjusted correlation to absolute <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> concentrations in the hippocampus (R=-0.655, P=0.011), but not in the ACC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no significant correlation of mean arterial pressure and <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi> in either hippocampus or ACC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>AI did not affect hippocampal <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, there was a significant negative correlation between mean arterial pressure and AVLT (r=-0.558, P=0.025) and RBMT score (r=-0.555, P=0.026) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There is an inverse relation between blood pressure and the concentration of hippocampal <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">Glutamate</z:chebi> is essential for long-term potentiation, the neurobiological correlate for memory formation in the hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Thus, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> may not only be mediated by structural atherosclerotic wall changes, but also by functional changes in neurotransmission </plain></SENT>
