<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: The comparison of the two methods was made in 110 volunteers (mean age 31.9 +/- 11.5 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study protocol included measurement of blood pressure (BP), blood <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, evaluation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> of the carotid arteries by ultrasonography, baseline stiffness index (SIbl) and after sublingual <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28787">nitroglycerin</z:chebi> (SIng) by photoplethysmography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Reproducibility of photoplethysmography was evaluated in 20 volunteers (mean age 20.3 +/- 1.4 years) with repeated measurement after 1 week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results were tested in 40 volunteers of different age groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were significant correlations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>, SIbl and SIng with risk factors and close interrelations of these parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SIng better explained variability of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> compared to SIbl (r = 0.79, R2 = 0.62, p &lt; 0.001 versus r = 0.67, R2 = 0.45, p &lt; 0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Relations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> with risk factors were lost after correction for SIng </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Reproducibility of SIng was higher than SIbl (+/- 5.1% versus +/- 10.9%, respectively) and than those for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> found in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> values for random sample evaluated by ultrasonography and calculated by estimated equation of linear regression for SIng and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> did not differ significantly (0.576 +/- 0.087 mm versus 0.570 +/- 0.074 mm, p = 0.44; r = 0.71, p &lt; 0.001, mean difference 0.007 +/- 0.051 mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The method of vascular stiffness measurement is comparable with ultrasonography in terms of vessel structure evaluation and possesses higher reproducibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The test with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28787">nitroglycerin</z:chebi> substantially increases its diagnostic potential and reproducibility </plain></SENT>
