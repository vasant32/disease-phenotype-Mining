<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the levels of serum <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> between spouses had little or nearly no correlation; and that between mid-parent and their children had positive or significant positive correlation, and so did that between siblings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It seems that the genetic factor have an important influence on levels of serum <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> in members of nuclear families of patients with arteriosclerotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
