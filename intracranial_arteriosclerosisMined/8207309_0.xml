<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>61 subjects with CAD (mean age 62 years) and significative lesions (&gt; 50%) underwent periodic Echo-Doppler (Duplex scanning) of the supra aortic branches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Total serum cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> and fibrinogen were monitored, as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A 24 month follow-up period was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Indicative of the progression of carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> has been considered the presence of a stenosis degree over 20% than the initial one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 14 of the 61 subjects who entered the study, there was evidence of progressive carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The same patients showed higher levels of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> (130 +/- 36.3 vs 96.5 +/- 33.2) and Fibrinogen (398.3 +/- 59.4 vs 328 +/- 36.8) and lower levels of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> (27.2 +/- 4.2 vs 34.4 +/- 10.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results confirm the importance of cholesterol and fibrinogen as determining risk factors, especially in patients with multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> (coronary and carotid) </plain></SENT>
