<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to present 12-month follow-up results for a series of patients undergoing percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stenting with the Gateway-Wingspan stenting system (Boston Scientific) for the treatment of symptomatic intracranial atherostenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Clinical and angiographic follow-up results were recorded for patients from 5 participating institutions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Primary end points were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> within 30 days of the stenting procedure or ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> after 30 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During a 21-month study period, 158 patients with 168 intracranial atherostenotic lesions (50% to 99%) were treated with the Gateway-Wingspan system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The average follow-up duration was 14.2 months with 143 patients having at least 3 months of clinical follow-up and 110 having at least 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cumulative rate of the primary end point was 15.7% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients and 13.9% for patients with high-grade (70% to 99%) stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of 13 ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> occurring after 30 days, 3 resulted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of these <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, 76.9% (10 of 13) occurred within the first 6 months of the stenting procedure and no events were recorded after 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An additional 9 patients experienced ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> after 30 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Most postprocedural events (86%) could be attributed to interruption of antiplatelet medications (n=6), in-stent restenosis (n=12), or both (n=1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In 3 patients, the events were of uncertain etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: After successful Wingspan percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stenting, some patients continued to experience ipsilateral ischemic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Most of these ischemic events occurred within 6 months of the procedure and were associated with the interruption of antiplatelet therapy or in-stent restenosis </plain></SENT>
