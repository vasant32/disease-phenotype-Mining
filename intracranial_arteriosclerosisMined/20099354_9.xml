<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Contrast-enhanced high-resolution (0.51 x 0.58 x 2 mm(3)) MRI images were acquired through internal (ICA) and common carotid arteries (CCA) of 2066 ARIC participants at four sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sixty-one exams were repeated and 164 pairs had repeated interpretations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Plaque component thicknesses, areas and volumes over eight slices (1.6-cm segment) were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intraplaque <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> was recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Reliability was evaluated by intraclass correlations and kappa statistics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 1769 successful MRI exams (mean age 71 years; 57% females; 81% white; 19% African-Americans) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Repeat scan reliability was highest for CCA lumen area (0.94) and maximum wall thickness (0.89), ICA lumen area (0.89) and maximum wall thickness (0.77) and total wall volume (0.79), and lowest for small structures-core volume (0.30) and mean cap thickness (0.38) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall reliability was primarily related to reader variability rather than scan acquisition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>K's for presence of core, calcification and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> were fair to good </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>White men had the thickest plaques (average maximum ICA wall thickness = 2.3 mm) and the most cores (34%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The most important limiting factor for MRI measurements of plaque components is reader variability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Measurement error depends largely on the analyzed structure's size </plain></SENT>
