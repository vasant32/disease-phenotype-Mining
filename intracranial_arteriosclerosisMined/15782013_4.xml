<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The outcome evaluation for the revascularization of intracranial vascular stenoses has not been fully described due to the highly technical nature of the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report here on the early and late clinical outcomes of angioplasty and/or stenting of symptomatic severe intracranial vascular stenoses at a single institute </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Since 1995, we have treated 35 patients with symptomatic intracranial <z:mp ids='MP_0005412'>vascular stenosis</z:mp> (more than 70% stenosis, mean stenosis: 78.6%+/-6.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Angioplasty (n = 19) was performed for the horizontal segment of the middle cerebral artery (M1) (n = 16) and the basilar artery (BA) (n = 1), the intradural vertebral artery (VA) (n = 1), and the cavernous internal carotid artery (ICA) (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Stenting (n = 16) was performed for the cavernous or petrous ICAs (n = 9), the intradural VA (n = 3), BA (n = 2), and M1 (n = 2) artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We assessed the angiographic success (defined as residual stenosis &lt; 50%) rate, the periprocedural complications during the 30-day periprocedural period, the symptomatic recurrence and restenosis during a mean 22-month follow-up (FU) period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Kaplan-Meier estimate of the cumulative event-free rate of the major cerebrovascular events, i.e. <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or restenosis, was also done </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Angiographic success was achieved in 97% of our patients (34/35) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were four procedure-related complications (11%) including a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and a minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>During the mean 22-month FU, the asymptomatic restenosis rate was 9% and the symptomatic restenosis rate was 6% in the target lesion and 9% in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the vascular territories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The Kaplan-Meier estimate was 70.6% (95% confidence interval = 46.5-94.7) after 33 months of FU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In addition to a high angiographic success rate and an acceptable periprocedural complication rate, intracranial angioplasty and/or stenting revealed a relatively low symptomatic recurrence rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>Hemorrhage</z:mp> is a rare, but the physician must aware that potentially fatal periprocedural complications can occur </plain></SENT>
