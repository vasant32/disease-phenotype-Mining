<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this investigation was to provide a detailed description of the angiographic results after stenting of high-grade intracranial stenosis using balloon-expandable stents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Forty consecutive patients with symptomatic atherosclerotic intracranial stenosis &gt;50% received endovascular treatment by placement of balloon-expandable stents using the concept of slight underdilation and strict avoidance of overdilation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Intra-arterial digital subtraction angiography images before and after stenting in the same projection were reviewed for pre- and post-therapeutic measurement of the degree of stenosis and evaluation of morphologic criteria like plaque coverage, stent apposition, patency of side branches, and signs of dissection or vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Stenting decreased the mean percentage stenosis from 76.2 (WASID criteria) to 20.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Residual stenosis ranged from 0 to 55% with residual stenosis &gt;50% in two of 40 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Technical success rate was 95% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no major vessel complications, but minor abnormalities like incomplete stent apposition (8/40) or plaque coverage (7/40), incomplete filling of side branches (13/40), and minor dissections after stenting (2/40) were seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One case with incomplete stent apposition and two cases with side branch compromise were associated with clinical symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, intracranial stenting with slight underdilation avoided major vessel complication and created reliable <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> gain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Suboptimal recanalization results were frequently detected and may be the source of neurological complications in individual cases </plain></SENT>
