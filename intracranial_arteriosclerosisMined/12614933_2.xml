<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies reported good correlation between <z:hpo ids='HP_0002597'>vascular abnormalities</z:hpo> and OCSP mainly in populations not at risk of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There have been limited data on the relationship between intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and the OCSP classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive Chinese patients admitted to a regional hospital with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> were studied in Hong Kong </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> subtype was classified as total or partial anterior circulation <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> (TACI or PACI), posterior circulation <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> (POCI), or lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> (LACI), according to the OCSP method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Transcranial Doppler (TCD) was performed whenever possible to evaluate the intracranial arteries as well as the carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>National Institute of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) was used to assess the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> on admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Six hundred and ninety-nine consecutive patients were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On admission, 24 patients were classified as TACI (3.4%), 96 PACI (13.7%), 111 POCI (15.9%), and 468 LACI (67.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of the 345 patients who had TCD evidence of intracranial or carotid artery abnormalities, 75% had intracranial involvement only, 5% extracranial involvement only and 20% had both intracranial and extracranial involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The frequencies of arterial abnormalities were found in 58% of TACIs, 48% of PACIs, 48% of POCIs and 50% of LACIs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was no evidence that the frequencies of arterial abnormalities were different between the OCSP groups (P=0.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Middle cerebral artery velocity was abnormal in 9 TACIs (38%), 32 PACIs (33%), 35 POCIs (32%) and 177 LACIs (38%) (P=0.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Vertebrobasilar velocities were abnormal in 4 TACIs (17%), 20 PACIs (21%), 29 (26%) and 87 LACIs (19%) (P=0.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The OCSP subtypes were associated with POCIs the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>NIHSS score of &gt; or =9 was found in 83% of TACIs, 18% of PACIs, 9% of POCIs, and 12% of LACIs (P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: OCSP classification is not significantly related to the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002597'>vascular abnormalities</z:hpo> among patients with predominantly intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
