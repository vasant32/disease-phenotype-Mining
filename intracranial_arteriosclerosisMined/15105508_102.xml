<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This multicenter, nonrandomized, prospective feasibility study evaluated the NEUROLINK System for treatment of vertebral or intracranial <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients were 18 to 80 years old with symptoms attributed to a single target lesion of &gt; or =50% stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients received 5 neurological examinations before and in the year after the procedure, and another angiogram at 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 61 patients enrolled, 43 (70.5%) intracranial arteries (15 internal carotid, 5 middle cerebral, 1 posterior cerebral, 17 basilar, 5 vertebral) and 18 (29.5%) extracranial vertebral arteries (6 ostia, 12 proximal to the posterior inferior cerebellar artery [PICA]) were treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the first 30 days, 4 patients (6.6%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> and no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Successful stent placement was achieved in 58/61 cases (95%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At 6 months, stenosis of &gt;50% occurred in 12/37 (32.4%) intracranial arteries and 6/14 (42.9%) extracranial vertebrals, 4 in the vertebral ostia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Seven (39%) recurrent stenoses were symptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Four of 55 patients (7.3%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> later than 30 days, 1 of which was in the only patient not stented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The NEUROLINK System is associated with a high rate of successful stent deployment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Strokes</z:hpo> occurred in 6.6% of patients within 30 days and in 7.3% between 30 days and 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Although restenoses occurred in 35% of patients, 61% were asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Further trials involving the NEUROLINK System are warranted </plain></SENT>
