<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We therefore investigated whether high hair mercury content is associated with accelerated progression of carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, determined by ultrasonographic assessment of common carotid intima-media thickness (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>), in a prospective study among 1014 men aged 42-60 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a linear regression model adjusting for other atherosclerotic risk factors, high hair mercury content was one of the strongest predictors of the 4-year increase in the mean <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> (P2.81 microg/g (fifths) had an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> increase of 0.105, 0.102, 0.113, 0.107 and 0.140 mm/4 years, respectively (P=0.041 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> between groups) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> increase was 0.034 mm/4 years (31.9%) greater in the highest fifth than in the other fifths (P&lt;0.05 for the difference) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that mercury accumulation in the human body is associated with accelerated progression of carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
