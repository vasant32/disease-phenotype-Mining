<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, specific data from undeveloped countries is difficult to obtain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Natives from South America may have a higher frequency of penetrating small vessel disease and hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, there are few studies in South America supporting these findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We analyze demographic, ethnic, risk factors, clinical characteristics, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> admitted to our hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> consecutive <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients admitted to the Ramos Mejia Hospital in Buenos Aires from 1997 to 1999 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our hospital serves a determined population of Southern Buenos Aires </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Data were collected prospectively on patients' admission in a form especially designed for this study including vascular risk factors, clinical features, epidemiological characteristics, and neuroradiological findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> subtypes were determined according to the TOAST classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 361 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients, 31% had hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It was more frequent among Natives (34%) than Caucasians (27%) (P&lt;0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>Ischemic stroke</z:hpo> subtypes were as follows: 105 (42%) patients had lacunar, 31 (12%) atherosclerotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, 53 (21%) cardioembolic infarction, and 16 (6%) other causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Forty-five (18%) patients were classified as undetermined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Small vessel disease was higher among Caucasians (35%) than Natives (24%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Penetrating artery disease (42%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> (31%) were the most common <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes, being more frequent than reported in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Natives had significantly higher frequency of hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> than Caucasians </plain></SENT>
