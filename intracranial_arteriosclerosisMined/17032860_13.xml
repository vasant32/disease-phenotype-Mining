The long-term clinical neurologic and angiographic outcomes of angioplasty and/or stent placement for intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in a consecutive series of patients are presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The demographics, procedural details, procedural outcome, and long-term neurologic follow-up in 60 consecutive patients with 71 lesions, undergoing a total of 84 procedures, were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Angioplasty alone was performed in 62 procedures; 22 procedures involved stent placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The periprocedural <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>+<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate was 4.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The overall complication-free success rate was 90.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Restenosis occurred in 23 lesions at a mean of 4.6 months; 13 were re-treated without complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were 4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> and 4 non-neurologic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> during 224 patient-years of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The annualized <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate was 1.8%, and the annualized <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>+<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate was 3.0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rates in this consecutive series of patients with severe intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis treated with optimal endovascular therapy are considerably less than those associated with the natural history of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> treated with maximal medical therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Intracranial angioplasty with conditional stent placement is technically feasible and clinically effective with a substantial reduction in long-term <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
