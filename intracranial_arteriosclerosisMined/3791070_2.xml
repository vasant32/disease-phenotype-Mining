<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied the chronologic course of cognitive performance over 1-4 years in seven patients with known ischemic cerebrovascular disease whose <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> subtype was assigned according to the clinical history and the pattern of white matter lesions seen on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One patient had the lacunar state, three had subcortical arteriosclerotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> and three had multiple cortical and subcortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> were being treated with an antiplatelet agent and six received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four of the seven vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patients improved cognitively over the first year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A fluctuating course was eventually seen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>None showed stepwise deterioration of cognitive function over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The MRI was useful in subclassifying vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> patients, but the clinical course did not appear to vary as a function of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> subtype </plain></SENT>
