<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The database of the CAIUS study was examined in order to investigate the presence of a relationship, if any, between the activity of pravastatin on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> progression rate and its hypocholesterolemic effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Quantitative B-mode ultrasound imaging was used to quantify the individual mean maximum <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> progression rate in 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the overall group of patients (placebo and pravastatin) covariance analysis showed that while the variable 'treatment' (0 = placebo, 1 = pravastatin) was significantly related to the reduction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> progression (F= 6.6, P = 0.01), the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> progression did not correlate with the extent of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi> lowering (F= 0.00, P = 0.98) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To further investigate this issue. the pravastatin treated group was stratified into quartiles of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi> reduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast to what was observed in the placebo group, in which a positive mean <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> progression rate was observed, independent of the extent of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi> reduction, no <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> progressionwas observed in any subgroup treated with pravastatin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant difference was found among quartiles and no trend could be identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the effect of pravastatin treatment on carotid <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> progression rate is beneficial; however the CAIUS study demonstrated that lowering <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi> by itself, does not explain the variability of beneficial changes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> </plain></SENT>
