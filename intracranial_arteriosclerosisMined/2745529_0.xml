<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>At 189 operations in 174 patients, carotid artery stump pressure (CSP) was measured serially to determine variability during carotid endarterectomy with eucarbic general anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Overall, 34 of 174 (19.5%) had significant variation in CSP which would have affected selective use of a bypass shunt based on CSP criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In those with CSP initially below 50 torr, 26 of 76 (34%) rose above 50 torr even, though systemic pressure was constant or declined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eight of 113 pts (7%) with initial CSP equal to or above 50 torr subsequent had CSP below 50 torr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CSP did not vary as a function of age, sex, intracranial disease judged by biplanar arteriography, or contralateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> but did vary with preoperative status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Asymptomatic patients had CSP above 50 torr in a high proportion of cases, 24 of 27 (89%) unlike those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>, 72 of 116 (62%) or prior <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, 17 of 31 (54%) (P = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that carotid stump pressure is variable in many patients which may account for some of the conflicting observations on the need for shunts in carotid surgery </plain></SENT>
