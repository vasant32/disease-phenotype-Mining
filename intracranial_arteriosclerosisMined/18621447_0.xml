<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we wish to address this issue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 476 subjects from Chinese Han ethnic population were investigated, including 152 control individuals and 324 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Genotyping of R219K and V825I were performed by PCR-RFLP analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data were analyzed using a statistical package </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The R219K genotype frequency distributions were significantly different between patients with atherothrombotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> (ACI) and control individuals, with fewer KK genotypes and more RR genotypes in ACI patients (chi(2)=9.89, P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The K allele is less frequent among ACI patients than in controls (chi(2)=9.16, P&lt;0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A significant association of KK with decreased ACI risk was exhibited, especially in male patients, aged patients and individuals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that the K allele of R219K polymorphism is an independent protective factor against ACI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, though there is no association of V825I with ACI, this polymorphism may have certain synergistic effect with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in susceptibility to ACI </plain></SENT>
