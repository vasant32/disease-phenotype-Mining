<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Many authors have postulated that angulation of the carotid artery is a cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and recommend corrective operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Symptoms attributed to such lesions are often nebulous and unrelieved by the operation, and proof is lacking that unselected patients who have this condition have a risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> exceeding operative risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A review of 282 cerebral angiograms showed an incidence of elongation and potential angulation of 43 percent in children and 20 percent in adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Acutal angulation was not found in children, however, and no child was suspected of having <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of 47 adults with potential angulation, 17 were suspected of having <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, the remainder having a variety of other lesions, such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the 17 having suspected <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had alternative explanations for their symptoms (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>), except one whose symptoms were completely inappropriate to the carotid distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A single patient had a completed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, demonstrable angulation, and only mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Elongation and potential angulation of the carotid artery is common but usually coexists with other lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>If the finding is postulated as the cause for neurologic morbidity the surgeon must be assured that symptoms are clearly neurologic, that no other cause exists, that angulation reduces the carotid lumen significantly and reproduces symptoms, and that the risk of operation is less than the expected risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in untreated patients </plain></SENT>
