<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the safety and efficacy of the treatment by using Wingspan stents in arteries of this caliber </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: From March 2007 to July 2010, 53 symptomatic intracranial stenoses with narrowing of at least 50% in 53 patients were treated by using Wingspan stents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical manifestations and imaging features were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The technical success rate was 98.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no serious complications, with the exception of 1 patient who experienced a small <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> caused by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> of microwire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirty-nine patients (74%) were available for follow-up imaging with DSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>ISR was documented in 13 of these patients, including 2 patients with symptomatic ISR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median length of the vascular lesions was 5.39 mm, and patients whose vascular lesions were longer than 5.39 mm had a much higher incidence of ISR than patients whose vascular lesions were shorter than 5.39 mm (53% versus 15%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The median ratio of the reference artery diameter to the stent diameter was 0.78, and patients whose ratio was smaller than 0.78 had a much higher incidence of ISR than patients whose ratio was larger than 0.78 (53% versus 15%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In our series, percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stent placement of small intracranial arteries by using Wingspan stents was safe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The ISR rate was relatively high; most patients having ISR were asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Further follow-up is needed to assess the long-term efficacy of this procedure </plain></SENT>
