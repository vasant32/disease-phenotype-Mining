<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, our own findings and those described in the pertinent literature are compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In three of our own cases considerable calcification of the intima and media of the persistent artery have been demonstrated histologically, On the other hand only a slight involvement of the blood vessel from which it originates and of that one into which it flows as well as of the other arteries of the base of the brain has been observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This suggests to be the result of special flow and pressure relationships of the blood, and interpreted as locus minoris resistentiae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The discrepancy between the frequency of the neuroradiological demonstration and the clinico-neuropathophysiological importance of the anastomosis, on the one hand, and the obtaining of neuropathological autopsy findings, on the other, has been pointed out </plain></SENT>
