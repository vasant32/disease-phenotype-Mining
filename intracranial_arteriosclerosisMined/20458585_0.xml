<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We reviewed the 69 consecutive stent placement procedures for symptomatic atherosclerotic stenosis (≥70) in M1 segment of middle cerebral artery in 67 patients in 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>According to the stent types, the patients were classed as BMS and SES groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The demographic characteristics, conventional risk factors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, degree of stenosis, periprocedural complications, stent types, and clinical and angiographic outcomes were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were 39 patients in the BMS group and 28 patients in the SES group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The demographic characteristics, conventional risk factors, and periprocedural complications were similar but different in residual stenosis after stenting in both groups (5.9% ± 9.9% vs. 14.4% ± 14.6%; P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For the overall cohort, the rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and restenosis was 10.9% (7/66) and 24.5% (14/57), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The frequency of restenosis was higher in the SES group than in the BMS group (log-rank, P = 0.04; crude hazard ratio = 3.03; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.01-9.15; P = 0.049; and adjusted hazard ratio = 3.61; 95% CI, 1.06-12.27; P = 0.04); however, there was no difference in clinical outcomes (log-rank, P = 0.51; crude hazard ratio = 1.66; 95% CI, 0.36-7.61; P = 0.51; and adjusted hazard ratio = 0.59; 95% CI, 0.04-7.89; P = 0.69) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The corrected degree of restenosis was higher in the SES than the BMS group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of restenosis was higher in the SES than the BMS group, but the perioperative complications and follow-up clinical outcomes had no significant difference </plain></SENT>
