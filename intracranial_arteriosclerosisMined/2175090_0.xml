<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The alterations were found to be attended by activation of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation and deterioration of the cerebral and central hemodynamics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The treatment with the calcium <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7565">nifedipine</z:chebi> favoured an increase in the content of prostacyclin and reduction of the content of TxB2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>That was associated with improvement of the hemodynamic parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It may be assumed that the vasodilatory effect of the calcium <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> is related to stimulation of the synthesis of prostacyclin  </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Besides, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7565">nifedipine</z:chebi> treatment brought about a decrease in the blood plasma of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation products, which may be an additional factor of prostacyclin synthesis activation </plain></SENT>
