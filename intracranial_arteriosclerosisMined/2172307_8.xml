<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Comparison between atherogenesis assessed first by histology then by ultrasonography allowed us to differentiate young from old plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An old plaque is characterized by a dense <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> echo pattern and irregular borders or ulceration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have shown a correlation between the presence of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> and ulceration of atheromatous plaques in the carotid, and the frequency of cerebral complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Since these characteristics were mainly found in older plaques, we consider them to be the most important ones clinically </plain></SENT>
