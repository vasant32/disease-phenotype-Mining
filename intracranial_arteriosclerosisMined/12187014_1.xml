<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Proper assessment of intracranial arteries by transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD) in patients with intracranial stenoses is occasionally made difficult by an insufficient temporal bone window, an unfavourable insonation angle, or low flow velocity or volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This condition is frequently found in Chinese </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In these cases, echocontrast could be helpful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated 48 temporal windows of 24 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> Chinese <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with insufficient native transtemporal insonation conditions before and after the application of the echo enhancer Levovist (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="28260">galactose</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15756">palmitic acid</z:chebi>) by an injection pump </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We classified the signal quality from four segments of the main intracranial arteries: anterior cerebral artery (A1), main stem of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>, M1), intracranial segment of the carotid artery (C1), and posterior cerebral artery (P1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The signal quality was classified as follows: 0 = no signal, 1 = poor, envelope curve does not follow spectrum, 2 = adequate, envelope curve follows spectrum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As compared to the pre-contrast scans, echocontrast allowed for more segments to be evaluated by pulsed Doppler sonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Before Levovist, only 12% of the segments could be detected, after Levovist 63% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> arteries, signal quality was better after Levovist, p between 0.0180 and 0.0003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 3 patients, <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenoses with peak systolic Doppler flow velocities above 160 cm/s were found only after Levovist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In patients with poor pre-contrast detection, echocontrast-enhanced TCD allows for more arterial segments to be insonated and for the detection of stenoses unnoted during the non-enhanced investigation </plain></SENT>
