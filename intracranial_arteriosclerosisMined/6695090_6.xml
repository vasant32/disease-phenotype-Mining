<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The application of ultrasound to clinical evaluation of the symptomatic patient requires less precision and accuracy than when it is used as an instrument to study atherogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The clinician's goal is to locate hemodynamically significant lesions; studies of atherogenesis require auxometry (measurement of the growth of lesions) and the instruments used must have a sensitivity matched to an average growth rate that can be expected in a general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This dictates that ultrasound equipment be designed specifically for high resolution imaging and the target vessels of choice appear to be the carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Correlations of disease patterns among various vessel beds indicate that inferences can be made between coronary and carotid vessels on a population level, but should not be made on an individual basis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>While the ultimate goal of the cardiologist is to be able to do repetitive, accurate, noninvasive scanning of coronary arterial lesions, present technology limits us to making such inferences about <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary disease</z:hpo> from the best available substitute </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The carotid appears to be the artery of choice for this purpose because of its proclivity toward developing the disease and its ready availability for clinical scanning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is an important target in its own right, and should be of interest to cardiologists given the likelihood that the coronary bypass patient will tend to develop <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in the cerebral system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The ideal noninvasive imaging equipment for today's clinician is one which offers flexibility in being able to image various vessel beds with the same transducer head </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This flexibility, however, may not be appropriate for equipment which is designed for auxometric application </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Rather, lesion tracking image systems will need to be designed for narrow application: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> variables will be controlled to maximize precise visualization of the carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>If we were to project an ideal, hypothetical carotid scanning device to track lesion change over one year, it would probably have the following characteristics: It would be a B-mode imaging system rather than a Doppler in favor of ther increased axial resolution offered by B-mode </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It would function at 8 MHz to 10 MHz to provide maximum axial resolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The crystal would be the maximum size permitted by <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The near/far field transition would be focused at the depth of the carotid (1 cm to 2 cm) to offer maximum azimuthal resolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The system would utilize a head positioner to orient the patient's neck the same way on repeat scans.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
