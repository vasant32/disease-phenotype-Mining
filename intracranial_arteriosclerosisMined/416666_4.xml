<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The epidemiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the Africans is reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The frequencies in hospital populations varied from 0.9% to 4.0% and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> accounted for 0.5% to 45% of neurological admissions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There is male predominance in published series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The main risk factors are <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and homozygous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sickle cell disease</z:e> (in children only) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is by far the commonest clinical type encountered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These conclusions are further supported by experience at Ibadan, of over 1100 Africans seen over 18 years reported briefly in this communication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results of the first community study over a 2-year period on the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in an African Urban (Ibadan) Community are presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The study was carried out as part of a multinational multicentric study initiated and sponsored by the World Health Organization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The male to female ratio was five to two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Incidence rates reached peaks in the eighth decade in males and in seventh decade in females and were higher in males in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> age groups, and the rates are comparable with those recorded in European populations, except in those under the age of 40 in Ibadan, in which age-specific incidence rates are considerably lower than in European and Japanese populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> constituted the main risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Mortality and recurrence rates are described and are similar to experience in the Caucasians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> in the Nigerians predispose to a high frequency of cerebrovascular disease other than through mainly cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>With increasing longevity of Nigerians and other Africans, the mortality and morbidity caused by cerebrovascular disease would probably become of enormous dimensions and adequate control of <z:mp ids='MP_0002842'>high blood pressure</z:mp> on a community basis may be the only way of preventing this: this would be desirable as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> in contradistinction to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0152105" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypertensive heart disease</z:e> is an uncommon complication of <z:mp ids='MP_0002842'>high blood pressure</z:mp> in the Africans and prevention of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0152105" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypertensive heart disease</z:e> as shown by experience elsewhere can be achieved by control of <z:mp ids='MP_0002842'>high blood pressure</z:mp>, which does not seem to prevent ischaemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0878544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myocardial disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
