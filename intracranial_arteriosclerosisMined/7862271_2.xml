<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to evaluate the diagnostic reliability of turbo spin-echo (TSE) sequences compared to a conventional dual-echo spin-echo (SE) sequence in routine brain MRI at 1.0 T </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The following demands were made on TSE sequences: acquisition time-reduction of at least 50% and true proton density (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>) contrast (low-signal cerebrospinal fluid) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A conventional spin-echo and two single-echo TSE sequences were used in 150 patients, a dual-echo TSE sequence in addition in 50 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Demonstration of most anatomical structures and disorders was equivalent with TSE and SE sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Advantages of TSE were reduced flow artefacts on T2-weighted images, better lesion contrast on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>-weighted TSE images (especially in the dual-echo sequence) and acquisition time reduction to about 5 min (single-echo TSE) and 3:35 min (dual-echo TSE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Disadvantages of TSE were: reduced contrast of iron-containing substances such as haemosiderin and of areas of calcification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By virtue of the shorter acquisition time and diagnostic reliability dual-echo TSE proved the best sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>If it is used with only one acquisition--whereby image quality but not diagnostic reliability is slightly decreased--acquisition time can be further reduced to 1:48 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Application of a susceptibility-sensitive gradient-echo sequence, such as FLASH, compensates for the disadvantages mentioned above </plain></SENT>
