<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Recent post-mortem studies have reported that the severity of atheromatous deposits in the circle of Willis is significantly greater, relative to non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> (ND) elderly persons, in subjects with neuropathologically diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the severity of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> correlates significantly with the densities of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100256'>neuritic plaques</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002185'>neurofibrillary tangles</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examine the arteries of the circle of Willis by transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: TCD was used to measure, in 25 AD patients and 30 ND elderly subjects, mean flow velocities and pulsatility indices in 16 different segments of the circle of Willis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The data were compared with and without adjustment for age, gender and systolic blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The AD patients had systematically higher pulsatility indices (p&lt;0.005) than the ND group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Incremental increases of pulsatility indices in these segments had odds ratios ranging from 1.8 to 48 for the presence of AD when adjusted for age, gender and systolic blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The left internal carotid artery siphon and the left posterior cerebral artery were the two vessels that were strongly associated with AD diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean flow velocities were generally lower in patients with AD but the differences did not reach the significance level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: The pulsatility indices of the arteries of AD patients were generally greater than those of similarly-aged ND subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This difference is most likely due to increased arterial wall <z:hpo ids='HP_0002063'>rigidity</z:hpo> imposed by atherosclerotic changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Atherosclerotic disease of intracranial arteries may be a risk factor for AD </plain></SENT>
