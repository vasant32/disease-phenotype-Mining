<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The distribution of lesions was separately assessed by a computer technique and results were displayed as contour lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Lesions are most frequent on the outer walls of the bifurcations and on the inner curvature of the arterial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011119" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bends</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The material was processed for histology, and computerised morphometry was used to study the interrelationship of microscopic atheromatous lesions and intimal thickening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The percentage of the specimens with lesions around the circumference of the arteries was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The peaks and troughs The peaks and troughs of histological lesions correspond exactly to the maximum and minimum contours of the macroscopic studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results from the microscopic examination indicate that intimal thickening and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> are closely related processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, they cannot support the view that focal pad-like areas of intimal thickening are particular precursors of atheroma </plain></SENT>
