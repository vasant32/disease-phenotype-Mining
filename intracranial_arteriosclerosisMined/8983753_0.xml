<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been shown that cardil increases significantly cerebral bloodflow predominantly on the side of the stenosis, does not cause intracerebral "stealing" in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of insult, improves bloodflow to the brain and collateral blood supply in the residual phase due to selectivity of its influence on cerebral vessels, lowers arterial pressure, decreases frequency of contractions, as well as cardial and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> indices, and volume of circulating blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The drug suppresses aggregatory properties of thrombocytes and erythrocytes during different stages of ischemic insult, and makes blood viscosity somewhat less </plain></SENT>
