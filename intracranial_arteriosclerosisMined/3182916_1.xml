<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Carotid endarterectomies (CE) and patch graft angioplasty totalled 192 (166 patients); an enlarging patch graft angioplasty of the internal carotid artery (ICA) without CE was performed in 14 cases (13 patients); in the remaining four surgical procedures (3 patients), for technical reasons prohibiting CE, the operation consisted of a great saphenous vein bypass between a donor vessel and the ICA distal to the lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The preoperative symptoms in 182 patients were as follows: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> (98 cases, 54%), non-hemispheric symptoms (21 cases (12%) and fixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or TIAIR (10 cases, 5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifty-three patients (29%) were asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, continuous EEG monitoring was employed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The operation was performed without a temporary intraluminal shunt in the patients showing tolerance to carotid clamping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The protection of the shunt was required only in patients with EEG changes (47 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The arteriotomy was routinely closed with a <z:chebi fb="15" ids="53251">PTFE</z:chebi> patch graft angioplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Early results of the operation were excellent: none of the patients presented permanent or transient neurological deficits in the immediate postoperative period and none of them died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were reassessed with C.W </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Doppler sonography and Duplex scanning in the postoperative period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, the success of the operation was demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Longterm follow-up (6-72 months, mean follow-up: 35 months) was done in 121 patients (142 operations): 107 patients were completely asymptomatic, 5 remained stable or slightly improved the preoperative status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Five patients had a new or recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo>, 3 suffered a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, one showed a recurrence of non-hemispheric symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>With the exception of two patients suffering a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had a second arteriography but none of these patients showed extracranial lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Two patients presented an asymptomatic restenosis of the ICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Eight patients (8.8%) revealed a significant evolution of the disease of the contralateral unoperated ICA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
