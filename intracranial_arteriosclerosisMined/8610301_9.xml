<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to elucidate the prevalence and degree of asymptomatic occlusive lesions in the carotid and intracranial arteries in Japanese patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IHD</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed carotid and intracranial <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography (MRA) on 67 patients (49 men, 18 women; age range, 40 to 78 years; mean age, 60.1 years) who had received selective coronary angiography for the clinical diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IHD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On the basis of these images, degree of stenosis in the regions of the bilateral carotid artery bifurcation and five regions of the intracranial arteries, ie, bilateral intracranial portions of the internal carotid arteries and the middle cerebral arteries and the basilar artery were estimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Stenosis of more than 25% narrowing of the diameter of the target arteries was found in 15 patients (22.4%) in the extracranial carotid arteries and in 11 patients (16.4%) in the intracranial arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most of the stenotic lesions were mild </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The incidence of extracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> and the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004929'>coronary atherosclerosis</z:hpo> showed a significant correlation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean age of the patients with intracranial arterial lesions was statistically higher than those without intracranial lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that asymptomatic occlusive lesions in the carotid and intracranial arteries are fairly common in Japanese patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IHD</z:e>, although the degree of stenosis is relatively mild </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Coexistence of carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> should be suspected in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IHD</z:e> patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0004929'>coronary atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, and the possibility of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in the intracranial arteries should be considered in aged <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IHD</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
