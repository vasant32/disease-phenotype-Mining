<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report phosphodiesterase (PDE4D) gene polymorphism and its correlation with MRA findings in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Consecutive patients with MRI proven <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> undergoing MRA were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The severity of atherosclerotic stenosis on MRA was categorized into moderate 50%-80%, severe 80%-99%, and total occlusion 100% using NASCET criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The polymorphism in SNP 32, SNP 83 and SNP 87 of PDE4D gene was analyzed by PCR both in the patients and in 188 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among the 148 patients, MRA was abnormal in 77% patients; ECMRA in 53.8%, ICMRA in 66% and both were abnormal in 42% patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The frequency of CC genotype of PDE4D83 was significantly higher in the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> compared to controls (OR 3.38, 95% CI 1.61-7.11, P= 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The frequency of TT genotype of PDE4D87 was significantly higher ICMRA abnormalities (20%) compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ICMRA (2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The genotype and allele frequency of PDE4D83 and PDE4D32 were not significantly related to MRA abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The role of PDE4D87 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> needs confirmation in larger studies </plain></SENT>
