<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: For this study, we enrolled 428 consecutive in-patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were examined with transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (TCD) and carotid duplex ultrasound to detect <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> in intracranial and extracranial cerebral arteries, some also were examined by magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and/or digital subtraction angiography (DSA), they were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> diagnosed as atherosclerotic cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients were divided into three groups according to the different location of lesions, the frequency of risk factors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and the demographic parameters were compared among these groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 199 cases (46.5%) had only intracranial <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp>, 129 cases (30.1%) had only extracranial <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp>, 100 cases (23.4%) had both intracranial and extracranial stenosis (combine group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared with the other two groups, the levels of total cholesterol and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">low density lipoprotein-cholesterol</z:chebi> of the intracranial artery group are both significantly higher (TC: P(1) = 0.001, P(2) = 0.000; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi>: P(1) = 0.004, P(2) = 0.039), the combine group had a significant higher ratio of male than that of the intracranial artery group(P = 0.003), there were no any other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> risk factors had association with the location of cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The occurrence of stenosis in intracranial arteries is more frequent than that in extracranial arteries in Chinese patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, and the <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> level is higher in the intracranial artery group, most risk factors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> may not be major determinants of location for cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
