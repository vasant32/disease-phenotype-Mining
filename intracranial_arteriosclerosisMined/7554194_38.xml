<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The relationship between the intake of dietary and supplemental <z:chebi fb="122" ids="21241">vitamin C</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22470">alpha-tocopherol</z:chebi>, and provitamin A <z:chebi fb="2" ids="23044">carotenoids</z:chebi> and average carotid artery wall thickness was studied in 6318 female and 4989 male participants 45 to 64 years old int he <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>Atherosclerosis</z:hpo> Risk in Communities Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Intake was assessed by use of a 66-item semiquantitative food-frequency questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Carotid artery intima-media wall thickness was measured as an indicator of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> at multiple sites with B-mode ultrasound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among men and women &gt; 55 years old who had not recently begun a special diet, there was a significant inverse relationship between <z:chebi fb="122" ids="21241">vitamin C</z:chebi> intake and average artery wall thickness adjusted for age, body mass index, fasting serum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, total caloric intake, cigarette use, race, and education (test for linear trend across quintiles of intake, P = .019 for women and P = .035 for men) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An inverse relationship was also seen between wall thickness and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22470">alpha-tocopherol</z:chebi> intake but was significant only in women (test for linear trend, P = .033 for women and P = .13 for men) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a significant inverse association between <z:chebi fb="7" ids="23042">carotene</z:chebi> intake and wall thickness in older men (test for linear trend, P = .015), but the association weakened after adjustment for potential confounders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No significant relationships were seen in participants &lt; 55 years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data provide limited support for the hypothesis that dietary <z:chebi fb="122" ids="21241">vitamin C</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22470">alpha-tocopherol</z:chebi> may protect against atherosclerotic disease, especially in individuals &gt; 55 years old </plain></SENT>
