<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The enormous intra-personal variation in the plasma concentration of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi>(a) is almost entirely controlled by the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi>(a) i.e. gene locus on the chromosome 6q 26-27 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi>(a) molecule is highly polymorphic and is known to exist in multiple, genetically determined isoforms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These polymorphisms may be responsible for difference in promoter activity, variable size of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">apolipoprotein</z:chebi>(a) and thereby variation in plasma <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi>(a) concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We studied the effect of two types of polymorphisms, (i) variation in length of the pentanucleotide repeat in the 5' flanking region starting -1373 bp upstream of AUG codon, and (ii) the Kringle-4 type 2 size polymorphism, on plasma <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi>(a) levels in North Indian population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The study group consisted of 88 angiographically assessed male <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> patients (age range 30-70 years) and 83 age- and sex-matched healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The pentanucleotide repeat polymorphism was analysed using polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 8/11 pentanucleotide repeat isoforms were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Using <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="2511">agarose</z:chebi> gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting isoforms having 12-50 Kringle-4 type 2 repeats were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our study indicates a strong association of elevated plasma <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi>(a) concentration with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>An inverse correlation was seen between <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> concentration and isoform size for both the pentanucleotide repeat polymorphism and the Kringle-4 type 2 polymorphisms; statistically significant difference (p = 0.001) was, however, observed only for the later </plain></SENT>
