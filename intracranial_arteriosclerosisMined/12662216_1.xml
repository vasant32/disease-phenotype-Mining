<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We performed cerebral magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) on 123 HD patients without symptomatic cerebrovascular disease and on 52 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On the basis of these images, we investigated the prevalence and risk factors of AOL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Stenosis greater than 25% narrowing of the cerebral arteries was found in 27 HD patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of AOL of cerebral arteries in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> patients was significantly higher than in the control group [27 (22.0%) versus 4 patients (7.7%), chi.2=4.2, p=0.0411] </plain></SENT>
