<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The incidence of new ABI was investigated in an observational prospective study of 1410 men and women, mean age 81 +/- 9 years, with prior <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> and a serum <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> of &gt;or=125 mg/dl treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> (679 persons or 48%) and with no <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-lowering drug (731 persons or 52%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Follow-up was 36 +/- 21 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At follow-up, the stepwise Cox regression model showed that significant independent predictors of new ABI were age (risk ratio = 1.04 for a 1-year increase in age), cigarette smoking (risk ratio = 3.5), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (risk ratio = 3.1), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (risk ratio = 2.3), initial serum <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> (risk ratio = 1.01 for each 1 mg/dl increase), initial serum <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high-density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> (risk ratio = 0.97 for each 1 mg/dl increase), prior <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (risk ratio = 2.5), and use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> (risk ratio = 0.40) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Cochran-Armitage test showed a trend in the reduction of new ABI in persons treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> as the level of serum <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> decreased ( p &lt;.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> caused a 60%, significant, independent reduction in new ABI in older men and women with prior <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> and a serum <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> of &gt;or=125 mg/dl </plain></SENT>
