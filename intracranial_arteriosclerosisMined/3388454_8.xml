<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The level of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> was greater in the large arteries of the circle of Willis than in the small arteries, and autopsy-verified <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> was strongly associated with increasing severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Analyses of the association of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> scores with biologic and lifestyle characteristics measured at entry into the study indicated that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in the large arteries was consistently related to age, diastolic blood pressure, serum cholesterol, and height (inversely) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Weak trends of association were also found with increasing serum <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration, increasing cigarette use, and decreasing alcohol intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>Atherosclerosis</z:hpo> scores in the small arteries were associated with diastolic blood pressure and serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analysis of dietary intake indicated that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> scores were higher for men who reported low intakes of fat and animal protein and high intakes of vegetable protein and total carbohydrates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These patterns were consistent with similar findings on the incidence of clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in this cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Age-adjusted and -specific <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> scores from both the large and small arteries declined significantly during the period 1965-1983 </plain></SENT>
