<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The author reports 57 stenosis or occlusions of the internal carotid artery, 13 dissections and 44 atheromatous lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>She studies the correlation between intracranial collateralisation detected by transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD) and clinical symptoms as well as lesions seen on cerebral CT-scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two types of ischaemic lesions are described: border-zone <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, probably haemodynamic in origin and territorial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, probably thromboembolic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>TCD lets suppose that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> in this series have a thromboembolic origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the other hand it is possible that collateralisation depending on both anterior and posterior communicating arteries is not sufficient, because such a collateralisation is found above <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> in the 2 most severe symptomatic groups and in many territorial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the atheromatous group, occlusions are often asymptomatic and territorial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> less extended, whereas in the dissections group <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> occlusions determined a territorial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, often very important </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>TCD alone doesn't allow to definitely conclude about pathogeny of ischaemic lesions nor on collateralisation value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The adjunction of <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> reactivity tests in middle cerebral artery will perhaps give the clues of these problems </plain></SENT>
