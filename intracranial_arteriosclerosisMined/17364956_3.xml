<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 61 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients and 64 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Strokes</z:hpo> were subtyped according to TOAST criteria, the severity and outcome of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (at 1 year) were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi>, fibrinogen, CRP and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> values were significantly higher among cases </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The oxLDL values did not correlate with age, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> severity and outcome </plain></SENT>
