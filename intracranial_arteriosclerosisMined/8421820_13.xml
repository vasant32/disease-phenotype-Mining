<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The present study was performed to determine the relation between distribution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and risk factors in Japanese patients with atherothrombotic occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 154 patients with atherothrombotic occlusion of the extracranial internal carotid artery (n = 75, ICA group), the horizontal portion of the middle cerebral artery (n = 47, <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> group), and the basilar artery (n = 32, BA group), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of which were confirmed by cerebral angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the distribution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> of the three sites and compared the risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> between the three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used 113 subjects without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> as the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A strong correlation was present between <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> of the extracranial internal carotid artery and that of the basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, only a weak correlation existed between <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> of the middle cerebral artery and that of the other vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although the prevalence of smoking and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> was higher and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> levels were lower in the three groups than in the control subjects, no significant differences were found in age, sex, prevalence of smoking and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, serum levels of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> among the three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and the serum levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> A1c, total cholesterol, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">low density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi> were higher in the ICA and BA groups than in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of electrocardiographic evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001712'>left ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo> was higher in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> group than in the other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In addition to smoking, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and low concentration of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47775">high density lipoprotein cholesterol</z:chebi>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo> seem to be associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> of the extracranial internal carotid artery and the basilar artery, and advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> may play a role in the development of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
