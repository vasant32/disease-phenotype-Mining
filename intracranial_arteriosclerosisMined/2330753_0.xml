<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cerebral hemodynamics was found to be relatively independent of the central one in patients with early atherosclerotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo>; the level of the systemic circulation and that of the median regional cerebral flow were found to correlate in early and advanced hypertensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cerebral function was shown to be more associated with the cerebral flow in the early <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> in elderly patients than in middle-aged ones </plain></SENT>
