<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Stent placement for intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> has become an alternative treatment technique; however, stent placement for middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) stenosis remains a technical and clinical challenge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our purpose was to assess the feasibility, safety, and effectiveness of stent placement for <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between May 1998 and August 2003, we performed stent placement for <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis (more than 50%) in 17 patients and retrospectively analyzed the technical success rate, complications, and outcomes over 10 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Stent placement was technically successful in 16 (94.1%) patients and failed in one patient (5.9%), because the stent did not reach the lesion due to carotid artery tortuousity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 16 patients, postprocedural angiography showed restoration of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> in-stent thromboses occurred in nine patients (56.3%) and was lysed with abciximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The parent artery ruptured in two patients (12.5%): One died from massive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, and the other patient received a second stent over the tear site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Stent jumping (distal migration at the time of balloon inflation) occurred in one patient (6.3%) and was solved by implanting a second stent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Periprocedural complications included <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> in-stent <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (n = 1, 6.3%) and minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (n=1, 6.3%); these were relieved with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> therapy or local thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients experienced symptomatic relief or were stable at follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Angiographic follow-up (n=6) revealed no in-stent restenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Stent placement for symptomatic <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis was technically feasible and effective in alleviating symptoms and improving cerebral blood flow </plain></SENT>
