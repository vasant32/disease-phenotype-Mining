<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the relation between CRP concentrations and the severity of stenosis of cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">Lipid</z:chebi> parameters and CRP levels were measured in the sera of 119 patients with stenosis of the extracranial cerebral arteries established by angiography and compared with the control group, with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> appearance of the cerebral arteries on ultrasound examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CRP concentrations were determined by a high-sensitivity assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CRP concentrations showed a statistically significant difference in the group of patients with cerebrovascular stenosis of more than 70% compared to the control group (median value 3.4 vs. 1.5 mg/l in the control group, p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At logistic regression analysis, CRP was significantly associated with stenosis of more than 70% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In addition to traditional biochemical risk markers, an elevated CRP level measured on automated analysers using a high-sensitivity assay may be useful in the detection of patients with severe stenosis of the cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
