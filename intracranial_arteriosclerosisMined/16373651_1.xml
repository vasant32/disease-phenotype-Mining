<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We systemically evaluated the distribution of carotid arterial lesions in Chinese patients with transient monocular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000618'>blindness</z:hpo> (TMB), which was rarely reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We prospectively evaluated 105 consecutive patients with TMB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the patients received ocular and physical examinations, blood tests for coagulation function and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo>, and ultrasonography of cervical and intracranial arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the carotid lesions were confirmed by magnetic resonance angiography or cerebral angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 36 (34.3%) patients with significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> (&gt; or =50%), 16 (15.2%) had extracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo>; 17 (16.2%) had carotid siphon stenosis; and 3 (2.9%) had both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The duration, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, and patterns of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> were not different between patients with and without carotid arterial lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study signified the importance of carotid siphon stenosis as a probable underlying etiology for TMB in Chinese patients </plain></SENT>
