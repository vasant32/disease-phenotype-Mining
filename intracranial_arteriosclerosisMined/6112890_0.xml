<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> was assessed by funduscopy and the test persons divided into four groups: without of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo>, mild and medium <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo>, respectively, and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The automatic measurement of reaction time was repeated in the majority after certain interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results of the two examinations have been compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It has been found that delay of reaction time showed substantial relationship with the severity of cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> and exceeded the relationship with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Longitudinal examination gave evidence that during aging delay of reaction time showed an even speed, i.e. age does not influence speed of delay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Contrariwise regression was found to be essentially more rapid in the groups with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> with poor incipient values </plain></SENT>
