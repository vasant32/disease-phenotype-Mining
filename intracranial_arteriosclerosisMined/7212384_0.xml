<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Alterations in the heart rate, blood pressure and blood flow in the internal carotid artery and brachial artery were studied by means of the on-line Doppler ultrasonic apparatus before, during and after the maneuvers, simultaneously and continuously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Aschner Test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>Bradycardia</z:hpo>, biphasic alteration of blood pressure, increase of blood flow in the internal carotid artery and decrease of blood flow in the brachial artery were observed in the maneuver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The changing rate of the findings was diversified individually </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, no significant difference was observed between the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> young males and the elderly patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Side effects consisted of slight and transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo> and dizziness in 6 subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Czermak-Hering Test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>Bradycardia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo>, and decrease of blood flow in the brachial artery were observed in the maneuver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The changing rate of the findings is more conspicuous in the elderly patients than in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> young males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Alterations in the blood flow in the internal carotid artery were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was a conspicuous increase of the blood flow in the internal carotid artery on the noncompressed side during the maneuver in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> young males and in half of the elderly patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The remainder of the elderly patients showed either no alteration or decrease of the blood flow in the internal carotid artery on the noncompressed side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Slight <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo> in 2 subjects, slight dizziness in 5 subjects, and moderate disturbance of consciousness in 1 subject were observed as side effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that the Czermak-Hering test will be more advantageous in investigating the autonomic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> function (vasovagal reflex) and autoregulation of cerebral circulation in elderly subjects </plain></SENT>
