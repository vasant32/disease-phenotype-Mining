<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We previously demonstrated a strong relation between carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (defined as carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> &gt; or =50%) and intracranial artery calcification (IAC) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relation between aortic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and IAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four hundred fifty-four patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Complex aortic plaques (CAP) were assessed by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and defined as plaques &gt; or =4 mm thick or with mobile components in the proximal aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IAC were assessed in the seven major cerebral arteries and a semiquantitative score system was applied, ranging from 0 (no calcification) to 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Forty-two patients (9.3%) had CAP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with CAP were older compared with patients without CAP (73.6 vs. 63.6 years, p &lt; 0.001), had more vascular risk factors, more significant carotid artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (p &lt; 0.001), more <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">kidney disease</z:e> (p &lt; 0.001), and a higher IAC score (3.0 vs. 1.8; p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Stepwise logistic regression selected the following independent factors for CAP: previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> (OR 3.3; 95%CI 1.5-7.0; p = 0.002), carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> &gt; or =50% (OR 3.7; 95%CI 1.7-8.0; p = 0.001), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">kidney disease</z:e> (OR 3.8; 95%CI 1.9-7.8; p &lt; 0.001), and IAC score (OR 1.5; 95%CI 1.2-1.9; p = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>IAC was present in 100% of patients with CAP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, IAC had a high sensitivity (100%) and negative predictive value (100%) for the presence of CAP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients, the absence of IAC strongly points to the lack of CAP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, these results warrant confirmation in prospective studies before concluding the non-utility of the use of TEE to exclude CAP as a potential source of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> in patients without IAC </plain></SENT>
