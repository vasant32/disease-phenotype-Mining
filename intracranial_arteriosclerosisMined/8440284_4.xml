<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The relationship between blood velocity and residual lumen diameter at the origin of 100 internal carotid arteries was studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The diameter was measured by angiography and blood velocity by relatively simple Doppler ultrasound equipment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A scatter diagram between maximal velocity and diameter was used to construct a table on the sensitivity and specificity of various cutoff values for maximal velocity to diagnose stenoses of different degrees </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A maximal velocity &gt; or = 0.8 m/s had a sensitivity of 87% and a specificity of 93% to diagnose stenoses with a diameter &lt; or = 3 mm (i.e. more than 50% diameter reduction) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, simple recording of maximal velocity can be used as a reliable screening method to detect patients with high- and medium-grade stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the spectral spreading of velocities across the lumen of a stenosis, or estimation of percent stenosis from the velocity in a stenosis and that in a poststenotic segment, were in our hands less useful for this purpose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>None of the methods were good to detect or exclude the presence of low-grade stenosis </plain></SENT>
