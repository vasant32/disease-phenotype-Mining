<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Intracranial vertebral arteries of 30 patients and carotid arteries of 62 patients were studied with spin-echo magnetic resonance imaging with contrast enhancement and spatial presaturation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Arterial wall enhancement was graded as follows: stage 1, no substantial enhancement; stage 2, faint or thin area of enhancement; stage 3, definite and thick area of enhancement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In vertebral arteries, stage 3 enhancement was seen in 11 patients (mean age, 73.7 years) and stage 1 in eight (mean age, 56.4 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In carotid arteries, stage 3 enhancement was seen in 13 patients (mean age, 71.0 years) and stage 1 in 21 patients (mean age, 39.0 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In both arteries, stage was well correlated with age (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Arterial wall enhancement is related to aging and is probably due to neovascularity in association with atherosclerotic plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This finding may permit assessment of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
