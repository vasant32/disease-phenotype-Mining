<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: We sought to determine the frequency, predictors, and consequences of hemodynamic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>) after carotid artery stenting (CAS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Hemodynamic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> has been reported after carotid artery stenting CAS and carotid endarterectomy (CEA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data on 500 consecutive CAS procedures performed over a 5-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hemodynamic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> was defined as periprocedural <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> (systolic blood pressure &lt;90 mm Hg) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> (heart rate &lt;60 beats/s) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Univariate and multivariate binary logistic regression models were used to determine the predictors and consequences of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> and persistent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 70.5 +/- 10 years, and 69% were men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hemodynamic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> occurred during 210 procedures (42%), whereas persistent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> developed in 84 procedures (17%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Features that independently predicted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> included lesions involving the carotid bulb (odds ratio [OR] 2.18 [range 1.46 to 3.26], p &lt; 0.0001) or the presence of a calcified plaque (OR 1.89 [range 1.25 to 2.84], p &lt; 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Prior ipsilateral CEA was associated with reduced risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> (OR 0.35 [range 0.20 to 0.60], p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients who developed persistent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> were at a significantly increased risk of a periprocedural major adverse clinical event (OR 3.05 [range 1.35 to 5.23], p &lt; 0.02) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (OR 3.34 [range 1.13 to 9.90], p &lt; 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Hemodynamic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> is common after CAS, particularly in patients with a calcified plaque in the carotid bulb, but is easily treated with conventional methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients who develop persistent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> are at an increased risk of periprocedural major adverse clinical events and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
