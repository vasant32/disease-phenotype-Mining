<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to analyze the reliability of calculated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> by the Friedewald formula compared with measured <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> after separation by ultracentrifugation in 202 male patients with extracoronary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (100 patients with ischemic cerebrovascular disease and 102 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>peripheral vascular disease</z:hpo>) and in 117 health control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Calculated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> coincided with measured <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, with less than 10% error, in 118 patients (58.4%) with extracoronary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and in 87 controls (74.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Calculated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> was overestimated, with an error of 10% or more compared with measured <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, in 34.6% of patients and 22.2% of controls, and underestimated in 6.9% and 3.4% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Despite a good correlation between calculated and measured <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, the intraclass correlation coefficients demonstrate a poor concordance between calculated and measured <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi>, both in patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The authors underline the need for caution in assessing the reliability of calculated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
