<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Each patient is always submitted to the following investigations: Duplex scanner of epiaortic vessels, Transcranial doppler and echocardiographic screening in our vascular laboratory; moreover, when haemodynamic carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> is present, duplex scanner of femoro-popliteal vessels and microcirculatory study of the brain with Zenon133, via inhalation, were undertaken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the second part of the study the authors refer a relationship between the instrumental doppler signal and the real risk evidenced by techniques which can provide information on the composition, structure and stability of the plaques and correlate this information with the data from the doppler analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Instrumental techniques such as thermal analysis, atomic absorption spectroscopy, ICP analysis and IR spectroscopy were used to carry out this study </plain></SENT>
