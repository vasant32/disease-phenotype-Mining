<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of GH deficiency (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GHD</z:e>) and replacement on the cardiovascular system according to gender </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: The design was open and prospective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: The study was conducted at a university hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS: Subjects included 36 severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0003581'>adult-onset</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GHD</z:e> patients (18 men, 20 women, aged &lt; 45 yr); 36 gender-, age-, and body mass index-matched healthy subjects served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: Subjects received GH replacement at a median dose of 6.5 microg/kg.d in men and 7.7 microg/kg.d in women for 2 yr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Homeostasis model assessment index, total to <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> ratio, fibrinogen and C-reactive protein levels, left ventricular mass index, blood pressure, heart rate, diastolic filling, and systolic function at rest and at peak exercise and intima-media thickness (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>) at common carotid arteries were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Basal prevalence and/or degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> alterations, compromised cardiac function, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> were similar in women and men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Diastolic dysfunction was more prevalent in men (61 vs. 25%, P = 0.036) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After GH replacement, IGF-I levels normalized in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">Lipid</z:chebi> profile, fibrinogen, and C-reactive protein levels normalized in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The total to <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> ratio (P = 0.04) was higher in women than men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The homeostasis model assessment index persisted higher in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GHD</z:e> patients than controls and decreased only in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GHD</z:e> men (P = 0.017) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Left ventricular mass index normalized during treatment in both women and men, abnormal diastolic function persisted in three women (P = 0.031), and abnormal systolic performance persisted in six women and one man (P = 0.13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> decreased similarly in women and men, persisting higher than in controls </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Two-year GH replacement has similar beneficial effects on cardiac and exercise performance and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in women and men with severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GHD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
