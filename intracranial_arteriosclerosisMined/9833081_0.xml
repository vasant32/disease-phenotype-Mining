<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to identify the similitudes and the differences in the epidemiology and prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accidents</z:hpo> by analysis of trials of primary and secondary prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accidents</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The principal risk factors common to both pathologies are <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, smoking and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003141'>increased LDL-cholesterol</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the statistical significance with respect to causality differs from one pathology to the other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Similarly, the impact of preventive measures is not the same: the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> is more important in the prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accidents</z:hpo> than <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>; the situation is the other way around with respect to the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020443" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypercholesterolaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the therapeutic interventions, aspirin is effective in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> stages of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> but does not prevent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accidents</z:hpo> in patients without documented <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thrombolysis carries a much higher benefit/risk ratio in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> than in that of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The so-called cardioprotective drugs, such as the betablockers and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35457">angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors</z:chebi>, have only been used to any extent in the secondary prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These differences reflect the fact that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accident</z:hpo> covers a range of diseases much more diverse than does <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, and also that the brain is much more exposed to haemorrhage whereas cardiac haematoma is highly unusual </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> is a later event than <z:hpo ids='HP_0004929'>coronary atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and this has epidemiological implications which are difficult to assess </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> and of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accidents</z:hpo> may proceed theoretically by a common pathway but in practice, it is very different </plain></SENT>
