<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Genotypes were determined by the polymerase chain reaction with oligonucleotide flanking of the polymorphic region of intron 16 of the angiotensin-converting enzyme gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Results of angiotensin-converting enzyme genotyping showed 46% of 50 studied patients to be homozygous for the DD allele, whose prevalence was significantly increased as compared with a group of controls without atherosclerotic changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this control group, the following genotypes were observed (%): II = 24, ID = 52 and DD = 24 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The frequency of the I and D alleles in the group of patients with cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> was 0.28 and 0.72, respectively, whereas in the group without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> it was 0.50 for both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in the present study, the DD genotype was associated with a high level of serum angiotensin-converting enzyme activity, total and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> and triacylglycerol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A newly established association between DD genotype and cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, detected even in our small group, supports the view that angiotensin-converting enzyme polymorphism might be indicative of the development of cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
