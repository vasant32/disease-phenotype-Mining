<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate whether genetic variations in the eNOS gene were associated with intracranial and extracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in Koreans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed data on 282 consecutive Korean patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in intracranial (ICAS) or extracranial vessels, and compared with 300 healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The eNOS gene polymorphism was analyzed by PCR and direct sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> genetic variants were single nucleotide polymorphism, two in the coding sequence (C774T and G894T) and one in intron 6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The frequency of the G894T polymorphism was significantly higher in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0004929'>coronary atherosclerosis</z:hpo> group than in the control group, but its presence did not correlate with other clinical risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in genotype and allele frequencies between <z:hpo ids='HP_0004929'>coronary atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and ICAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The G894T polymorphism in the eNOS gene might influence <z:hpo ids='HP_0004929'>coronary atherosclerosis</z:hpo> rather than ICAS in Koreans </plain></SENT>
