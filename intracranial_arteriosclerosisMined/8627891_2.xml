<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005299'>premature peripheral vascular disease</z:hpo> may respond differently than their older counterparts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine the impact of early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> on outcome, we decided to compare a group of these patients with a group of patients with typical <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> with regard to early complications, indications for intervention, site of disease at initial presentation (aortoiliac, infrainguinal, or cerebrovascular), and long-term outcomes (secondary revascularization, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_686'>amputation</z:mpath>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients younger than 50 years old requiring operative intervention between 1987 and 1992 were retrospectively compared with a group of patients greater than 60 years old, randomly selected from patients who underwent operation during the same time period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were evaluated and compared for indications, risk factors, and early and late outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> at the aortoiliac or infrainguinal level had a higher late <z:mpath ids='MPATH_686'>amputation</z:mpath> rate (17% versus 3.9%, p = 0.02) and poorer overall outcome than their older cohorts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with cerebrovascular disease in both cohorts had similarly good prognoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Aortoiliac or infrainguinal disease diagnosed in patients less than 50 years of age portends a poorer outcome than does similar disease in an older patient population </plain></SENT>
