<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="7565">Nifedipine</z:chebi> was demonstrated to potentiate relaxation effect of prostacyclin at the level of sarcolemmal calcium transport, while cavinton and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4653">dipyridamole</z:chebi> had an analogous influence, redistributing calcium in the intracellular stores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The potentiating effect of these drugs was also less pronounced in affected vessels, which might be connected to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> of transport ATPase activity in the vascular smooth muscle cells </plain></SENT>
