<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cerebral angiography was conducted on 85 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clipping or wrapping of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was performed on 81 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The overall good outcome (GR and MD in the Glasgow Outcome Scale) ratio and mortality rate were 43% and 34%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The good outcome ratio and mortality rate in operative cases were 59% and 12%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With regard to the timing of the operation, 77 cases (95%) underwent early operation and 4 cases (5%) underwent delayed operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The good outcome ratio of patients with grade I to III at surgery using the Hunt and Kosnik grading system was 74% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in outcome between the patients with a ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> in the anterior circulation and those with one in the posterior circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The retrospective analysis of the overall outcomes showed the risk factors as being: age over 70 years, cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, poor grade on Hunt and Kosnik grading system and symptomatic vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Preoperative <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain swelling</z:e> at surgery, and postoperative symptomatic vasospasm were factors which worsen the outcome of surgically treated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with more than 2 factors showed worse outcomes than those with only one factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The utilization of these prognostic factors should be important to improve the outcome of patients with aneurysmal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
