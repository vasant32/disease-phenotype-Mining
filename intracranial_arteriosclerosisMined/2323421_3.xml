<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A better understanding of the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and of post surgical intimal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> can be obtained by analysis of the cellular composition of the lesions using immunohistochemical techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we have compared human atherosclerotic plaques obtained as endarterectomy specimens from the carotid artery, with lesions induced by mechanical injury and cholesterol feeding in rats and rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Antibodies to cell type-specific antigens were used to identify cells, and visualisation was with enzyme-conjugated second antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our data show that the <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> core region of the human plaque is dominated by macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Such cells also dominate the lesions of cholesterol-fed rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, intimal lesions induced by balloon catheters in rats consist almost entirely of vascular smooth muscle cells, with a small inflammatory infiltrate of monocytes and T lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This situation resembles that in the fibrous cap region of the human plaque </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the human lesion contains a much higher proportion of T lymphocytes and macrophages than the experimental one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> types of lesions, class II major histocompatibility antigens were induced on the cells, suggesting that an immune reaction with activation of T lymphocytes may be taking place </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Finally, different subpopulations of smooth muscle cells were observed, possibly representing different degrees of differentiation or a response to immune mediators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our studies demonstrate that different experimental models resemble the human disease in various aspects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The choice of experimental model will therefore depend on the problem to be studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The balloon catheter model should be ideally suited for studies of intimal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> after surgery and also for studies of fibrous cap formation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
