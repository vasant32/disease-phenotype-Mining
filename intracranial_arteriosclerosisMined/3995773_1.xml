<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> was significantly reduced in male and female patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> decrease was due to a fall in both HDL2 and HDL3 cholesterols; nonetheless, an analysis of the HDL2-cholesterol/HDL3-cholesterol ratio disclosed that HDL2 cholesterol was the most reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Slightly higher plasma cholesterol and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels were found in the patients as well as a higher plasma cholesterol/<z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, the HDL2-cholesterol/HDL3-cholesterol ratio was significantly reduced in the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These preliminary findings suggest that, as in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e>, the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL cholesterol</z:chebi> reduction in cerebral and peripheral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> is also mainly due to a reduction in the HDL2 subfraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results also lend further support to the proposal that determination of the <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> subfractions is useful for a better assessment of the risk profile for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
