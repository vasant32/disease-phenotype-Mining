<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>From the pathoanatomical point of view subcortical arteriosclerotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> probably is related to cerebral small vessel disease, leading to lacunar state and white matter <z:hpo ids='HP_0011096'>demyelination</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Brainstem lacunes are rarely found by CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>But electrophysiological methods are easily employed to demonstrate brainstem dysfunction and demyelinating lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We now report our electrophysiological findings in 43 patients showing clinical and CT-morphological signs of subcortical arteriosclerotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The latencies of visual evoked potentials (VEP) in 36% of these patients were found to be significantly different from those measured in healthy persons aged more than 65 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>About 75% of the subcortical arteriosclerotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> patients had abnormalities of the electrically elicited blink reflex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 26 patients blink reflex and VEP were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In only 6 of them the electrophysiological findings were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
