<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The incidence of new coronary events and of new ABI was investigated in an observational prospective study of 529 diabetics, mean age 79 +/- 9 years, with prior <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> and a serum <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> of &gt;/=125 mg/dl treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> (279 persons or 53%) and no <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi>-lowering drug (250 persons or 47%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Follow-up was 29 +/- 18 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At follow-up, the stepwise Cox regression model showed that after controlling for other risk factors, the use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> was associated with a 37% significant independent reduction in the incidence of new coronary events and with a 47% significant independent reduction in the incidence of new ABI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> was associated with a 37% significant, independent reduction in new coronary events and a 47% significant, independent reduction in new ABI in older men and women with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, prior <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, and a serum <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> of &gt;/=125 mg/dl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Elderly diabetics with prior <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> and increased serum <z:chebi fb="1" ids="47774">LDL cholesterol</z:chebi> should especially be treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
