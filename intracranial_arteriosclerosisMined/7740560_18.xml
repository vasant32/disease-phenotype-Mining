<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39015">Apolipoprotein</z:chebi> E (apoE) epsilon 4 allele has been associated with a high risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Increased frequency of the epsilon 4 allele has also been reported in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> familial and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> (AD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the degree of coronary and cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in a neuropathologically verified series of AD patients with different apoE genotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, we studied the relationship between the degree of coronary and cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and the extent of beta-amyloid (A beta) accumulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 38 subjects (32 patients with definite AD and 6 age-matched control subjects) for whom postmortem autopsy delay was less than 8 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ApoE genotypes were identified through Hha I digestion of the polymerase chain reaction-amplified samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We used A beta immunohistochemistry to detect diffuse and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100256'>neuritic plaques</z:hpo> as well as cerebrovascular amyloid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The degree of coronary and cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> was rated as none, mild, moderate, or severe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The apoE genotypes of the AD patients were epsilon 4/4 2, epsilon 3/4 19, epsilon 3/3 9, and epsilon 3/2 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We found more severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> of the coronary vessels among AD patients with the apoE epsilon 4 allele compared with those AD patients without the epsilon 4 allele (chi 2 = 4.1, df = 1, P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The extent of cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> did not differ among AD subgroups with and without the epsilon 4 allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The degree of coronary or cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> was not related to the amount of amyloid accumulation in the frontal and temporal cortices or in the hippocampal structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the association of apoE epsilon 4 allele with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004929'>coronary atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in AD patients </plain></SENT>
