<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>An autopsy study of cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in 310 Ghanaian adults 20 years and over, using a simplified grading system has shown a lower prevalence of severe lesions (necrotic, ulcerated, haemorrhagic and calcified lesions) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These severe lesions (Grade 3) were found in 11.0% hypertensives compared to 2.3% normotensives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This difference is statistically significant (p less than 0.005), thus confirming the observation of other workers that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> accelerates atherogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects dying of cerebral haemorrhage showed no significant increase in the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> of the cerebral vessels over hypertensives dying from other causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This would suggest that severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> is less involved in the pathogenesis of cerebral haemorrhage in the Ghanaians studied </plain></SENT>
