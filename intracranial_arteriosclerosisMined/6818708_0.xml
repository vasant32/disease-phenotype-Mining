<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Additionally, phospholipase-A2-induced aggregation was performed as a probe for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi> located at the platelet surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the assays were performed with washed platelets, eliminating a possible influence of plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Platelets from patients were found responsive to significantly lower concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi> whereas <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26995">thromboxane</z:chebi> and hydroxylated fatty acid biosynthesis did not differ from controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the experimental conditions used, 75% of the control platelets underwent aggregation with phospholipase A2 plus sphingomyelinase C, in comparison to only 50% for the patients, indicating the necessity for further analysis of the platelet membrane <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
