<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study investigates whether 51 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with CHD in multiple antecedent studies are associated with incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>Atherosclerosis</z:hpo> Risk in Communities (ARIC) study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>From the multiethnic ARIC cohort of 14,215 individuals, 495 validated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo> were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional hazards models, adjusted for age and gender, identified three SNPs in Whites and two SNPs in Blacks associated with incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (p &lt;or= 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The rs11628722 polymorphism in SERPINA9 was associated with incident <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in Whites and Blacks, even after taking into account traditional risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The idea that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and CHD may share some common genetic factors, such as variation in SERPINA9, should be investigated in other studies </plain></SENT>
