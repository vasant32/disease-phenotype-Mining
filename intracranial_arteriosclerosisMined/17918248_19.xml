<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Arterial stiffness is a newly recognized risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whether this is mediated by small- or large-artery disease is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined the relationship between arterial stiffness and <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vascular caliber </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A cross-sectional, population-based study of 5,731 participants (aged 45-84 years) who were free of clinical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> (the Multi-Ethnic Study of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>Atherosclerosis</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">Retinal</z:chebi> arteriolar and venular calibers were measured from <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> photographs according to standardized protocols </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Small- and large-artery compliance was determined from pulse contour analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After adjusting for age, sex, blood pressure, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, smoking, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> profile, and other risk factors, reduced large-artery compliance was associated with smaller <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> arteriolar caliber; each standard deviation decrease in large-artery compliance was associated with a 0.70 microm (p = 0.002) decrease in <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> arteriolar caliber </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for the same set of risk factors, reduced small-artery compliance was associated with wider <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> venular caliber; each standard deviation decrease in small artery compliance was associated with a 1.43 microm (p = 0.001) increase in <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> venular caliber </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These associations remained significant after further adjustments for large-vessel <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (carotid intima-media thickness, coronary artery calcium, and ankle-arm index) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: Reduced arterial wall compliance in large arterial beds is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0008043'>retinal arteriolar narrowing</z:hpo>, whereas reduced arterial wall compliance in small arterial beds is associated with <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> venular widening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data may provide further insights into the effects of altered arterial stiffness on the cerebral microcirculation </plain></SENT>
