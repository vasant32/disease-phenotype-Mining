<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Regular changes of those parameters were revealed, these changes depending on the disease gravity and time course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In graver forms and course of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> a diminution of the volume of the IIId blood-clotting fraction and a shortening of the time of its formation were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As the patients' state improved in the course of the conservative treatment given, the above parameters gradually approached those observed in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the contrary a deterioration of the patients' state led to a rapid diminution of the IIId fraction volume and shortening of the time of its formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The changes of the CBMDR parameters allow one to judge about the gravity of ischemic cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and the time course of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_596'>pathological process</z:mpath>, as well as to assess the efficacy of the therapy given </plain></SENT>
