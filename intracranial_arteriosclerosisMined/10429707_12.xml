<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To compare endovascular stent placement with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (<z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp>) of carotid arteries with respect to distal embolization and findings at intravascular ultrasonography (US), magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) imaging, and histopathologic analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> was performed in situ in one carotid artery, and stent placement was performed in the other, in ten cadavers (age range, 57-82 years; mean age, 68 years) with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> by using fluoroscopic and intravascular US guidance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The carotid artery was connected to a pressurized tubing system in which a pulsatile pump circulated water </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effluent water was collected during the interventions, and after filtration and staining, the embolic material was analyzed histologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After the interventions, the arteries were excised and 1.5-T spin-echo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No difference in severity of distal embolization during stent placement versus during <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The embolic particles were composed mainly of intimal strips and cellular constituents of the atherosclerotic plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging accurately depicted postinterventional changes, and the findings correlated closely with those of intravascular US and histopathologic analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although stent placement and <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> were associated with equal distal embolization, the smooth surface and fully patent arterial lumen depicted at intravascular US and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging postinterventionally may indicate that stent placement is preferable to <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
