<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Non-invasive imaging of <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> using 99mTc-<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> was shown to be feasible in animal models and patients but the clinical utility remains to be assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since recent reports suggest that oxidized <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> may play a major role in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, we developed a technique to oxidize autologous <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> and compared the biodistribution of oxidized-<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> with that of native-<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> in man </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, we evaluated the uptake in vivo of oxidized- and native-<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> by atherosclerotic plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>, obtained from human plasma was treated with various combinations of copper ions and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30492">H2O2</z:chebi> to induce oxidative modification by increasing the content of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation products and electrophoretic mobility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> (0.3 mg/ml) was incubated with 100 microM Cu2+ and 500 microM <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30492">H2O2</z:chebi> oxidation occurred rapidly within 1 h, and was labelled with 99mTc efficiently as native <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In vivo distribution studies revealed a faster plasma clearance of oxidized-<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> compared to native-<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>, and a higher uptake by the reticuloendothelial system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Tomographic scintigraphy of the neck in patients suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo>, revealed accumulation of radiolabelled <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> preparations in the carotid artery affected by <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We developed a technique to rapidly oxidize <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> using copper and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30492">H2O2</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Biodistribution data demonstrate that oxidized-<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> is rapidly cleared from circulation, is taken up mostly by organs rich in macrophages, and can be detected at the level of carotid plaques </plain></SENT>
