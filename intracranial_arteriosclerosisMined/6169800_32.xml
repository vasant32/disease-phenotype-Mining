<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were either <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischemic heart disease</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> disease, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> or accidents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty-two men with a mean age of 57 years (range 18-95 years) and 19 women with a mean age of 62 years (range 23-79 years) were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The influence of several factors were studied: brain weight, time between <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and autopsy, storage time before chemical analysis, age, sex, agonal status, cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, opiate treatment and time of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> during the day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most correlations between the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi> concentrations in different brain parts were positive, the strongest correlations in the basal ganglia and the limbic system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No consistent pattern of age-related <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi> changes were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The females had significantly higher 5-HIAA concentrations in the cortex of the gyrus hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Final <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> seemed to decrease <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi> concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Opiate treatment reduced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi> and increased 5-HIAA concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A marked circadian variation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi> was found, most pronounced in the hypothalamus, the limbic system and some neocortical areas </plain></SENT>
