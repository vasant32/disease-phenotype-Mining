<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To determine whether bypass surgery would benefit patients with symptomatic atherosclerotic disease of the internal carotid artery, we studied 1377 patients with recent hemisphere <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> infarction, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> who had atherosclerotic narrowing or occlusion of the ipsilateral internal carotid or middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of these, 714 were randomly assigned to the best medical care, and 663 to the same regimen with the addition of bypass surgery joining the superficial temporal artery and the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients were followed for an average of 55.8 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty-day surgical mortality and major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> morbidity rates were 0.6 and 2.5 per cent, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The postoperative bypass patency rate was 96 per cent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nonfatal and fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> occurred both more frequently and earlier in the patients operated on </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Secondary survival analyses comparing the two groups for major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, and for ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo> demonstrated a similar lack of benefit from surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Separate analyses in patients with different angiographic lesions did not identify a subgroup with any benefit from surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two important subgroups of patients fared substantially worse in the surgical group: those with severe middle-cerebral-<z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> (n = 109, Mantel-Haenszel chi-square = 4.74), and those with persistence of ischemic symptoms after an internal-carotid-<z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> had been demonstrated (n = 287, chi-square = 4.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study thus failed to confirm the hypothesis that extracranial-intracranial anastomosis is effective in preventing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in patients with atherosclerotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arterial disease</z:e> in the carotid and middle cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
