<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: To assess the prevalence of risk factors as determinants of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (IATH)-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in a multi-ethnic community-based cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The Northern Manhattan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Study included a population-based incidence study and a nested case-control study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Incident cases of first <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> were 1:2 when matched to community controls by age, sex, and race/ethnicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Vascular risk factors were assessed among controls and compared against the following <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes: IATH, extracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (EATH), and non-atherosclerotic (NATH: cardioembolic, lacunar, and cryptogenic) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Conditional logistic-regression was used to determine the association between risk factors and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The crude incidence of IATH was 8/100,000 per year and the relative incidence of IATH was higher than that of EATH in blacks (5.9 vs. 3.2/100,000 per year) and in Hispanics (5.0 vs. 1.7/100,000 per year) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The IATH group had a higher prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (DM; 67% IATH, 60% EATH, 48% NATH, and 23% controls; p &lt; 0.05 IATH vs. control) and of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> (62% IATH, 40% EATH, 40% NATH, and 35% controls; p &lt; 0.05 IATH vs. control) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, DM conferred a higher risk for IATH versus NATH <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (OR, 10.8; 95% CI, 2.0-57 vs. OR, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.9-3.9; p &lt; 0.05) and much lower for EATH (OR, 6.2; 95% CI, 1.2-32) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic syndrome</z:e> conferred a higher risk for IATH <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtype (OR, 4.6; 95% CI, 1.1-18.7) when compared to EATH (OR, 2.3; CI, 0.6-9.1) and NATH (OR, 2.4; CI, 1.7-3.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: DM is a more important determinant for IATH-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> than EATH or NATH </plain></SENT>
