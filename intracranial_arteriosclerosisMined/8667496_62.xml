<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Plaque rupture is often the precipitating event in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> coronary syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that a similar process occurs in stenotic carotid plaques in association with ischemic neurologic symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our purpose was to examine several morphologic features of stenotic carotid plaques and to determine which characteristics are more commonly associated with plaques obtained from patients with symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery disease</z:e> than with those from patients with asymptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-four carotid endarterectomy specimens (from 25 asymptomatic and 19 symptomatic patients) were analyzed with pentachrome staining and light microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The asymptomatic patients and symptomatic patients had similar mean percent stenosis (77% vs 74%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Other risk factors, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo>, smoking history, serum cholesterol, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels, were similar between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery disease</z:e> were found to have more frequent plaque rupture, fibrous cap thinning, and fibrous cap foam-cell infiltration when compared with the asymptomatic group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Plaque rupture was seen in 74% of symptomatic plaques and in only 32% of plaques from asymptomatic patients (p = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fibrous cap thinning was noted in 95% of symptomatic plaques and in 48% of asymptomatic plaques (p = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Infiltration of the fibrous cap with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003651'>foam cells</z:hpo> was also significantly more common in the symptomatic plaques (84% vs 44% of asymptomatic plaques; p = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, intraplaque fibrin was more common in symptomatic plaques than in asymptomatic (100% vs 68%; p = 0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were found between the two groups with respect to plaque <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, the presence of a necrotic core, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e>, smooth muscle cell infiltration, eccentric shape, and plaque type (fibrous, necrotic, or calcified) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: As in the coronary artery system, rupture of the atherosclerotic plaque may play an important role in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> caused by carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The process of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, involving foam-cell infiltration of the fibrous cap, may contribute to rupture of the atherosclerotic plaque </plain></SENT>
