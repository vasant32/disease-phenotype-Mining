<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> that predicted subsequent hyalinization of renal arterioles at autopsy were identified, using data from the Honolulu Heart Program, a prospective epidemiological study of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>) in Japanese-American men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among 8006 participants at baseline, 1381 died between 1965 and 1982; 285 of these had a protocol autopsy, and 150 had assessments of arteriolar hyalinization from renal tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects were categorized into four groups on the basis of the number of hyalinized arterioles per square centimeter of renal tissue, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> risk factor levels and proportions were compared across these groups with the use of general linear models and logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multivariate assessment using logistic regression demonstrated that diastolic blood pressure (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi>) and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level were positively associated and alcohol intake was negatively associated with an elevated degree of renal arteriolar hyalinization, independent of other <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The odds ratios for elevated hyalinization associated with a 10-mm Hg increase in <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi>, a 20-mg/dL increase in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level, and a 30-mL/d increase in alcohol intake were 1.97 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.24-3.12), 1.23 (95% CI = 1.07-1.41), and 0.24 (95% CI = 0.11-0.55), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Associations were similar when prevalent cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> were excluded and when autopsy selection bias was taken into account </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Renal arteriolar hyalinization was also more strongly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in the larger cerebral vessels (Spearman's r = .59, P &lt; .001) than in the coronary arteries (r = .16, P = .073) and aorta (r = .24, P = .022) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Hyalinization was significantly related to cardiovascular-renal mortality, and this association was accounted for by other <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that blood pressure, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level, and alcohol intake are independent predictors of hyalinization in renal arterioles and that this type of renal vasculopathy may be a marker for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in other vascular regions, particularly the cerebral vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The protective association involving alcohol and the possibility that renal arteriolar hyalinization may be an indicator of cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> may warrant investigation in other populations </plain></SENT>
