<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To determine the prevalence and correlates of symptomatic peripheral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in individuals with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (MI) and cholesterol levels lower than 240 mg/dL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis was conducted at baseline of 4159 participants in the Cholesterol and Recurrent Events (CARE) Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> was defined as a history of MI plus lower extremity or cerebrovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1456822" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">claudication</z:e> by Rose questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The prevalence of symptomatic diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> was 12.9%; 353 participants (8.5%) had lower extremity disease and 219 (5.3%) had cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After controlling for other variables, diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> was associated with age (Odds Ratio [OR] = 1.44 per ten-year increase), systolic blood pressure (OR = 1.13 per 10 mm Hg increase), a history of multiple <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarctions</z:hpo> (OR = 1.76), <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (OR = 1.76), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (OR = 1.38), reduced exercise performance (OR = 1.55), current smoking status (OR = 2.87), and lower alcohol intake (OR = 0.97 per drink per week) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no association with race, gender, or <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The presence of clinically evident diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> is common and is associated with several modifiable risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Early identification of these individuals could affect treatment and clinical outcomes </plain></SENT>
