<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: An effort has been made to distinguish the composition of carotid atherosclerotic plaques (CAP) from patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy, by laser induced fluorescence spectroscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS: Different excitation wavelengths were used: 476, 488, and 458 nm of a continuous wave <z:chebi fb="25" ids="49696">krypton</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">argon</z:chebi> ion laser, and 337 nm of a pulsed nitrogen laser </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three CAP samples from different patients were investigated and several spectra from each plaque were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Results were crossed-examined with conventional histologic techniques, which showed three areas of different composition on the pathologic samples: fibrous tissue, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> constituents, and calcified plaque </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Gaussian fittings were performed to reproduce the fluorescence spectra as a correlation of multiple Gaussian curves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The accuracy for discrimination of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> composition of the atherosclerotic plaque is still limited, due to superposition of the fluorescence emission of various plaque components </plain></SENT>
