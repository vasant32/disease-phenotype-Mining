<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively studied the parameters obtained from 180 patients without significant cervical carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The peak systolic velocity (PSV), end diastolic velocity (EDV), pulsatility index (PI) and diameter of the cervical internal carotid artery, and intima media thickness (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>) of the common carotid artery were obtained bilaterally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These parameters were evaluated according to the side and the patient's sex, age, and cerebral ischemic symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No significant effects of the side or sex were observed on any parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Aging affected the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> and PI positively and the EDV negatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The PI correlated positively with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the symptomatic group the PSV and EDV decreased; this was still observed after adjustments for age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results confirm the effects of aging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>PI seems to be another indicator of cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, because it correlates well with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IMT</z:e>, a well-recognized indicator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Cerebral ischemic symptoms may be affected by reduced velocity more than by atherosclerotic progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This phenomenon requires further evaluation </plain></SENT>
