<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 200 consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, the inter-rater reliability and proportion of subtypes of the new classification system were assessed and compared with those of the Trial of ORG 10172 in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Treatment (TOAST) classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The most frequent subtype of the new classification was atherothrombosis (n = 80, 40%), followed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> of undetermined etiology (n = 54, 27%), small artery disease (n = 33, 16.5%), cardioembolism (n = 26, 13%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> of other determined etiology (n = 7, 3.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three raters agreed to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtype diagnosis in 165 out of 200 cases and the overall kappa value was excellent (kappa = 0.82) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The new classification system for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> was easy to use and had high inter-rater reliability </plain></SENT>
