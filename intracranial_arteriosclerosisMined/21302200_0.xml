<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Until recently, the treatment of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> has remained limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Due to advances in endovascular technology and technique, angioplasty and stenting has become an accepted treatment for medically-refractory intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> frequently have multiple lesions, however, the clinical significance of each individual lesion is not always evident </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In these instances the treating physician must decide which lesions should be managed conservatively, and which should be treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>TECHNIQUE: Emphasizing decision-making, we describe a patient in whom 3 separate <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> in the same vascular territory underwent endovascular treatment in one treatment session </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Each of the lesions was treated with angioplasty and stent placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This may be a relatively safe and efficacious technique that allows for the treatment of multiple lesions without the risks associated with multiple cerebral angiograms </plain></SENT>
