<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Our purpose was to study the association between the intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> as measured by cavernous carotid artery calcification (ICAC) observed on head CT and atrophic changes of supra-tentorial brain demonstrated by MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Institutional review board approval was obtained for this retrospective study incorporating 65 consecutive patients presenting acutely who had both head CT and MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003207'>Arterial calcifications</z:hpo> of the intracranial cavernous carotids (ICAC) were assigned a number (1 to 4) in the bone window images from CT scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These 4 groups were then combined into high (grades 3 and 4) and low calcium (grades 1 and 2) subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Brain MRI was independently evaluated to identify cortical and central <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Demographics and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> were evaluated in subjects with high and low ICAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Relationship between CT demonstrated ICAC and brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> patterns were evaluated both without and with adjustment for cerebral ischemic scores and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiovascular risk factors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-six of the 65 (71%) patients had high ICAC on head CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Subjects with high ICAC were older, and had higher prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (CAD), <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> and history of previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="46274">CVA</z:chebi>) compared to those with low ICAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Age demonstrated strong correlation with both supratentorial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between ICAC and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002120'>cortical atrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was correlation however between central <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> and ICAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This persisted even after adjustment for age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Age is the most important determinant of atrophic cerebral changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>However, high ICAC demonstrated age independent association with central <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
