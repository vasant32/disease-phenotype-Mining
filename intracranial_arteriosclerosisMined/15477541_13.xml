<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Achievement rates for the eight program goals at time of discharge were compared in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients discharged from a university hospital-based <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> service with a diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> during a 1-year period after implementation of the PROTECT Program vs rates obtained from a comparable group of patients admitted to the same service during the preceding year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Demographic and medical features were comparable in the baseline and intervention cohorts for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> presumed due to large-vessel <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> or small-vessel disease (baseline year n = 117, intervention n = 130) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Implementation rates in patients without specific contraindications increased for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four medication goals: 97 to 100% for antithrombotic agents, 68 to 97% for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi>, 42 to 90% for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35457">angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors</z:chebi>/angiotensin receptor blockers, and 14 to 70% for <z:chebi fb="40" ids="35498">diuretics</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although data were not collected on baseline lifestyle instruction rates, instruction in the program's four lifestyle interventions was achieved by discharge in 100% of the intervention cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Implementation of this single-center, systems-based, in-hospital program to initiate secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> prevention therapies was associated with a substantial increase in treatment utilization at the time of hospital discharge </plain></SENT>
