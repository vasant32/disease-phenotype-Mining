<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus, many potential variables including ocular disease, vessel wall properties, intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and collateral flow may affect the results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although oculoplethysmography was quite accurate in detecting occlusion of the internal carotid artery, the identification of a high grade stenosis was much less precise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, it could not distinguish between stenosis and occlusion, making angiography necessary for accurate diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study, oculoplethysmography, either alone or in combination with carotid phonoangiography, was not of sufficient accuracy to recommend its use as part of a noninvasive evaluation of carotid artery occlusive disease </plain></SENT>
