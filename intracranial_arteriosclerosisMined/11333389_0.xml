<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: The estimated prevalence of basilar dolichoectasia in the healthy general population is 50 per 100,000 inhabitants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The treatment of symptomatic cases is controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Strokes</z:hpo> caused by it may be due to <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the perforating arteries, arterio-arterial emboli or a compressive mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL CASE: We present the case of a 68 year old woman with repeated stokes in which the vertebrobasilar territory was involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On neuroimaging there was basilar dolichoectasia associated with aneurismal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of both internal carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patient died of massive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> after starting <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At necropsy the aneurysmic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> was confirmed together with signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> of the arteries of the circle of Willis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Since <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> secondary to rupture of a dolichoectasia is exceptional, some authors support the use of permanent anticoagulation rather than platelet antiaggregation in patients with conditions due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, in which <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> is limited to the basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, this is not suitable for cases with associated fusiform aneuryms, or cases such as ours in which the dolichoectasia extends beyond the basilar artery, to become generalized throughout <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the arteries of the circle of Willis </plain></SENT>
