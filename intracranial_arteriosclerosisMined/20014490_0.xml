<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: By polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism, polymorphism of SG13S114A/T in ALOX5AP gene in 412 cases with ACI and 368 non-ACI controls were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULT: There were no statistically significant differences in the ALOX5AP gene SG13S114 AA genotype and A allele frequencies between ACI group and control group (P&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results do not support genotype SG13S114 A allele as the risk gene for ACI.control group </plain></SENT>
