<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Causes of pontine haemorrhages which have an incidence of 2 to 4/100 000/year include <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, vascular malformations (a.v.-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018916" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">haemangioma</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001048'>cavernous haemangioma</z:hpo>, capillary teleangiectasies), anticoagulative treatment and inflammatory <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diffusely spreading hypertensive haemorrhages are of apo-plectiform <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> with fast developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo>, and show disturbance of vegetative function (disturbance of respiration, cardiac dysrhythmias, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>hyperthermia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000616'>miosis</z:hpo> and other neuroophthalmologic symptoms, flaccid tetraparalysis and blood-stained cerebrospinal fluid; mortality is high, reaching 50% after 24 hours and 90% after 3 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Vascular malformations are the origin of circumscribed pontine haematomas with slowly progressing disturbance of consciousness and brain stem symptoms with variable course exhibiting multiple remissions and recurrences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In respect of symptomatology and clinical course, slight lateral hypertensive pontine haemorrhages must be placed between these two typical syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis of pontine haemorrhages is supported by x-ray computed tomography, but vascular malformations can be detected only by cerebral angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treatment of patients with pontine haemorrhages must be based on intensive care with regular control via CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002516'>Increased intracranial pressure</z:hpo> and internal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> caused by blockage of CSF passage necessitate ventricular drainage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>While hypertensive pontine haemorrhages cannot be surgically treated, pontine haematomas and the causative vascular malformations can be removed </plain></SENT>
