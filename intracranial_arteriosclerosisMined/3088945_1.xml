<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The median exposure-area product was 3198 R cm2 (range, 616-5665 R cm2) in the conventional angiography group and 1831 R cm2 (range, 366-4198 R cm2) in the IV digital subtraction angiography (DSA) group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This difference in exposure resulted from increased use of fluoroscopy in the conventional screen-film angiography group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The actual difference in exposure between the radiographic and digital imaging portions of the examinations was much smaller </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The contributions of fluoroscopy to the radiation exposure in conventional angiography and IV-DSA in this study were 37% (range, 8.8-76%) and 6% (range, 1.5-25%), respectively </plain></SENT>
