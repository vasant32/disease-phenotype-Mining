<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> during carotid surgery is in the neighborhood of 1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With Doppler and ultrasonic imaging, it is now possible to recognize <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> in 11% of these cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Depending on the extent of the clinical manifestations caused by one or the other of these lesions, there are several therapeutic options: surgery of the carotid with special protection of the myocardium during and after surgery or simultaneous carotid and coronary surgery in high risk cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Between 1979 and 1986, simultaneous surgery was performed in 18 cases in our department </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During the same period, 1194 carotid endarterectomies and 505 coronary bypasses were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These 18 cases included 13 males and 5 females with a mean age of 62 years (range: 43 to 78 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The procedure performed in these cases were 17 carotid endarterectomies, one bypass of the innominate artery and an average of 2 aorto-coronary bypasses per patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> occurred in the immediate postoperative period and another patient died suddenly 8 months later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The evolution of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arterial disease</z:e> was evaluated in the other patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Simultaneous carotid and coronary artery surgery is indicated in high risk carotid and coronary patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Perusal of the results in the literature allows a better appreciation of the indications and risks of this type of surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our series indicates the necessity for a careful preoperative workup in these patients and the need for more accurate screening to obtain better results </plain></SENT>
