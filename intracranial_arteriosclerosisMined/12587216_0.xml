<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These are discussed as a function of vascular risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the first series (12 cases), there was no correlation between the severity of small vessel lesions: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_40'>hyalinosis</z:mpath> (12/12), <z:mpath ids='MPATH_555'>mineralisation</z:mpath> (10/12), amyloid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">angiopathy</z:e> (9/12), vascular risk factors (<z:mp ids='MP_0002842'>high blood pressure</z:mp> or <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>), Alzheimer's lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, there was a tendency for an association between amyloid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">angiopathy</z:e> and high density of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002185'>neurofibrillary tangles</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the second series (20 cases), small <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and lacunes were found in 9/20 cases, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002185'>neurofibrillary tangles</z:hpo> and diffuse deposits of A beta <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> were constant, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100256'>senile plaques</z:hpo> were very frequent (19/20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five patients were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860630" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">demented</z:e> (one vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, one Alzheimer <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo>, and 3 mixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementias</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that: 1) Lesions of the walls of small cerebral vessels do not seem linked to the vascular risk factors observed at the end of the life of centenarians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>2) Cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and lacunes are frequent in these patients, and are responsible, at least in part, for a high proportion of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive dysfunctions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The study of larger series is needed for a better understanding of relationships between vascular and degenerative lesions in the oldest old </plain></SENT>
