<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have suggested a role for Chlamydia pneumoniae in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the presence of this pathogen in atherosclerotic middle cerebral arteries has heretofore not been documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we analyzed atheromatous plaques from middle cerebral arteries for the presence of C pneumoniae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Atherosclerotic middle cerebral arteries from 15 cadavers who died of natural causes and corresponding nonatherosclerotic arteries from 4 otherwise healthy trauma victims were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Assays for C pneumoniae DNA were carried out by nested polymerase chain reaction (nPCR) specific for the C pneumoniae ompA gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The presence of the bacterium was assessed by transmission electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Five of the 15 atherosclerotic arterial samples and none of the control tissues were positive for C pneumoniae by nPCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Particles similar in <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and size to C pneumoniae elementary bodies were detected by transmission electron microscopy in 4 of the 5 nPCR-positive atherosclerotic samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The demonstration of C pneumoniae in atherosclerotic middle cerebral arteries is consistent with the hypothesis that this bacterium is involved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> cerebrovascular diseases </plain></SENT>
