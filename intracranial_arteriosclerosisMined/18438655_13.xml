<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: We report our first clinical experience with a CE-marked flexible monorail balloon-expandable stent for treatment of high-grade intracranial stenoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between April 2006 and November 2007 21 patients with symptomatic intracranial stenoses (&gt;70%) were treated with the PHAROS stent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In seven patients, the procedure was performed during <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Procedural success, clinical complication rates and mid-term follow-up data were prospectively recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During a median follow-up period of 7.3 months one additional patient died of an unknown cause 3 months after the intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A patient with a significant residual stenosis presented with a new <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> after further progression of the residual stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>None of the successfully treated patients experienced ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Recanalization of intracranial stenoses with the balloon-expandable Pharos stent is technically feasible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The periprocedural complication rate and mid-term follow-up results were in the range of previously reported case series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This pilot study was limited by the small sample size and severe morbidity of the included patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Final evaluation of the efficacy of Pharos stent treatment demands further investigation </plain></SENT>
