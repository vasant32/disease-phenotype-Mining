<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE To investigate the relationship between the Nco I, Ava II polymorphism of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low density lipoprotein</z:chebi> receptor (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>-R) gene in patients with the occurrence of atherosclerotic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> (ACI) among the Han nationality in Liaoning province </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS The polymerase chain reaction technique was used to study the polymorphisms of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>-R gene and allele frequencies in 77 patients with ACI and in 113 age-matched Chinese healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The levels of the <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="6495">lipoproteins</z:chebi> were also compared among the cases with ACI and the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS A(+) frequencies of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>-R gene in healthy controls and ACI group were 0.230 and 0.125 respectively, while the N(+) frequencies of healthy control and ACI group was 0.667 and 0.662 respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In case of the coexistence of A(-) A(-) and N(+) N(+), the relative risk (RR) of ACI was 5.56(P&lt;0.001), while the RR of the increase of serum levels TG, TC, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47774">LDL-C</z:chebi>, LP(a) were 4.29, 7.67, 9.33 and 3.09(P&lt;0.05), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION The coexistence of A(-) A(-) and N(+) N(+) can affect the concentration of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> and is in close relationship with the occurrence of ACI </plain></SENT>
