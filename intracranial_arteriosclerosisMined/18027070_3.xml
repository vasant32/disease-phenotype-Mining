<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the association of Apo E4 and ACE Ins/Del genotypes with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk and changes in serum <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> in 228 consecutive Tunisian <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients, and 323 age-and gender-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Comparable frequencies of ACE Ins/Del alleles were seen between patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of Apo epsilon3 allele and Apo E3/E3 were lower (P &lt; 0.001), while the frequency of Apo epsilon4 allele and epsilon4-containing genotypes (E3/E4 and E4/E4) were elevated (P &lt; 0.001) among patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Higher proportion of Apo E4-carrying + ACE Del/Del positive cases were seen in young (&lt;50 years) patients (P = 0.012), and was associated with large vessel <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (P = 0.035) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean serum cholesterol, <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> were comparable between E4-containing and no E4-containing and ACE Del/Del-positive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Apo E4 and ACE Del/Del genotype combination substantially increase <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk, supporting the notion that interactions of multiple gene variants influence <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
