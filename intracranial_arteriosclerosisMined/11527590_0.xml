<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A new method of grading ultrasound (US) images to assess plaque composition is described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>B-mode US images were obtained from 50 carotid specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Image analysis parameters were entered into a discriminant analysis package and compared retrospectively with histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Discriminant functions were derived and then applied prospectively to image-analysis data obtained from a further 50 plaque specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For the prospective analysis, US images were graded according to the relative contribution of calcium, fibrous tissue, haemorrhage and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The accuracy for retrospective classification of calcium was 100%, for fibrous tissue 97%, for <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> 76% and 68% for haemorrhage (kappa = 0.81) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Prospective classification showed an overall agreement of 65% (kappa = 0.47) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Significant intraplaque haemorrhage was identified with an 81% sensitivity and 83% specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The US method described demonstrated improved accuracy compared to previous studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further study is required to establish the use of this method for in vivo images and its correlation with patient symptoms </plain></SENT>
