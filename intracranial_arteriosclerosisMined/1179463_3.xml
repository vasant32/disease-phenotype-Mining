<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These studies were performed in light of the possible importance of these <z:chebi fb="0" ids="13850">apoproteins</z:chebi> in both <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> metabolism and the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>ApoA-I from <z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">high density lipoproteins</z:chebi>, apoB from <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low density lipoproteins</z:chebi>, and apoC-III from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39027">very low density lipoproteins</z:chebi> were localized also as markers for their respective <z:chebi fb="2" ids="6495">lipoproteins</z:chebi>, since the latter cross-react immunologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The three <z:chebi fb="0" ids="13850">apoproteins</z:chebi> were localized to the same regions of lesions as neutral <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> and, to some extent, fibrinogen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These regions consisted of bands of collagen fibers, usually deeper within the lesion, and the <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> core or atheroma of such advanced lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although the superposition of localization for the three <z:chebi fb="0" ids="13850">apoproteins</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> was only 53%, it was suggested that deviation from complete superposition was due to the abrupt changes in lesion structure resulting from the focal nature of the atherosclerotic process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that there is a broader specificity than previously implied of the interaction between such lesion components as connective tissue and extracellular <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> accumulations, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="13850">apoproteins</z:chebi> from plasma <z:chebi fb="2" ids="6495">lipoproteins</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This interaction is believed to result in a net retention within <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> of human extracranial arteries of these plasma-derived factors, either as free <z:chebi fb="0" ids="13850">apoproteins</z:chebi> or as native <z:chebi fb="2" ids="6495">lipoproteins</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
