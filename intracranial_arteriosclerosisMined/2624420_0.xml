<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Sixty-four patients with suspected atherosclerotic cervical and intracranial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> were examined by intra-arterial digital subtraction angiography (IA-DSA), following placement of a catheter in the aortic arch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The commonest abnormality demonstrated was the presence of an atherosclerotic plaque, most commonly on the posterior wall of the proximal internal carotid at its origin in the neck </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The quality of the images obtained were assessed and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, the carotid arteries in the neck could be adequately visualised if both oblique views of the neck were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The intracranial arteries and the anterior and middle cerebral arteries were also adequately visualised in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients although the basilar-posterior cerebral arteries were poorly seen in 8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DSA examinations of the carotid and intracerebral vessels can also be performed by the intravenous route (IV-DSA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However IV-DSA is associated with significant limitations which include inadequate visualisation of intracranial circulation, larger volume of contrast medium required and higher risk of contrast reactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>IA-DSA gives adequate visualisation of the aortic arch, cervical vessels and intracranial circulation in most patients without selective catheterisation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Examination time is shorter, procedure is safe and film costs are reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Disadvantages include small field size and inferior spatial resolution compared to conventional angiography but in no patients was there a need to resort to conventional angiography </plain></SENT>
