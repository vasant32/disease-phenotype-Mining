<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: A retrospective analysis of a 9-year experience with balloon angioplasty for intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis was undertaken with the goals of illustrating development of a safe technique for treatment of intracranial atherosclerotic disease and reporting the immediate results in this series of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Three distinct periods are defined, based on the technique used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the early period, in which eight patients were treated, the angioplasty balloon size approximated the vessel size, but was always smaller </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Angioplasty was moderately rapid and brief (15-30 seconds) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical improvement occurred in seven (87.5%) of eight patients, dissection without consequence occurred in four (50%) of eight, and residual stenosis greater than 50% was found in three (37.5%) of eight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No neurological complications occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the middle period, in which 12 patients were treated, the balloon size approximated the vessel size, but oversizing by up to 0.25 mm was permitted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Angioplasty was extremely rapid and brief </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Angiographically visible dissection occurred in nine (75%) of 12 patients, necessitating urokinase infusion in five (41.7%) of 12 and producing abrupt occlusion in one (8.3%) of 12, resulting in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Occlusion secondary to the recrossing of the lesion occurred in one (8.3%) of 12, resulting in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Good outcome was eventually achieved in 10 (83.3%) of 12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the current period, in which 50 patients have been treated, the balloon is always undersized and inflation is extremely slow (several minutes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Dissection occurred in seven (14%) of 50 patients, necessitating fibrinolysis in two of 50 (4%, both uneventful) and producing no abrupt occlusion or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Residual stenosis greater than 50% occurred in eight (16%) of 50, with no stenosis greater than 70% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Late restenosis occurred in four (9%) of 44 and successful repeated angioplasty was performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>One guidewire vessel <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> occurred (2%), resulting in the patient's <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Good angiographic and short-term clinical outcome was achieved in the other 49 patients (98%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Extremely slow balloon inflation combined with balloon undersizing results in decreased intimal damage, decreased <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> platelet/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> deposition, and decreased <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> closure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>This technique sometimes yields suboptimal angiographic results but achieves the clinical goal safely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Intracranial angioplasty can be safely performed using this technique and modern equipment </plain></SENT>
