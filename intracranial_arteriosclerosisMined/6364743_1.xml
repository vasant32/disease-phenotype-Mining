<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ninety percent of the vertebral images were of diagnostic quality; 23% of the basilar images were good quality and 53% fair quality; and 58% of the posterior cerebral images were poor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Compared with selective film arteriography in 23 patients, DSA tended to underestimate the degree of atheromatous disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Segments of the basilar artery were often poorly seen, which could result in false-negative errors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DSA can provide a general assessment of atheromatous disease of the brachiocephalic vessels, including the vertebral and carotid arteries, and in many cases can exclude occlusion or critical stenosis of the vertebrobasilar system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, it does not adequately image the posterior cerebral or cerebellar artery </plain></SENT>
