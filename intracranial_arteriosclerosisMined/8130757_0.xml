<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The object of the study was also to find out whether these two components represent a macromolecular complex with increased atherogenic capacity or only two risk factors acting separately but achieving a summation of their atherogenic power </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It can be considered that in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> the presence of the two risk factors constitutes a condition of acceleration of the atherogenic process, i.e., the appearance of the vascular accident </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The decrease of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="47775">HDL-cholesterol</z:chebi> detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the subgroups studied is probably due to the decrease of the cholesterol "reverse transport" process which favours the atherogenic process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It was found that CIC and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="39026">low density lipoproteins</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi>) are risk factors which act separately determining by the effects they generate a summation of their atherogenic capacity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cholesterol and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> apparently contained in the CIC structure, can be considered as a methodologic artefact due to the use of a common reagent (<z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi>-6000) </plain></SENT>
