<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of the 805 carotid reconstructions performed between January 1984 and December 1992, a total of 357 were for asymptomatic atherosclerotic stenosis in 312 patients (227 men, 85 women) with a mean age of 69.6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Group I included 141 patients (161 procedures) who presented no neurologic manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Group II included 49 patients (55 procedures) who underwent carotid reconstruction before or at the same time as another cardiovascular procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Group III included 122 patients (141 procedures) who presented nonhemispheric manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients in group III had a significantly higher number of obstructive lesions in brain arteries (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Seven patients died within the first 30 postoperative days, including three who underwent combined single-stage procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nine patients presented nonfatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, including three who progressively recovered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The cumulative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate (CDSR) was 5.12% overall, 3.54% in group I, 12.24% in group II, and 4.09% in group III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The difference between groups I and II was statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Taking into account only <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> related to carotid surgery and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> with permanent disability, the CDSR was 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>83% in group I and 3.25% in group III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Follow-up ranged from 24 to 132 months (mean: 66.2) with a total of 11 patients being lost from follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Actuarial 5-year survival was 81.99 +/- 7.13% in group I, 70.65 +/- 13.72% in group II, and 68.51 +/- 8.93% in group III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Differences between group I and both groups II (p &lt; 0.01) and III (p &lt; 0.05) were statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Overall 5-year patency was 95.59 +/- 2.28% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> occurred during follow-up in 13 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The probability of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-free survival was 95.29 +/- 3.76% in group I, 91.03 +/- 8.52% in group II, and 89.09 +/- 6.39% in group III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The difference between groups I and III was statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Patients with asymptomatic carotid lesions can be divided into different prognostic groups </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Long-term <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk is higher in patients with nonhemispheric neurological manifestations </plain></SENT>
