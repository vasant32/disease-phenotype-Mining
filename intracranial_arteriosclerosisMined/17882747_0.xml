<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The majority of middle <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral artery aneurysms</z:hpo> are treated by microsurgical clipping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Most of the classifications of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> at present are based on size, location or pathology which are effective for the description but are less useful in preoperative planning and also in deciding on the technique or type of clip application </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to examine the morphological features of unruptured <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> bifurcation <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> which influence the techniques of clipping of these <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> and to attempt to subclassify unruptured middle <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral artery aneurysms</z:hpo> based on their preoperative 3D CTA and intraoperative characteristics so as to help in the intraoperative choice of technique and clip application, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Preoperative 3D CT angiography and intraoperative images along with the record of technique and type of clips used for 141 unruptured <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> operated at our center were studied retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Unruptured <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> bifurcation <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> could be subclassified into 5 types based on the similarities in their morphological features which influenced the techniques of clipping as recorded from their preoperative 3D CTA and intraoperative view </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These types and the distinctive feature of each type are described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The various techniques of clipping are discussed based on these subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The groups outlined make possible the establishment of a common technical approach to clipping within the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This classification, based on preoperative 3D CTA and intraoperative morphological features of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and parent vessels, helps in the intraoperative choice of technique and type of clip application to tackle these lesions </plain></SENT>
