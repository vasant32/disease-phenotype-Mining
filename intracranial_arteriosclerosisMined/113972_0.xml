<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic attacks</z:e> observed were found to be due to irritation of the frontal adversive and pre-moter fields </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Focal clonic <z:mp ids='MP_0000947'>convulsions</z:mp> in the foot due to irritation of the brain paracentral lobule were also observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The versatility of the clinical forms of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic attacks</z:e> was determined mainly by the involvement of particular cytoarchitectonic fields of the frontal lobe of the brain (8th, 6th, 4th) belonging to the zone of mixed blood supply by the frontal and median cerebral arteries and provided with blood by different cortical branches of those arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinico-angiographic and clinico-morphological comparisons showed that in most patients with focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic attacks</z:e> there was combined involvement of the internal carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
