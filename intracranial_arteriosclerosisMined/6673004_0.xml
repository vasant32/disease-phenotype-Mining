<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After a short historical note on phlebotomy, the precursor therapy to hemodilution, the hemorheological theory proposed to explain the effects of hemodilution in the treatment of obliterative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular diseases</z:e>, is outlined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is stressed that this procedure is not intended to reduce the 'viscosity' of blood in the conventional sense, but to counteract or abolish the thixotropic and pseudoplastic properties of human blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These exist only at low shear stresses and only at <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or elevated hematocrit levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thence, hemodilution is induced to ensure maintenance of residual blood flow even if the shear stresses fall below subcritical levels in the poststenotic areas of the vascular beds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compensatory mechanisms for the induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, the effect of hemodilution on oxygen delivery to various organs is reviewed, and a short summary of the presently available clinical experience is given </plain></SENT>
