<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: An arteriosclerotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> in the perforating artery has been focused on as a causative factor for hypertensive intracerebral haemorrhage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, its pathogenesis remains unknown, and its existence is still a controversy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE DESCRIPTION: A 62-year-old female and a 70-year-old male with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> suffered from intracerebral haemorrhage accompanied by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cerebral angiograms demonstrated an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> arising from the perforating artery at the central location of the haematoma in both cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were confirmed as the cause of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> during microsurgery, and were resected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Histological examination of the surgical specimens revealed that the walls of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> lacked internal elastic lamina and consisted only of the adventitia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These findings demonstrate that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> in the perforating artery can be a causative factor for hypertensive intracerebral haemorrhage, and indicate that the loss of internal elastic lamina induced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> may contribute to the formation of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the perforating artery </plain></SENT>
