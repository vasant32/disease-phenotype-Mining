<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The causes and mechanisms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> are still largely unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serum levels of a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi>, Lp(a), have been shown, in retrospective and some prospective clinical studies, to be associated with increased risk of myocardial and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The active part of Lp(a), apo(a), has &gt; 80% homology with plasminogen; thus it may competitively inhibit the thrombolytic action of plasminogen and enhance thrombogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lp(a) has been shown to be deposited in the vascular wall of the aorta and coronary vessels, but its presence in the cerebral vessels has not yet been shown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Autopsy specimens of vessels of the circle of Willis from 23 patients were examined for degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and deposition of apo(a) by immunohistochemistry with apo(a)-specific monoclonal antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The amount of apo(a) deposition in cerebral vessels correlated well with the degree of cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Arterial deposition of apo(a) was found entirely within the endothelial cell and subendothelial cell layers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no staining within the media and adventitia, with the exception of staining within the endothelial cells of the vasa vasorum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Correlation between the <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of apo(a) deposition and plaque stage was found suggesting that detection of apo(a) in endothelial cells is an early event in the development of the atherosclerotic plaque of cerebral vessels </plain></SENT>
