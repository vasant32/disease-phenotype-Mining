<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eighty-nine patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo> were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) was used to evaluate potential sources of embolisms in the aortic arch and in the heart; duplex ultrasound was used for the carotid artery; and intracranial Doppler (TCD) imaging was used for the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>), anterior cerebral artery (ACA), posterior cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>), and basilar artery (BA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An atherosclerotic lesion in the aortic arch was defined as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (0); mild plaque (1); moderate plaque (2); and protruding plaque or mobile plaque (3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A lesion in the carotid artery was considered a plaque if the maximal carotid plaque thickness was 1.2 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>TCD results were deemed abnormal if flow velocity was either greater or lower than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, and, in the case of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>, if an asymmetry index above 21% was measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 89 patients, 52 (58.43%) patients showed evidence of aortic arch <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (AAA), including 11 (12.36%) patients graded mild, 18 (20.22%) patients graded moderate, and 23 (25.84%) patients graded severe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the 23 patients with severe AAA, AAA was determined to be an important potential embolic source in 14 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Forty-nine (50.56%) patients had carotid arterial plaques (CAPs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The incidence of carotid plaques was higher among patients with AAA than among patients without AAA (71.15% vs 21.62%, OR = 3.291, 95% CI = 1.740 - 6.225, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>TCD abnormalities affecting the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> were found in 54 (60.67%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Differences in incidence of TCD abnormalities between patients with AAA and without AAA (69.23% vs 48.65%) were not significant (OR = 1.423, 95% CI = 0.976 - 2.076, P = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was a higher incidence of AAA in older, male patients with a history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and smoking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: AAA is an important potential source of cerebral embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The presence of carotid arterial plaques correlates with AAA incidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Most of carotid artery lesion were plaques other than severe stenosis, it may be the character of carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>It appears that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> does not mainly occur in the intracranial arteries in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients as thought before </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Aged, male, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and smoking are important risk factors to the AAA </plain></SENT>
