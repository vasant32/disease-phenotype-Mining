<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two patients had been hypertensive and 8 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo> before the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of cerebral artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The histological characteristics of the thrombosed arterial segments were intramural <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> in 28 segments, superficial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> of the fibrous cap of the atheroma of fibrous plaque in 4, rupture of the atheromatous plaque in 1, superficial accumulation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003651'>foam cells</z:hpo> in the atheroma in 1 and an atheroma or fibrous plaque without any other changes in 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They were many intramural small blood vessels in the atheroma or fibrous plaques of 22 segments with intramural <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fibrinoid degeneration of these small blood vessels was noted in 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings suggested that intramural <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> from the intramural small blood vessels was the major cause of cerebral artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and that persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> not only promoted cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> but also induced <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> from the intramural small blood vessels </plain></SENT>
