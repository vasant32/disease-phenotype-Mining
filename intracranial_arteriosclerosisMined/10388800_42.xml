<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although a number of studies compared single patient groups with controls, there are only a few studies comparing gait parameters between patients with different <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112108" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological disorders</z:e> affecting gait </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, gait parameters were compared between control subjects, patients with parkinsonian gait due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">idiopathic Parkinson's disease</z:e>, subjects suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>cerebellar ataxia</z:hpo> and patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001288'>gait disturbance</z:hpo> due to subcortical arteriosclerotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition to recording of baseline parameters during preferred walking velocity, subjects were required to vary velocity from very slow to very fast </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Values of velocity and stride length from each subject were then used for linear regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Whereas <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patient groups showed slower walking velocity and reduced step length compared with healthy controls when assessed during preferred walking, patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> and subcortical arteriosclerotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> had, in addition, increased variability of amplitude and timing of steps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Regression analysis showed that with changing velocity, subjects with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">Parkinson's disease</z:e> changed their stride length in the same proportion as that measured in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> and subcortical arteriosclerotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> had a disproportionate contribution of stride length when velocity was increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Whereas the findings in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">Parkinson's disease</z:e> can be explained as a reduction of force gain, the observations for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> and subcortical arteriosclerotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> reflect an altered spatiotemporal gait strategy in order to compensate for instability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The similarity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001288'>gait disturbance</z:hpo> in subcortical arteriosclerotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>cerebellar ataxia</z:hpo> suggests common mechanisms </plain></SENT>
