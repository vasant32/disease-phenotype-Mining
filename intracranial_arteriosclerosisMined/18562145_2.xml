<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Although it has been demonstrated that there is a high prevalence of extracranial carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> (ECAS) in patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo>, intracranial cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> (ICAS) is rarely mentioned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the prevalence of ICAS in patients with ECAS having elective coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery to determine the relations between ICAS, ECAS and atherosclerotic risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the digital subtraction angiography findings of 183 patients with ECAS&gt; or =50% preparing for CABG surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The analyses focused on the intracranial or extracranial location and degree of the stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The degree of extracranial stenoses were categorized as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, &lt;50%, 50-69%, 70-89%, and 90-99% stenosis and occluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The degree of intracranial stenosis was classified as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or &lt; or =25%, 25-49%, and &gt; or =50% stenosis and occluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Traditional atherosclerotic risk factors were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: ECAS&lt;70% in 42 patients and ECAS&gt; or =70% in 141 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ICAS was found in 51 patients and ICAS&gt; or =50% in 30 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Regarding risk factors, we found <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in 135 patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> in 91 patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo> in 84 patients, and smoking in 81 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No risk factor was significant predictors of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The severity of ICAS was not significantly associated with that of the ECAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We found ICAS in 27.8% of the patients with ECAS&gt;50% on digital subtraction angiography preparing for CABG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Therefore a complete evaluation of the neck vessels with magnetic resonance or catheter angiography seems to be indicated as well as intracranial circulation for the risk assessment of CABG </plain></SENT>
