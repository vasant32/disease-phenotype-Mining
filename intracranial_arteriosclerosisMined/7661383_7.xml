<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the nonbrain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> (non-BI) group (n = 13, mean age: sixty-two years), the regional CBF (rCBF) was decreased significantly with a rise in the mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) in the cerebral cortexes (r = -0.575) and the deep gray matter (r = -0.451), whereas the regional cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen (rCMRO2) remained unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> (BI) group (n = 22, mean age: fifty-eight years), however, the rCBF as well as the rCMRO2 were reduced even in the normotensive patients and thus did not correlate with the MABP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that long-standing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> per se causes a reduction in the rCBF but not in the oxygen metabolism with a compensatory increase in the oxygen extraction fraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>, even normotensives, show a diffuse decrease in cerebral circulation and metabolism, which is probably due to the more severe sclerotic changes that take place in the cerebral vessels </plain></SENT>
