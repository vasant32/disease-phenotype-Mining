<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In most of the cases there were crude pathological changes in the EEG in the form of a disorganization of bioelectrical activity, unstable and fragmental registrations and intrahemispheric asymmetry of biopotentials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These data are not in correlation with the nozological disorders, type of the oneiroid condition, but are in coordination with the character of emotional-volutional disturbances which accompany dream-like disorders of consciousness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the basis of stable pathological EEG changes which remain even during remissions, the authors come to the conclusion that these changes reflect the structural-functional disturbances of the brain which is the basis for the development of an oneiroid attack </plain></SENT>
