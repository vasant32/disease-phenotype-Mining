<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinical characteristics included the following: (1) this type of infarction was observed in 9.1% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>; (2) although 81.1% of the patients of this type had clear consciousness and neuropsychological symptoms in some patients; (3) motor <z:hpo ids='HP_0003470'>paralysis</z:hpo> usually occurred in the upper limbs; (4) monoplegia occurred in 13.2% of patients, with monoplegia of upper and lower limbs being associated with infarction of the anterior and posterior portion, respectively, of the <z:chebi fb="47" ids="37409">corona</z:chebi> radiata adjacent to the body of the lateral ventricle; (5) pure motor <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> was observed in 45.3% of patients; (6) facial <z:hpo ids='HP_0003470'>paralysis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001260'>dysarthria</z:hpo> were observed in 54.7% and 58.5% of patients, respectively, and the incidence of these symptoms was the highest in the infarction of the anterior portion of the <z:chebi fb="47" ids="37409">corona</z:chebi> radiata; (7) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0152027" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sensory disturbance</z:e>, which was usually recognized as a mild subjective feeling of abnormality and localized to the limbs, was reported by 47.2% of patients; (8) risk factors included <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and high hematocrit and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels; (9) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> was often noted in areas between the siphon of the internal carotid artery and the main stem of the anterior and middle cerebral arteries; (10) 64.2% of patients were able to conduct independent activities of daily life (ADL) 1 month after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the disease and more marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0003470'>paralysis</z:hpo> remained in the infarction of the middle portion than in the anterior or posterior portion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
