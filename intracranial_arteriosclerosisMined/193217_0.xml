<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Buffer-homogenates of grossly <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> arteries contained apoB amounts ranging from less than 0.04 to 1.58 microng/mg tissue dry weight, while those of atherosclerotic plaques gave values ranging from 0.80 to 3.9 microng per mg tissue dry weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These results were consistent with immunofluorescence studies localizing apoB in these arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Plaques also contained a remaining fraction of tightly-bound apoB as evidenced by positive immunofluorescence in sections of pellets from buffer homogenates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This was in contrast to the negative results from grossly <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results would suggest that retention of apoB by intracranial arteries correlates positively with vessel lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Arterial apoB is present in both grossly <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> regions and plaques in a loosely-bound form, possibly representing intact <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>ApoB is also present in a tightly-bound form in plaques </plain></SENT>
