We report the occurrence of Townes-Brocks syndrome (TBS) in an infant with a two break reciprocal translocation between chromosome 5 and chromosome 16. The occurrence of both abnormalities in the same subject could be due to chance. However, it is of interest to note that a familial case of TBS associated with an inv(16) with the same breakpoint at 16q12.1 has been reported. We suggest the possible disruption of the TBS gene at this breakpoint.
