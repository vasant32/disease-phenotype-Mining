Interpretation of a complex chromosome rearrangement (CCR) using only G-band analysis is difficult and potentially inaccurate. We present two patients with de novo, partially cryptic, CCRs that illustrate both the value and limitations of using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) whole chromosome paint probes to characterize these types of rearrangements. In a patient referred because of features of Townes-Brocks syndrome, G-band analysis revealed an unbalanced CCR involving 3 chromosomes (2,11 and 16) and at least 4 breakpoints. A more complex rearrangement involving two cryptic insertions and at least 6 breakpoints, however, was detected using whole chromosome paint probes specific for the 3 chromosomes involved in the rearrangement. In this case, FISH studies were essential for accurate characterization of this patient's rearrangement. In a second patient, G-band analysis revealed that a 12-year-old male with obesity, small genitalia, attention deficit disorder, learning disabilities, and behavior problems, carried a CCR involving 4 chromosomes (3, 5, 10 and 13) with 6 breakpoints. This rearrangement seemed unbalanced, with missing terminal 3p26. 2-pter material. Our G-band interpretation of this karyotype was confirmed by FISH using whole chromosome paint probes specific for the involved chromosomes. Although no evidence of the "missing" 3pter material was observed using a chromosome 3 paint, FISH analysis using a chromosome 3p unique telomere probe identified telomeric 3p material on the distal long arm of the derivative 10 chromosome. This case illustrates the limited value of painting probes to detect small rearrangements, especially those involving terminal chromosome regions.
