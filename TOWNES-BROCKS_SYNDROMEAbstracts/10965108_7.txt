SALL1 has been identified as one of now three human homologs of the region specific homeotic gene spalt (sal) of Drosophila, which encodes a zinc finger protein of characteristic structure. Mutations of SALL1 on chromosome 16q12.1 cause Townes-Brocks syndrome (TBS, OMIM no. 107480). In order to facilitate functional studies of this gene in a model organism, we searched for the murine homolog of SALL1. Here we report the genomic cloning, chromosome mapping, and partial expression analysis of the gene Sall1. Sequence comparison, Northern blot hybridization as well as the conserved chromosome location on the homologous mouse chromosome indicate that we have indeed isolated the murine homolog of SALL1.
