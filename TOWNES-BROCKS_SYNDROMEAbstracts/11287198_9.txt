In this study we describe cloning and expression of CSAL2, a second member of the spalt gene family in chick. All spalt proteins are characterized by the presence of multiple zinc-finger motifs, which are highly conserved. Mutations in HSAL1, a human spalt gene result in Townes-Brocks syndrome (TBS). We show here that CSAL2 is expressed in many of the tissues affected in TBS, including neural tissue, limb buds, mesonephros and cloaca.
