BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Redundant internal carotid arteries have been considered a risk factor in tonsillectomy, adenoidectomy, and surgical treatment of peritonsillar abscess and also a potentially treatable cause of stroke. However, an association between internal carotid artery redundancy and spontaneous dissection has not yet been clearly demonstrated. METHODS: We reviewed, for spontaneous carotid artery dissection, records of all patients admitted to our institution during the period from 1986 through 1992 with the diagnosis of stroke or transient ischemic attack. We also reviewed 108 percutaneous cerebral arteriograms performed between September 1992 and December 1992 for presence of carotid artery redundancies. RESULTS: Thirteen patients exhibited spontaneous dissection. Of these, 8 of 13 (62%) patients and 13 of 20 (65%) internal carotid arteries, viewed to the siphon, had significant redundancies, kinks, coils, or loops. Of 108 consecutive arteriograms of patients without dissection, in which 187 internal carotid arteries were viewed to the siphon, there were 20 (19%) patients and 22 (12%) of 187 vessels with significant redundancy. Five patients in the dissection group and 2 in the nondissection group had bilateral internal carotid artery redundancy (P = .0019 and P = .0001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: We found a significant correlation between internal carotid artery redundancy and dissection, particularly if redundancy is present bilaterally.
