BACKGROUND: Carotid artery dissection manifesting with symptomatic mass effect has been treated surgically according to the previous literature. Recently, some cases of carotid artery dissection manifesting with ischemic symptoms were treated successfully with endovascular insertion of coils after stenting. METHODS: A 42-year-old man with spontaneous dissection of the left cervical internal carotid artery (ICA) presented with the major complaint of left neck swelling and pain that was considered to be the mass effect of a pseudoaneurysm caused by dissection of the ICA. Endovascular therapy using a stent and coils was performed. The self-expanding stent was deployed to cover the neck of the pseudoaneurysm. A microcatheter was then guided through the stent mesh into the aneurysm, and coils were placed to pack it. RESULTS: Four months later, angiography revealed complete embolization of the aneurysm with preserved flow in the ICA. The mass effect attributable to the pseudoaneurysm was relieved symptomatically as well as radiologically. CONCLUSION: Cervical artery dissection with symptomatic mass effect++ can be treated successfully by the combination of stent and coils. This may be considered as an alternative to conventional proximal ligation, extracranial-intracranial bypass, or direct surgical repair.
