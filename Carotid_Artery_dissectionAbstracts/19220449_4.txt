 BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: There are only few small studies assessing potential risk factors, comorbidity, and prognostic factors in adult spontaneous cervicocerebral artery dissection (CAD). METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, hospital-based analysis on the prognostic factors and association of CAD with vascular risk factors in 301 consecutive Finnish patients, diagnosed from 1994 to 2007. RESULTS: Two thirds of the patients were men (68%). Women were younger than men. Migraine (36% of all patients), especially with visual aura (63% of all migraineurs), and smoking were more common in patients with CAD compared with the general Finnish population. At 3 months, 247 (83%) patients reached a favorable outcome. Occlusion of the dissected artery, internal carotid artery dissection (ICAD), and recent infection in infarction patients were associated with a poorer outcome. ICAD patients had less often brain infarction, but the strokes they had were more severe. Seven (2.3%) patients died during the follow-up (mean 4.0 years, 1186 patient years). Six (2%) patients had verified CAD recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence for the association of CAD with male sex, and possible association with smoking and migraine. Occlusion of the dissected artery, ICAD, and infection appear to be associated with poorer outcome.
