We report an autopsy case of a bilateral carotid artery dissection, following cervical manipulation by a chiropractor. To establish the etiology of a cervical artery dissection is important in view of possible legal implications and to exclude hereditary disorders, since cervical artery dissection has been linked to several arteriopathies. The underlying arteriopathy in the presented case was an idiopathic cystic medial degeneration. This report emphasizes the role of the pathologist in defining the underlying arteriopathy in carotid artery dissection.
