 BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Isolated focal common carotid artery dissection is a rare condition. CASE REPORT: A 43-year-old healthy woman suffered for the first time from a transient episode of word-finding difficulties, which was associated with her typical migraine headaches. A month prior to this event she had suffered from a minor whiplash injury. On routine work-up we found an isolated focal left common carotid mural hematoma and tiny acute left posterior watershed lesions on diffusion weighted images. CONCLUSION: Focal isolated common carotid artery dissection is a rare condition not to be overlooked. This case presents an incidental finding possibly of traumatic nature. In the presence of concomitant migraine its causal embolic relation to the transient word-finding difficulties must remain open.
