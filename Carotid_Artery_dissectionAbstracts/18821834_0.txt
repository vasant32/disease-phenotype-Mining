A MicroNester coil (MNC) was developed from the Nester coil with a 0.018-in microcatheter. The most specific feature of the MNC is the extended length of 14 cm. Neurointervention involving the MNC was undertaken in 11 patients. Intervention procedures were transvenous embolization for a dural arteriovenous fistula in 4 patients, transarterial embolization for a dural arteriovenous fistula in 2, parent artery occlusion for a cerebral aneurysm in 4, and stent-assisted embolization for a carotid artery dissection in 1. A push technique through microcatheter was used to deploy the MNCs. The MNCs were successfully placed into the venous sinus lesion, feeding artery, parent artery of the aneurysm, and the pseudoaneurysm. There were no major technical complications resulting in morbidity. The postoperative course was uneventful except in 2 cases in which the occluded vessel recanalized. Use of MNCs was safe and feasible for embolization of cerebrovascular lesions. Fewer coils are required in embolization when using MNCs.
