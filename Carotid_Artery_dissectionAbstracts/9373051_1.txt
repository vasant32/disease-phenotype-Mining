Recurrent dissections involving carotid, vertebral, or renal arteries have been described in patients with spontaneous cervical artery dissections, with a maximal interval between dissections of fourteen years. The authors describe 2 patients in whom aortic dissections developed twenty-five and forty years, respectively, following carotid artery dissections. These 2 patients constituted 8% of the total number of patients from Rochester, Minnesota, who were diagnosed with aortic dissection between 1987 and 1992. The first patient, a forty-five-year-old woman, presented in 1948 with right neck pain and headache, associated with several episodes of transient numbness of the right face and numbness and clumsiness of the left upper and lower extremities. Examination showed right miosis. Angiography showed a stenosis of the extracranial right internal carotid artery beginning several centimeters from the bifurcation. She died at age eighty-five from an aortic dissection. The second patient, a thirty-eight-year-old man, noted left orbital and frontotemporal headaches and drooping of the left eyelid in 1962. Examination showed left oculosympathetic palsy. Angiography showed stenosis and an aneurysm in the midportion of the extracranial left internal carotid artery. He died at age sixty-three from an aortic dissection. These cases suggest that following a carotid artery dissection the risk of a recurrent arterial dissection may remain elevated for a prolonged period of time and the recurrent dissection may involve the aorta.
