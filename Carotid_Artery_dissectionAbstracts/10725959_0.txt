A case of delayed postoperative visual loss due to bilateral traumatic carotid artery dissection is presented. In patients with a major craniofacial injury due to a high-speed motor vehicle accident, we suggest that carotid artery duplex ultrasonography be used in the initial evaluation for possible carotid artery dissection. Magnetic resonance imaging of the head and neck with magnetic resonance angiography should be performed subsequently if indicated. Early diagnosis and initiation of therapy can minimize complications.
