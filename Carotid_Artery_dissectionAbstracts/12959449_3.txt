The authors report on a case in which a carotid-cavernous fistula and an associated cavernous-carotid dissection developed in a 48-year-old man following a motor vehicle accident. The fistula was treated with coil embolization via a combined transarterial-transvenous approach. The dissected carotid artery segment was treated with a balloon-expandable stent, which restored normal caliber and hemispheric flow. There was no recurrence of the fistula and the postoperative wide patency of the carotid artery indicates that stent placement is an effective method of treating traumatic intracranial artery dissections.
