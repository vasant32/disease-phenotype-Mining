A case of iatrogenic intracranial artery dissection is reported. A 52-year-old female developed severe headache and nausea. Brain CT showed diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage. On admission, carotid angiography revealed an aneurysm in the right middle cerebral artery and the intact right internal carotid artery. The aneurysm was clipped successfully. Carotid angiography on day 7 revealed dissection in the right internal carotid artery. Repeated angiograms at 10 and 31 days showed progression of the carotid artery dissection. Findings of ECD-SPECT on day 31 (Balloon occlusion test) suggested low perfusion of the right internal carotid artery territory. The patient underwent surgical reconstruction of the right internal carotid artery using a radial artery. She presented with right abducens nerve palsy three days after the radial artery graft. The patency of the radial artery graft was proved by the post-operative angiography. Internal carotid artery dissection may occur spontaneously or as a result of trauma. An iatrogenic dissection is an uncommon complication of cerebral angiography. There are no evidence-based guidelines for the treatment although anticoagulation therapy is most commonly used. The present case emphasizes the usefulness of radial artery graft for traumatic carotid artery dissection.
