The pathogenesis of spontaneous cervical artery dissection remains unknown. Infection-mediated damage of the arterial wall may be an important triggering mechanism. We describe a 21 year-old man with respiratory infection (bronchial pneumonia) which was diagnosed and treated with antibiotic few days prior to the right internal carotid artery dissection. The patient presented ischemic retinal and cerebral strokes. Based on literature review, we discuss the possibility of a causal link between infection and arterial dissection.
