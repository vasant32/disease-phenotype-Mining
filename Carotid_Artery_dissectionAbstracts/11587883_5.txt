Carotid and vertebral artery dissection is a rarely reported cause of stroke in childhood and adolescence, especially if there is not a direct trauma to the neck. Four patients, under 15 years of age, presented with an internal carotid artery dissection, and one patient presented with a vertebral artery dissection. They were all making a physical effort when the event occurred. The five patients had ischemic symptoms, and in two the events were preceded by transient ischemic attacks. Headache was associated in four patients. The diagnosis was made by magnetic resonance imaging and angiography, which included transfemoral angiography in two patients. All improved before leaving the hospital, and four patients did not suffer recurrent episodes. The diagnostic accuracy of artery dissection has improved because of noninvasive neuroimaging testing, but it should still be suspected in any pediatric ischemic stroke, especially if there is headache or cervical pain associated.
