 PURPOSE: To report the use of a coronary stent-graft for the endovascular treatment of a spontaneous internal carotid artery (ICA) dissection complicated by a large pseudoaneurysm. CASE REPORT: A 68-year-old man presented to an outside hospital with complaints of headache, severe left-sided neck pain, fever, chills, and vomiting. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed a large (3.5x3 cm) extracranial aneurysm of the left ICA. The patient was emergently transferred to our facility for endovascular treatment of the carotid aneurysm. Via a percutaneous access in the right common femoral artery, 2 Jostent coronary stent-grafts were deployed across the aneurysm with no evidence of a residual pseudoaneurysm. The patient was hemodynamically stable throughout the procedure. Duplex examination at 9 months revealed no evidence of a residual pseudoaneurysm, dissection, or endoleak. CONCLUSIONS: Covered coronary stents may have a role in the treatment of spontaneous ICA dissection with pseudoaneurysm formation.
