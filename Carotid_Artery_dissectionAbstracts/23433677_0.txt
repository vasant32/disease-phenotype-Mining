BACKGROUND AND IMPORTANCE: Direct puncture may offer an alternative access for embolization of intracranial aneurysms in patients presenting with tortuous vessels. Nevertheless, major complications such as compressive hematoma and arterial dissection can occur with this technique. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A tight common carotid artery (CCA) dissection was seen secondary to direct puncture in a 72-year-old patient who presented with a ruptured anterior communicating artery (ACom) aneurysm. After regular coiling of the aneurysm and using a femoral approach, an Angio-Sealâ„¢ device (St Jude Medical, Saint Paul, MN, USA) was placed and a carotid wallstent (Stryker Neurovascular, Fremont, CA, USA) successfully deployed at the dissected CCA, which was followed by good clinical and angiographic outcomes. CONCLUSION: A combined rescue technique combining Angio-Seal insertion and stent deployment was safe and effective for managing iatrogenic carotid artery dissection.
