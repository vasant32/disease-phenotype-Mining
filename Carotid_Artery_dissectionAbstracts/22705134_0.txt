This study aimed to compare traumatic and spontaneous carotid artery dissection (CAD) and vertebral artery dissection (VAD) with respect to age, pre-morbid risk factors, and site of dissection. Chart review was performed for 49 patients with CAD and VAD admitted to Westchester Medical Center, a level 1 trauma center, from 1999 to 2007. Presentation was categorized into traumatic (n=28, 57%) or spontaneous dissection (n=21, 43%). Pre-morbid risk factors were analyzed. Location of dissection was identified and categorized into four possible segments. Patients with spontaneous dissection were likely to be over the age of 50 years (p<0.05), and had significantly higher proportions of coronary artery disease (33% compared to 7%, p<0.05), hypertension (57% compared to 18%; p<0.01), and hypercholesterolemia (29% compared to 0%; p<0.01). Of the 49 patients, 42 had imaging studies available for segmental analysis. In both traumatic CAD and VAD, dissection at Segment III (corresponds with the first and second cervical vertebrae), was the most common site (37.5% and 50%, respectively, p<0.05). In contrast, Segment I (origin of the vessel to the fifth cervical vertebrae) was the most common site for spontaneous CAD and VAD (55% and 77%, respectively, p<0.05). This cross-sectional study suggests that etiology plays an important role in the location of dissection. Traumatic CAD and VAD occur most commonly in Segment III. Spontaneous CAD and VAD occur most commonly in Segment I and are associated with increasing age and premorbid cerebrovascular risk factors.
