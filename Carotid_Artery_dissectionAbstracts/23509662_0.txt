Internal carotid artery dissection (ICAD) is an important cause of acute ischemic stroke in younger patients. Potential acute treatments include anticoagulation, intravenous thrombolysis (IVT), and endovascular thrombectomy (ET). We report a case where the use of IVT followed by ET resulted in a good clinical outcome in a patient with tandem internal carotid and middle cerebral artery occlusion following ICAD.
