A 30-year-old woman with severe preeclampsia presented at 27weeks of amenorrhea with left headache, neck pain, blurred vision and numbness of left hemiface that resolved spontaneously within 2hours. A week later, hypertension remained poorly controlled despite combination of nicardipine and labetalol intravenous therapy; an urgent caesarean section was eventually performed due to onset of HELLP syndrome. At day 5 postpartum, the patient had a Horner syndrome with right ipsilateral disabling tinnitus. A CT-angiography of supra-aortic trunks was performed urgently; it showed a bilateral carotid arterial dissection without stroke, which was subsequently confirmed by MRI angiography. The patient was transferred in neurovascular intensive care unit. Anticoagulant therapy was implemented to prevent cerebral and retinal ischemic lesions. Symptoms resolved quickly and the patient was discharged at day 7 postpartum. MR-angiography performed 4months later showed a full resolution of the bilateral carotid dissection. Anticoagulant therapy was therefore discontinued.
