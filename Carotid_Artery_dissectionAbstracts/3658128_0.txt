Axial computed tomographic (CT) scans after intravenous contrast infusion were used to image the cervical carotid arteries of patients with cerebral ischemic symptoms. Standard transfemoral cervical carotid and cerebral angiography was the principal diagnostic modality used in all patients studied. The angiographic results were compared to the CT images and to the gross and microscopic endarterectomy pathological specimens, when available. Examples of the various types of abnormalities that can be visualized using CT scans are presented. The CT scan was useful for determining the presence of degenerative atheromatous changes including carotid artery calcification, subintimal hemorrhage, carotid occlusion, carotid segmental occlusion, and carotid pseudoocclusion, as well as carotid artery dissection. The scans were particularly useful for identification of atheromatous carotid artery disease when the carotid angiogram appeared nearly normal and for identifying the cause of postoperative carotid stenosis. CT scanning allows visualization of the carotid artery wall and lumen rather than just the lumen and, consequently, can sometimes add helpful information about the pathological processes affecting this artery.
