Arterial stroke in a neonate caused by carotid artery dissection is rare. We report two cases, one with dissection at the level of the skull base, one just distal to the carotid bulb. Non-invasive techniques like MR angiography and sonography demonstrated the dissection accurately. MR imaging, especially the diffusion-weighted images, showed the extension and site of the cerebral infarction. In one case dissection could be suspected following vacuum and forceps extraction. In the other no obvious birth trauma was reported. In conclusion, in a neonate with clinical signs suggestive of cerebral infarction, dissection of the carotid artery should be considered.
