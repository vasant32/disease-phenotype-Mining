A 45-year-old woman presented with headache, followed by dysphagia and dysphonia. Examination revealed IX, X and XII cranial nerve weakness. Magnetic resonance angiography of neck vessels confirmed a left internal carotid artery dissection at the skull base, with haematoma in the aneurysmal left internal carotid artery. This dilated area of the internal carotid artery was thought to be pressing on the lower cranial nerves as they exited the base of the skull. Symptoms improved with nasogastric feeding, speech therapy and antiplatelet agents. At follow up she had complete resolution of dysphagia, but hypophonia persisted. Magnetic resonance angiography revealed improvement in the appearances of the aneurysmal left internal carotid artery. This is an uncommon presentation of carotid artery dissection and management is debatable.
