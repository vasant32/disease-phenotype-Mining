The rate and risk factors for early ischemic recurrence in patients with internal carotid artery dissection (ICAD) are largely unknown. Serial transcranial Doppler (TCD) monitoring of microembolic signals (MES) was performed in 28 consecutive patients with acute ICAD. MES were identified in 13 patients, and early ischemic recurrence occurred in 7. Six of 13 patients with MES and 1 of 15 without MES experienced early ischemic recurrence (p = 0.029). MES detection on serial TCD monitoring may be associated with an increased risk of early ischemic recurrence in patients with acute ICAD.
