BACKGROUND: The pathogenesis of cervical artery dissection remains unknown. Infection-mediated damage of the arterial wall may be one contributing mechanism. We present three male patients with respiratory infection prior to cervical artery dissection. CASE DESCRIPTIONS: Case 1: During an upper respiratory tract infection, a 49-year-old patient developed bilateral carotid and vertebral artery dissection with complete vessel restitution. Case 2: Within 3 years, a 40-year-old patient experienced two episodes of bilateral internal carotid artery dissection, both preceded by febrile upper respiratory tract infection. Case 3: A 52-year-old patient developed right-sided and, 2 years later, left-sided internal carotid artery dissection, each following upper respiratory tract infection. CONCLUSIONS: Infection may be a trigger factor in the pathogenesis of cervical artery dissection.
