Takayasu arteritis is a rare vasculitis of the aorta and its branches. Neurological manifestation usually results from central nervous system ischaemia. We report a case presenting with unilateral paresis of the cranial nerves (V, IX and XII nerve) caused by a vascular conflict due to Takayasu arteritis. A 38-year-old male was admitted to the hospital complaining of dysarthria, dysphagia, numbness of the right side of the tongue and a headache localized behind the right eye. The symptoms had sudden onset. Neurological examination revealed isolated trigeminal, glossopharyngeal and hypoglossal nerve dysfunction on the right side without other neurological symptoms. Magnetic resonance angiography showed internal carotid artery dissection and prominent thickening of walls of both vertebral arteries as well as the left renal artery with narrowing of lumen. Compression of glossopharyngeal and hypoglossal nerves and the trigeminal ganglion was a result of a markedly dilated intracranial segment of the right carotid artery. The clinical and radiological findings were consistent with the diagnosis of Takayasu arteritis.
