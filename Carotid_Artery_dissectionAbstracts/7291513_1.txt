The authors describe 3 patients with Raeder syndrome who also had lesions of the internal carotid artery in the region of the ascending sympathetic chain. One patient apparently had weakening of the artery wall, caused by extension of inflammatory disease, with hemorrhage brought on by exertion; another patient had a psuedoaneurysm possibly related to biopsy or irradiation, while a third had an aneurysm which may have been caused by a carotid artery dissection at the time of a whiplash injury many years earlier.
