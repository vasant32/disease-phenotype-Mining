 INTRODUCTION: A rare but significant cause for stroke is sub-intimal carotid dissection and this mechanism accounts for approximately 2.5% of all strokes.(1) Dissection of the carotid artery is often caused by trauma to the face or neck.(2) Under 45 years old, it is the second leading cause of stroke.(3) Neurological symptoms can be lacking or subtle, therefore the condition may be overlooked but the pathological processed is believed to be attributed to thromboembolism.(4) Microemboli in the middle cerebral artery, are known as a risk factor for ischaemic stroke following a transient ischaemic attack (TIA) and can be detected by transcranial Doppler examination (TCD).(5) The established treatment regime is antiplatelet therapy, anticoagulation or both along with supportive therapy.(6) Current evidence suggests managing microemboli in both crescendo TIA's and post carotid endarterectomy improves outcome.(7) We have found the use of Tirofiban, a potent intravenous antiplatelet agent currently licensed for use in acute coronary syndrome, effective in the treatment of microemboli in this manner.(7) CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of symptomatic carotid artery dissection post radical neck dissection, causing TCD detected microemboli and successfully treated with Tirofiban. CONCLUSION: We believe further study into the use of Tirofiban in the treatment of microemboli after carotid dissection is indicated.
