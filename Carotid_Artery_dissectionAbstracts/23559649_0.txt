We describe a case of a 33-year-old skydiver who presented to the emergency department after a traumatic landing following a parachuting episode. He initially presented with right knee pain secondary to a tibial plateau fracture. There were no neurological symptoms or signs at the initial assessment. While he was still in the emergency department, he suddenly developed headache and left-sided hemiplegia. An urgent work-up showed right middle cerebral artery thrombosis with right internal carotid thrombosis and dissection. We have discussed some possible mechanism of injury in skydiving that may have predisposed to the occurrence of cervical dissection in our patient.
