 BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We set out to investigate the predictors and time course for recanalization of spontaneous dissection of the cervical internal carotid artery (SICAD). METHODS: We prospectively included 249 consecutive patients (mean age, 45+/-11 years) with 268 SICAD. Ultrasound examinations were performed at presentation, during the first month, and then at 3, 6, and 12 months, and clinical follow-ups after 3, 6, and 12 months. RESULTS: Of 268 SICADs, 20 (7.5%) presented with <or=50% stenosis, 31 (11.6%) with 51% to 80% stenosis, 92 (34.3%) with 81% to 99% stenosis, and 125 (46.6%) with an occlusion. Antithrombotic treatment included anticoagulation in 174 (67%) patients, aspirin in 64 (24%) patients, and aspirin followed by anticoagulation or vice versa in 22 (8%) patients. Follow-up ultrasound showed normal findings in 160 (60%), <or=50% stenosis in 27 (10%), 51% to 80% stenosis in 4 (1%), 81% to 99% stenosis in 26 (10%), and occlusion in 51 (19%) vessels. The rate of complete recanalization was 16% at 1 month, 50% at 3 months, and 60% at 6 and 12 months. Initial occlusion of the dissected vessels reduced the odds of recanalization (OR, 4.0; 95% CI, 2.2-7.3; P<0.001), whereas the occurrence of local symptoms and signs only at presentation were independently associated with complete recanalization (OR, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.2-0.8; P=0.048). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that recanalization of SICAD occurs mainly within the first 6 months after the onset of symptoms. Initial occlusion reduces the likelihood of complete recanalization, whereas presentation with local symptoms and signs only increases it.
