 PURPOSE: To determine the value of color Doppler sonography (CDUS) in the diagnosis and follow-up of patients with extracranial and intracranial vertebral artery (VA) dissection. METHOD: Thirty-three patients aged 42 +/- 12 years with 40 VADS confirmed via digital subtraction angiography (DSA) (n = 37) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) (n = 3) were included in the study. All patients were investigated with extracranial CDUS and transcranial CDUS (TCCDUS) over a mean +/- SD follow-up period of 42 +/- 24 months and occurrence of new ischemic symptoms was assessed. Sonographic results were compared with initial and follow-up angiographic results. RESULTS: At presentation, 24/33 (73%) patients had suffered an ischemic stroke, 5/33 (15%) had a transient ischemic attack (TIA), and 4/33 (12%) were asymptomatic. Two patients had a recurrent vertebrobasilar TIA; there was no recurrent stroke. The initial DSA findings consisted of 14 stenoses, 20 tapered occlusions, and 6 pseudoaneurysms. During follow-up, 63% of the vessels recanalized. Sonographic findings were consistent with angiographic findings in 80% at the initial examination and in 86% during follow-up. The main reason for discordant results was the failure of CDUS to detect pseudoaneurysms. No recurrence occurred in the vertebral arteries (VA), but 1 patient had an asymptomatic carotid artery dissection during follow-up. CONCLUSION: Recurrent TIA or stroke after VAD appears to be extremely rare, independent of recanalization or persistent occlusion of the affected artery. CDUS and TCCDUS provide reliable follow-up of VAD in all patients presenting with stenosis or occlusion, but do not allow for detection of pseudoaneurysms of the VA.
