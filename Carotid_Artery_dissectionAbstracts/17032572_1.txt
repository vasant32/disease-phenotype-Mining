When a patient with migraine has a stroke, all other causes of stroke should be ruled out before the stroke is attributed to migraine. Migraine mimics that present with headaches and stroke, including arteriovenous malformation and cervical carotid artery dissection, should be considered. Patent foramen ovale is a risk factor for both migraine and stroke and should be ruled out with transesophageal echocardiography. A patient with migraine with aura with persistent focal neurologic deficits in the distribution of the typical aura can be diagnosed with migrainous stroke. Patients with migraine with aura with persistent focal neurologic deficits can be treated pharmacologically with intravenous verapamil or magnesium sulfate to relieve the symptoms in familial hemiplegic migraine and sporadic hemiplegic migraine. Prophylactic treatment should be administered to patients with frequent attacks of migraine with aura to prevent recurrence. Oral verapamil is recommended for patients with familial hemiplegic migraine and may be effective in patients with sporadic hemiplegic migraine. Endovascular closure of patent foramen ovale has been reported to prevent recurrence of migraine with aura. The role of patent foramen ovale closure remains controversial pending completion of controlled randomized trials.
