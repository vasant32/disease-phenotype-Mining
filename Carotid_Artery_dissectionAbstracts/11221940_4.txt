Exposure of the distal internal carotid artery (ICA) above the level of the second cervical vertebra can be difficult and often require maneuvers such as division of the digastric muscle or mandibular subluxation. These techniques increase exposure but may not provide adequate access. We report a series of eight cases in which vertical division of the mandibular ramus provided access of the ICA up to the base of the skull. Over the last 10 years, eight patients underwent vertical ramus osteotomy (VRO) to aid in distal ICA exposure. Preoperative arteriography revealed ICA lesions within 1.5 cm of the skull base. Indications for surgery were compelling and included gunshot wounds to zone III of the neck (n = 2), transient ischemic attack (n = 2), and preocclusive stenosis (n = 4). VRO was performed through a standard vertical neck incision and was created from the depth of the sigmoid notch to the angle of the mandible after elevating the masseter muscle from the bone. Miniature titanium plates were used to reapproximate the mandible after endarterectomy (n = 5), bypass (n = 2), or arterial repair (n = 1). We found that VRO provides reliable exposure of the distal ICA up to the base of the skull. Unlike mandibular subluxation, it requires no pre-incision preparation, thus mandibulotomy can be performed after carotid artery dissection has begun, and may even be avoided. VRO is especially useful when carotid artery pathology unexpectedly extends beyond the usual field of exposure. Work on the carotid artery at the skull base is associated with significant complications and should be reserved for compelling indications.
