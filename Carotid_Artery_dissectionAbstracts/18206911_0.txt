Traumatic carotid dissection is a well-known cause of ischemic stroke and although the treatment of the dissection itself has received some attention in recent years, the treatment of the concomitant stroke has been less investigated. We present a 43-year-old patient with blunt traumatic internal carotid artery dissection associated with subocclusive stenosis and major cerebral thromboembolic complication. Combined, simultaneous intra-arterial fibrinolysis and carotid stenting through a bilateral approach was successfully performed allowing the complete clinical recovery of the patient. Contralateral carotid artery approach allowed the beginning of intra-arterial thrombolysis without delay, while stent-assisted angioplasty of the injured carotid was simultaneously performed. This approach was proved to be safe and effective and may deserve further evaluation.
