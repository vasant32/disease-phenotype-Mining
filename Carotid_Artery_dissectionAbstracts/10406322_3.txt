A case of internal carotid artery dissection that developed after rigid esophagoscopy is described. The diagnosis was suggested by the clinical presentation and confirmed by the findings of radiological examinations. Internal carotid artery dissection is a rare condition of controversial etiology. Most frequently, the cause is unknown and the condition is termed idiopathic. A few cases have occurred after forceful cervical extensions and manipulations. The pathogenesis in our case is uncertain: while the rigid esophagoscopy is the most probable cause, the intubation and spontaneous carotid artery dissection cannot be ruled out.
