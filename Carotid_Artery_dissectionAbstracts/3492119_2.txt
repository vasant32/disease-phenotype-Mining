Spontaneous dissection of the internal carotid artery is being recognized as a more frequent cause of acute neurologic deficit, particularly in young persons. Saccular pseudoaneurysm formation may be an associated finding, especially in the presence of tortuosity (coiling) of the cervical internal carotid artery. Of eight patients with nine vessels demonstrating internal carotid artery dissection on arteriography, pseudoaneurysms were found in five arteries. Four of the five pseudoaneurysms occurred in tortuous (coiled) arterial segments. Thin-section contrast-enhanced dynamic incremental CT showed close agreement with the findings on selective arteriography and provided additional information on the presence and configuration of arterial wall thickening as well as the extent of the pseudoaneurysm. Our experience indicates that CT may play an important role in the diagnosis, management, and follow-up of this lesion.
