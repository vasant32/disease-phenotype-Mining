Two young patients, an 18-year-old woman and a 25-year-old man, were admitted to hospital after accidents with a car. They developed very severe complications as a consequence of blunt carotid artery dissection. This diagnosis was delayed in both patients until serious cerebral ischaemia had occurred. Despite current awareness of carotid dissection as a possible result of blunt trauma, this injury is often overlooked. Early diagnosis by means of Doppler ultrasonography and CT-angiography is important in adequate management of this injury and may reduce morbidity and mortality. The treatment of carotid dissection consists of antithrombotic, endovascular or surgical therapy and needs to be individualized.
