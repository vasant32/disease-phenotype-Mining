 BACKGROUND: Internal carotid artery dissection is a cause of ischemic stroke, particularly in young patients, without known cerebro-vascular risk factors. METHODS: The authors describe the clinical and imagiological (CT scan, MRI and digital subtraction angiography) records of five patients admitted during a period of two months in the Stroke Unit of Hospital de S. Jos√©, with the diagnosis of internal carotid artery occlusion with probable dissection. COMMENT: The clinical cases presented reflect the heterogeneity of clinical and imagiological presentation of carotid artery dissection.
