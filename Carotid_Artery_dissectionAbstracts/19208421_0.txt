We present the sonographic finding of flapping of the dissected intima inside the carotid artery in a 48-year-old man who suffered an acute stroke after vigorous use of a jackhammer. The dissected intima was seen to flap inside the lumen regularly and in synchrony with the vessel's pulse. There was no distal segmental stenosis. The extracranial blood flow velocities were within normal limits and transcranial Doppler examination did not reveal any velocity alteration.
