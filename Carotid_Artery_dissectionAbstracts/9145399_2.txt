The recognized incidence of extra- and intracranial carotid artery dissection has increased concomitantly with the progress and development of diagnostic methods. However, management for this condition is still controversial. We report in the present study the management and long-term follow-up results of 15 patients with carotid artery dissection. Mean age of the patients at onset was 47.8 years old, and male/female ratio was 12:3. Two patients were considered to be traumatic dissections and the other 13 patients were spontaneous dissections. Dissection occurred in 10 patients at the extracranial carotid artery, in 4 at the intracranial carotid artery and in 1 at the middle cerebral artery. Nine of 15 patients demonstrated hemiparesis and 5 complained of headache or facial pain. However, it was not possible to identify a characteristic symptom of dissection. Final diagnosis of dissection was made by cerebral angiography in all patients. Serial angiography was carried out in 10 of those, and 5 of the 10 patients showed some improvements of dissection in the cerebral angiogram. Treatment for those patients was selected according to the neurological and angiographical changes. Five patients were managed conservatively and 10 patients underwent surgical revascularization. During the follow-up period (mean 77.6 months), none of them showed any symptoms of reattack, and all but one, who died of heart failure 193 months after revascularization surgery, have lived independently. Although diagnosis of dissection was difficult because of the lack of characteristic symptom, serial angiography was a useful method for diagnosis and adequate management has led to a good clinical outcome.
