We report a case of spontaneous internal carotid artery dissection in a young patient resulting in vagal (X) and accessory (XI) nerve palsies. Clinical examination revealed right shoulder and laryngeal paralysis, with preservation of velar function. This corresponds to Garel-Gignoux syndrome. However, this patient also had hemipharyngeal paralysis, which Gignoux did not report in his case.
