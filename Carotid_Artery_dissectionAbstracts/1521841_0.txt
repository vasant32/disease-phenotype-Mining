A typical case history of spontaneous dissection of the internal carotid artery is presented. In young patients with cerebral ischemia, initial pain in the affected side of the head and neck, a possible provocative mechanism and a transient or even persistent Horner's syndrome are highly suggestive. The angiographic picture of carotid artery dissection is characteristic. Spontaneous resolution is common, and recurrence rare. Surgical treatment can therefore be reserved for individual cases with recurrent ischemia and caused by emboli originating in the dissected segment of the artery.
