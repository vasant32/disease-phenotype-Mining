 INTRODUCTION: Concurrent abuse of alcohol and cocaine results in the formation of cocaethylene, a powerful cocaine metabolite. Cocaethylene potentiates the direct cardiotoxic and indirect neurotoxic effects of cocaine or alcohol alone. CASE REPORT: A 44-year-old female with history of cocaine and alcohol abuse presented with massive stroke in the emergency department. CT scan revealed extensive left internal carotid artery dissection extending into the left middle and anterior cerebral arteries resulting in a massive left hemispheric infarct, requiring urgent decompressive craniectomy. The patient had a stormy hospital course with multiple episodes of torsades de pointes in the first 4 days requiring aggressive management. She survived all events and was discharged to a nursing home with residual right hemiplegia and aphasia. CONCLUSION: The combination of ethanol and cocaine has been associated with a significant increase in the incidence of neurological and cardiac emergencies including cerebral infarction, intracranial hemorrhage, myocardial infarction, cardiomyopathy, and cardiac arrhythmias. The alteration of cocaine pharmacokinetics and the formation of cocaethylene have been implicated, at least partially, in the increased toxicity of this drug combination.
