Collet-Sicard syndrome is a rare condition, defined as unilateral palsy of the last four cranial nerves. It differs from Villaret syndrome because of absence of sympathetic involvement. Collet-Sicard syndrome is most often caused by skull tumors, carotid artery dissections or head and neck trauma. We report the case of a 57-year-old man who presented palsy of the left lower cranial nerves IX-XII linked to carotid artery dissection after trivial neck injury.
