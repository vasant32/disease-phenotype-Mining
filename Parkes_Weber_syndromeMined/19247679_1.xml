<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we investigated a certain type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002171'>gliosis</z:hpo>, called satellitosis, in the lateral amygdala (LA) of TLE patients with Ammon's horn <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> (AHS, n = 15) and non-AHS (n = 12), and in autopsy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Satellite cells were quantified using light and electron microscopy at the somata of Nissl-stained and glutamic acid decarboxylase-negative projection neurons, and their functional properties were studied using electrophysiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Non-AHS cases suffered from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0206716" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">ganglioglioma</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002539'>cortical dysplasia</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0009592'>astrocytoma</z:hpo> WHO III-IV, Rasmussen's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002383'>encephalitis</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852862" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">perinatal brain damage</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>TLE cases with AHS had a more prominent satellitosis as compared to non-AHS and/or autopsy cases, which correlated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> duration but not age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At ultrastructural level, the predominant type of satellite cells occurring in both AHS and non-AHS cases displayed a dark cytoplasm and an irregularly shaped dark nucleus, whereas perineuronal glial cells with a light cytoplasm and light oval nucleus were much rarer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Satellite cells expressed time- and voltage-dependent transmembrane currents as revealed by patch-clamp recordings typical for 'complex' glia, although only 44% of satellite cells were immunostained for the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37397">chondroitin sulfate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37396">proteoglycan</z:chebi> NG2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Together, the perineuronal cells described here were a heterogenous cell population regarding their NG2 expression, although they resembled NG2 cells rather than bona fide oligodendrocytes and astrocytes based on their ultrastructural and electrophysiological characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, perineuronal satellitosis as studied in the LA seems to be a hallmark of AHS-associated TLE pathology in patients suffering from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096063" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intractable epilepsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
