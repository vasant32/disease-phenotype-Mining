<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate if elevated D-dimer level is specific for venous malformations (VMs) and thus useful for differential diagnosis, which can be problematic even in specialized interdisciplinary centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Localized intravascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0003256'>coagulopathy</z:hpo>, characterized by elevated D-dimer levels, has been observed in approximately 40% of patients with VMs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Prospective convenience sample accrued from 2 interdisciplinary sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Two interdisciplinary centers for vascular anomalies in Brussels, Belgium, and Caen, France PARTICIPANTS: The study population comprised 280 patients with clinical data, Doppler ultrasonograms (for 251 patients), and coagulation parameter measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Main Outcome Measure Measurement of D-dimer levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A VM was diagnosed in 195 of 280 patients (69.6%), and 83 of them had elevated D-dimer levels; the sensitivity of D-dimer dosage was 42.6% (95% confidence interval, 35.6%-49.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among the 85 patients without VM, D-dimer levels were elevated only in 3 patients; the specificity of the dosage was 96.5% (95% confidence interval, 92.5%-100%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Elevated D-dimer level is highly specific for VMs (pure, combined, or syndromic), and therefore this easy and inexpensive biomarker test should become part of the clinical evaluation of vascular anomalies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It can detect hidden VMs and help differentiate glomuvenous malformation (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> D-dimer levels) from other multifocal venous lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Elevated D-dimer level also differentiates a VM from a lymphatic malformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Moreover, slow-flow <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022739" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="KTS">Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome</z:e> (capillaro-lymphatico-venous malformation with limb <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath>) can be distinguished from fast-flow <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505,C0022739" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Parkes Weber syndrome</z:e> (capillary malformation with underlying multiple microfistulas and limb <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>For these reasons, D-dimer level measurement is a useful complementary tool for diagnosing vascular anomalies in everyday practice </plain></SENT>
