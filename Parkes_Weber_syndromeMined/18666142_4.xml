<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy of susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) in comparison to standard T1 weighted postgadolinium contrast (T1-Gd) MRI in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber Syndrome (SWS)</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twelve children (mean age, 5.6 years) with the diagnosis of SWS and unilateral hemispheric involvement were recruited prospectively and examined with high resolution three dimensional SWI and conventional T1-Gd </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both SWI and T1-Gd images were evaluated using a four-grade scoring system according to six types of imaging findings (enlargement of transmedullary veins, periventricular veins, and choroid plexus, as well as leptomeningeal abnormality, cortical gyriform abnormality, and gray matter/white matter junctional abnormality) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The scores of SWI versus T1-Gd images were then compared for each type of abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: SWI was superior to T1-Gd in identifying the enlarged transmedullary veins (P = 0.0020), abnormal periventricular veins (P = 0.0078), cortical gyriform abnormalities (P = 0.0020), and gray matter/white matter junction abnormalities (P = 0.0078) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Conversely, T1-Gd was better than SWI in identifying enlarged choroid plexus (P = 0.0050) and leptomeningeal abnormalities (P = 0.0050) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: SWI can provide useful and unique information complementary to conventional contrast enhanced T1 weighted MRI for characterizing SWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, SWI should be integrated into routine clinical MRI protocols for suspected SWS </plain></SENT>
