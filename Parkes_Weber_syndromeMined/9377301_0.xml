<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: The syndrome, or disease, or Sturge Weber (SSW) is a neuro-ectodermic disorder of unknown incidence, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> presentation and specific sex incidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is characterized by the presence of a flat, facial <z:mp ids='MP_0002947'>angioma</z:mp> which affects at least the first branch of the trigeminal nerve, association with ipsilateral leptomeningeal vascular anomalies, one or more symptoms (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e>, hemiparesia, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo>) and ipsilateral vascular lesions of the choroid which lead to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As a consequence of lepto-meningeal involvement, homolateral cerebral hemi-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> develops together with cortico-subcortical calcifications with a characteristic "railway line" appearance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL CASE: We present the case of a six month old girl with a flat port wine <z:mp ids='MP_0002947'>angioma</z:mp> on the left half of her face, including three branches of the trigeminal nerve and the left half of her body </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>She had partial motor crises of the right leg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the cranial CT there were left periventricular calcifications and calcifications of the choroid plexus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">Gadolinium</z:chebi>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> showed signs of left cerebral hemi-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath>, which was confirmed on the cerebral SPECT (left temporal hypoperfusion) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This case is interesting on account of the presence of atypical calcifications, both with regard to the sites and age of presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We emphasize the need for cranial CT to rule out the presence of calcifications, (as in this case) not seen on Xray of the skull or on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We favour the use of cerebral SPECT as a complementary diagnostic technique </plain></SENT>
