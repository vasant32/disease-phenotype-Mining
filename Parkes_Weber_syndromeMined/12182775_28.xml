<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Spinal cord arteriovenous shunts (SCAVSs) are currently classified according to their morphological features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Certain shunts cannot be fully integrated into the predetermined categories that are usually described, however </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="?"><plain>Can these classifications be reevaluated on the basis of recent anatomic, biological, and genetic advances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed the clinical and radiological files for 155 SCAVSs that were treated at Hôpital Bicêtre between 1981 and 1999 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The lesions were examined with respect to their number (single or multiple), their primary architectural type (nidus or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath>), and their possible links with associated metameric lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> SCAVSs were either <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformations</z:hpo> or fistulae, with the latter being either micro- or macrofistulae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> SCAVSs corresponded to three categories, i.e., genetic hereditary lesions (macrofistulae and hereditary hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001009'>telangiectasia</z:hpo>), genetic nonhereditary lesions (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of which were multiple lesions with metameric or myelomeric associations), and single lesions (which could represent incomplete presentations of one of the previous groups) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the SCAVSs in our series, 81% were single lesions and 19% were multiple; among these, 59% were true intradural shunts with metameric features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ten cases of Cobb syndrome, three cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022739" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="KTS">Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome</z:e>, and two cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505,C0022739" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Parkes-Weber syndrome</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> with associated cord lesions, were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Nineteen percent of SCAVSs were fistulae; 23% of those were macrofistulae, of which 83% were related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039445" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Rendu-Osler-Weber disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: It seems legitimate to propose a categorization that takes into consideration a primary malformation (nidus or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath>) that evolves with time and in which angioarchitectural changes occur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Recognition of the factors originally responsible for the shunt (e.g., genetic hereditary or genetic nonhereditary) allows a different classification of SCAVSs </plain></SENT>
