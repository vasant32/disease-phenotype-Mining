<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To evaluate if abnormal diffusion and metabolism of the thalamus, a central relay station with extensive cortical connections, may serve as a simple imaging marker of neuro-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive dysfunction</z:e> in SWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We obtained both diffusion tensor imaging and FDG PET in 20 children (11 girls; age range: 3-12.4 years) with unilateral SWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diffusion parameters as well as FDG uptake were measured in thalami, compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control values, and correlated with the extent of cortical hypometabolism, deep <z:hpo ids='HP_0002624'>venous abnormalities</z:hpo> and cognitive (IQ) as well as fine motor functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Children with SWS had significantly higher thalamic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolic asymmetry than controls (p=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thalamic metabolic asymmetries correlated positively with the asymmetry of thalamic diffusivity (p=0.001) and also with the extent of cortical hypometabolism (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Severe thalamic asymmetries of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism and diffusion were strong predictors of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0848034" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">low IQ</z:e> (metabolism: p=0.002; diffusivity: p=0.01), even after controlling for age and extent of cortical <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> hypometabolism in children with left hemispheric involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ipsilateral thalamic <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> hypometabolism was also associated with impairment of fine motor functions (p=0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Both diffusion and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0010663'>abnormalities of the thalamus</z:hpo> are closely related to cognitive functions, independent of age and cortical <z:mp ids='MP_0005266'>metabolic abnormalities</z:mp>, in children with unilateral SWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thalamic metabolic asymmetry is a robust but simple imaging marker of neuro-cognitive outcome in children with early unilateral hemispheric injury caused by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
