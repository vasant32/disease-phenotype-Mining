<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared two groups of children with SWS-- one with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> (n=20) and one without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> (n=14)--on parent-report and teacher-report measures of behavioral and academic functioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The two subgroups were compared with each other as well as with children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> alone (n=29) and a group of healthy controls (n=21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The SWS group with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> was more impaired than the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo>-free group on 9 of 15 measures and the children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> were 10 times as likely to have received special education services </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overall, children with SWS and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> were similar to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> group, whereas children with SWS and no <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> were similar to the controls </plain></SENT>
