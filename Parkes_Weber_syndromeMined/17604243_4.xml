<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001052'>Port-wine stains</z:hpo> are capillary malformations that commonly involve the skin of the head and neck region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They may affect the underlying subcutaneous tissue and bone, and extend on to adjacent mucous membrane and conjunctiva </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ipsilateral leptomeningeal and ocular choroidal involvement occurs in a small number of cases, with variable clinical manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AIM: To analyse a series of consecutive patients with facial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001052'>port-wine stains</z:hpo> referred to our Vascular Anomalies Centre to (1) stratify their clinical manifestations, and (2) identify the risks of neurological and/or ocular involvement according to topographic pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive patients with facial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001052'>port-wine stains</z:hpo> were taken from our Vascular Anomalies Database 1996-2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001052'>Port-wine stains</z:hpo> were topographically analysed and mapped to the sensory distribution of division(s) of the trigeminal nerve, cervical plexus, and dorsal rami of the spinal nerves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 158 patients were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Many of these patients had extension of their facial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001052'>port-wine stains</z:hpo> or additional separate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001052'>port-wine stains</z:hpo> on their scalp, neck, trunk or limbs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Involvement of adjacent mucosa, conjunctiva, underlying soft tissue and bone was common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients had associated neurological and/or ocular complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001052'>port-wine stains</z:hpo> in V1 distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Additional involvement of V2 and/or V3, and bilaterality were common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Seven of the nine patients (78%) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001052'>port-wine stains</z:hpo> affecting the entire V1 had neurological and/or ocular involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The risk of associated neurological and/or ocular disorder in a patient with partial or full V1 involvement was 26%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> being the most common manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The clinical stratification of facial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001052'>port-wine stains</z:hpo> provides a guide to patient counselling and therapeutic interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001052'>Port-wine stains</z:hpo> affecting the entire V1 distribution predict strongly for underlying neurological and/or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0851688" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ocular disorders</z:e> that require on-going ophthalmological surveillance and/or neurological management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Although the classical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome</z:e> encompasses a triad of clinical manifestations, incomplete forms are not uncommon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>This neuro-oculo-cutaneous syndrome is believed to be a result of vascular malformations of associated structures derived from the neuroectoderm (facial skin, eye, and parieto-occipital region of the brain and leptomeninges) during the first trimester </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>However, the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001052'>port-wine stains</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome</z:e> remains unclear </plain></SENT>
