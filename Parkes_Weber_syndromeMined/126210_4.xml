<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Judging from the structure of the involved chromosomes studied by banding and photometrical techniques, the loss of relatively large material of 21q is to be suggested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The meiotic segregation appears to depend on the involved 3p segment and not on the involved centromere of No. 21 as actually expected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The pedigree of the family shows 6 balanced carriers through 3 generations in addition to the propositus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The risk of having offspring with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Down's syndrome</z:e> obviously concerns female carriers in the first place, whereas the male carriers rather produce balanced carriers </plain></SENT>
