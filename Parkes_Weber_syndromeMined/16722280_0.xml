<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This case involves a possible complication of excessive <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> or rupture of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001028'>hemangiomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Problems and <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anesthetic</z:chebi> management of the patient are discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A 35-year-old man with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome</z:e> was to undergo teeth extraction and gingivectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001028'>Hemangiomas</z:hpo> covered his face and the inside of the oral cavity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We used intravenous conscious sedation with <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17045,29796">N2O</z:chebi>-O2 to reduce the patient's <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0086209" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">emotional stress</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It was previously determined that stress caused marked expansion of this patient's <z:hpo ids='HP_0001028'>hemangiomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Periodontal ligament injection was chosen as the local anesthesia technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Teeth were extracted without excessive <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> or rupture of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001028'>hemangiomas</z:hpo>, but the planned gingivectomies were cancelled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Deep sedation requiring airway manipulation should be avoided because there are possible difficulties in airway maintenance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Because this was an outpatient procedure, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> was selected as the sedative agent primarily because of its rapid <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and equally rapid recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Periodontal ligament injection with 2% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi> containing 1: 80,000 epinephrine was chosen for local anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Gingivectomy was cancelled because hemostasis was challenging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>As part of preoperative preparation, equipment for prompt intubation was available in case of rupture of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001028'>hemangiomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The typically seen elevation of blood pressure was suppressed under <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> sedation so that expansion of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001028'>hemangiomas</z:hpo> and significant intraoperative <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> was prevented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Periodontal ligament injection as a <z:chebi fb="39" ids="36333">local anesthetic</z:chebi> also prevented <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> from the injection site </plain></SENT>
