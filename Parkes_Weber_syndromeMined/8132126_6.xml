<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Each child was paired with an age- and IQ-matched control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were three unilateral right-hemisphere lesions and three unilateral left lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results showed that some of the skills relative to face processing were preserved (or recovered?), whereas other skills were severely impaired; the pattern varied from one child to another </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The existence of these dissociations shows that preservation of low-level visual processing together with exposure to the appropriate stimuli for several years is by no means sufficient for face processing skills to develop normally </plain></SENT>
