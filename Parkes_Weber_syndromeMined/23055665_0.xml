<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: A choroidal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001028'>hemangioma</z:hpo> is an uncommon <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1377916" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">benign vascular tumor</z:e> of the choroid that can be either circumscribed or diffuse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In our experience, diffuse choroidal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001028'>hemangiomas</z:hpo> in Asian patients often require multiple photodynamic therapy (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi>) treatment sessions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We here provide a case report of a 7-year-old boy with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome</z:e> who presented with diffuse choroidal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001028'>hemangioma</z:hpo> in the left eye </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five sessions of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> treatment were required over a period of 1 year and a final optical coherence tomogram 3 months later revealed resolution of subretinal fluid and the choroidal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001028'>hemangioma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Final visual acuity was 20/100 in the left eye with resolution of subretinal fluid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This case report illustrates that a single application of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> using standard published parameters was insufficient to achieve the destruction of the enlarged vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This experience is similar to previous Chinese reports on circumscribed choroidal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001028'>hemangiomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The decision for repeat treatment was based on subretinal fluid recurrence, rather than complete <z:mp ids='MP_0010537'>tumor regression</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our case report supports previous suggestions that larger dilated vessels in the vascular network of a choroidal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001028'>hemangioma</z:hpo> might affect the efficacy and selectivity of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53228">PDT</z:chebi> in treating the eyes of Asian patients - which may explain the need for multiple treatments </plain></SENT>
