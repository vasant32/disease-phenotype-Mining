<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS)</z:e>, medical treatment often fails to control intraocular pressure, thus requiring surgical intervention that may result in serious complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eighteen consecutive patients with SWS were reviewed retrospectively at the King Khaled Eye Specialist Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An intraocular pressure less than 20 mm Hg, plus stable optic nerve cup-to-disc ratio and corneal diameter (or visual fields where appropriate), were parameters chosen to indicate that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> was being controlled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>Glaucoma</z:hpo> was found in 15 of 18 patients (22 eyes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up time was 62 months (range, 12 to 148 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Medical treatment alone was successful in 5 patients (7 eyes); the remainder required surgical intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The initial surgical procedures included cyclocryotherapy, YAG laser goniotomy, surgical goniotomy, and trabeculotomy or trabeculectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eight eyes required subsequent surgery, 5 with Molteno or Ahmed implants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Early postoperative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0339434" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">choroidal effusion</z:e> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> occurred in 4 eyes and resolved spontaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0154905" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Hemorrhagic choroidal detachment</z:e> with total <z:hpo ids='HP_0000541'>retinal detachment</z:hpo> developed in 2 patients 3 to 5 months after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In 1 patient a recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0154904" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">serous choroidal detachment</z:e> after suture lysis was associated with total <z:hpo ids='HP_0000648'>optic atrophy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>Glaucoma</z:hpo> in SWS is common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Control of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> was successfully achieved with medical treatment in 7 of 22 eyes of our 15 SWS-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> patients, and we consider it the initial treatment of choice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Of the 15 eyes that required surgery, late postoperative complications resulted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>loss of vision</z:hpo> as a result of persistent postoperative hypotony in 3 eyes that underwent surgical procedures </plain></SENT>
