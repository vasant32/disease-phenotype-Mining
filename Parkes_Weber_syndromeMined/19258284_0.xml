<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Several hypotheses can be raised to explain this association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The coexistence of signs of both diseases in the same patient could be explained by abnormal neural crest development, and by mutually enhanced common altered pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mutation characterization of tuberous <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> complex and a better definition of the clinical and neuroimaging phenotypes could offer a crucial contribution to the etiopathogenetic mechanisms of these disorders </plain></SENT>
