<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The success of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> surgery is in part dependent upon identification of a lesion on MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In infants, the surgical epileptogenic substrates include focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002539'>cortical dysplasia</z:hpo> (FCD), <z:hpo ids='HP_0007206'>hemimegalencephaly</z:hpo>, tuberous <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> complex, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge Weber syndrome</z:e>, hypoxic-ischemic or cerebrovascular injury and low-grade <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity of MRI in identifying the epileptogenic substrate is influenced by the nature of the epileptogenic substrate, MRI technique and expertise of the interpreting physician </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The MRI features of some lesions such as FCD may differ in infants compared to children and adults; the white matter adjacent to FCD may demonstrate lower T2 and higher T1 signal in some infants due to premature myelination, while in others, the white matter demonstrates higher T2 or lower T1 signal due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011096'>demyelination</z:hpo>, dysmyelination or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002171'>gliosis</z:hpo>, similar to children and adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The appearances of some lesions, such as FCD, may change with time, due to brain maturation or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> related changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MRI for patients with localization-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096063" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intractable epilepsy</z:e> should have high-resolution, multiplanar and multisequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In infants, volumetric T1 and high-resolution T2 imaging are recommended </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>FLAIR and proton density sequences are less helpful in infants due to lack of myelin in the white matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The physician interpreting the scan should be familiar with the imaging appearances of epileptogenic substrates and may need to review the scan more than once if a lesion is not seen on initial inspection </plain></SENT>
