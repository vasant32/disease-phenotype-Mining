<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> these patients underwent a comprehensive presurgical evaluation, including extensive neurological history and examination, video-EEG monitoring of interictal EEG and habitual <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, CT and optimum <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a large subgroup of these patients a comprehensive neuro-psychological examination and interictal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31617">18FDG</z:chebi>-PET were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After the non-invasive phase of the presurgical evaluation, a bilateral carotid angiography and intracarotid <z:chebi fb="19" ids="2673">amytal</z:chebi> procedure was planned in 27 patients to establish hemispheric language dominance and bilateral memory function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After proper selection, 14 patients underwent invasive video-EEG monitoring with intracranial implantation of parenchymal and/or subdural electrodes to further document the area of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>From the initial group of 160 potential surgical candidates, 40 patients (20 M, 20 F) with mean age of 31 years (range: 2 months-55 years) and mean duration of uncontrolled <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> of 16 years (range: 2 months-47 years) eventually underwent a surgical procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>30/40 patients were on high dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">antiepileptic</z:chebi> polytherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Optimum <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> detected structural abnormalities, confined to a limited brain area, in 39 patients </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Structural abnormalities were most frequently located in the temporal lobe (n = 26) and the frontal lobe (n = 7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Video-EEG monitoring documented <z:hpo ids='HP_0002384'>complex partial seizures</z:hpo> in 32 patients with occasional secondary generalisation in 14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In most of these patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> could be subclassified as being of temporal lobe origin based on clinical and EEG criteria </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Standard or modified temporal lobectomy +/- hippocampectomy were the most commonly performed procedures (n = 26) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>In 5 patients complete lesionectomies were performed for epileptogenic structural lesions in and outside the temporal lobe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>In 2 patients only partial lesionectomies were possible; in 5 patients only biopsies could be performed </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Postsurgical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> control, after average follow-up of 20 months (range: 6-40 months), was excellent in 27 patients who became <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo>-free </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>In these patients <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">antiepileptic</z:chebi> therapy was tapered 2 years after surgery </plain></SENT>
