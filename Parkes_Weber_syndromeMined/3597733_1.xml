<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Serial developmental assessments were made using standardized clinical instruments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A preoperative assessment revealed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> development while postoperative assessments generally revealed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>delayed development</z:hpo> but with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rate of maturation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These results are discussed in relation to the issues of early functional specialization of the cerebral cortex and functional plasticity following early brain trauma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In particular, the evidence is interpreted as suggesting that the effect of left hemispherectomy early in life was effectively to delay <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> development, and that no specific impairment of either linguistic-communicative or visual-motor/visual-spatial development was apparent </plain></SENT>
