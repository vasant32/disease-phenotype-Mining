<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Four patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome</z:e> were studied using the non-invasive <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">Xenon</z:chebi>-133 inhalation technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> four patients had decreased regional cerebral blood flow in the area of their lesion, and in two patients who were subsequently tested with 5% carbon dioxide inhalation, impaired vasomotor reactivity was documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diminished regional cerebral blood flow is consistent with previously described nuclide flow studies which demonstrated a delay in the initial perfusion blush in the region of the abnormal vasculature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The focal decrease in blood flow was greatest in the most severely affected patient, but was also prominent in the two younger patients, both of whom have excellent neurologic function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These studies suggest that localized decrease in blood flow and vasomotor dysfunction in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome</z:e> can precede the occurrence of severe neurologic impairment and extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002059'>cerebral atrophy</z:hpo> and possibly be a major contributing factor in progressive dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A secondary observation was that the blood flow in the unaffected hemisphere was significantly greater in two children compared to the two adults and was similar to the age-related differences reported for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> children and adults </plain></SENT>
