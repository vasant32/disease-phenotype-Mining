<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty patients underwent hemispherectomy in our institution from 1987 to 2003, two presented with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber Syndrome (SWS)</z:e>, sixteen with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0393484" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Rasmussen's Syndrome</z:e> (RS), eight with established hemispheric lesions (EHL), and four with cortical development malformations (CDM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Six surgeons operated on three patients using anatomical hemispherectomies (AH), 11 patients using functional hemispherectomy (FH), and 16 patients employing hemispherotomy (HT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Surgical technique and causative pathology were studied independently as factors of morbidity in hemispherectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall mean surgical time was 11:50+/-3:20 h and increased proportionately in pathologies with larger hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Blood transfusion was particularly influenced by the approach adopted by our team of anesthesiologists, independently of technique or pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pathology was the most important factor related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> as two out of four patients with CDM needed ventriculoperitoneal shunt whilst none with EHL or SWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four patients undergoing HT and one FH presented residual bridges connecting the hemispheres, three were reoperated and are <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> free </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two patients with CDM did not improve their <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> worthwhile with surgery and other two (one with RS and other with CDM) were waiting a second procedure due to incomplete inter-hemispheric disconnection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Five patients presented <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and one died after developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025309" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">meningoencephalitis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Hemispherectomies are procedures where pathology and surgical technique interact narrowly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Therefore, in order to study surgical morbidity or outcome, both pathology and technique have to be analyzed independently </plain></SENT>
