<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We show a study in 121 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001052'>port-wine stain</z:hpo> (PWS) over the areas of trigeminal nerve sensory innervation, and we analyzed the relations between this distribution, sex and the neuro-ocular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The population included 68 women between 12 months and 73 years (mean, 23 years; standard deviation, 13.7 years) and 53 men between 12 months and 50 years (mean, 18 years; standard deviation, 12 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Chi-square test and Fisher test were performed in order to assess statistical significance of our results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Facial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001052'>port-wine stains</z:hpo> (PWS) were predominantly distributed over the area of innervation of the maxillary branch (V2) of the trigeminal nerve (88% of patients), either isolated or simultaneously involving ophthalmic (V1) and/or mandibular branch (V3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the unilateral PWS (86%), 10% were also extrafacially distributed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, bilateral PWS (14%) extended extrafacially in 53% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the number of patients with extrafacial PWS was increased among those with PWS over V3 (50%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>Glaucoma</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> were present in 23 (17%) and 17 (14%) patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of them PWS affected V1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among the 19 patients with bilateral PWS, nine of them developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> and five, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Epilepsy</z:e> was more frequent in men (26%) than in women (4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Statistical analysis showed: 1) the PWS is preferentially distributed over the maxillary branch of the trigeminal nerve, 2) bilateral PWS significantly increases the frequency of cutaneous extrafacial PWS, 3) the presence of PWS over the mandibular branch of trigeminal nerve carries a higher risk of cutaneous extrafacial presence of the <z:mp ids='MP_0002947'>angioma</z:mp>, 4) only those patients with PWS over the ophthalmic branch may develop <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> and/or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e>, 5) extrafacial PWS is associated with a higher frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo>, 6) men have a higher risk of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> than women </plain></SENT>
