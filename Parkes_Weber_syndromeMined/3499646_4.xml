<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The neurologic examination was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> during the attack-free period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The CT scan (fig. 1) and the M.R.I. study (fig. 2) only showed a moderate interhemispheric asymmetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The left internal carotid angiogram showed subtle anomalies of the venous system (fig. 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the neurologic manifestations ceased as soon as therapy by aspirin was initiated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">Positron</z:chebi> Emission Tomography (PET) study with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36932">oxygen 15</z:chebi> continuous inhalation technique was performed 7 months after the last attack in order to measure the regional Cerebral Blood Flow (rCBF), Oxygen Extraction Fraction (rOEF) and Oxygen Consumption (rCMRO2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Striking, statistically significant, alterations were observed in the left temporo-parieto-occipital area (fig. 4) consisting of a "misery perfusion" syndrome (rCBF = 28-38 ml/100 g/mn; rOEF = 0.64-0.80), without alteration in the rCMRO2 (Table) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A repeated PET study 12 months later was unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The association of local <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> oligemia and ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000329'>facial hemangioma</z:hpo>, ipsilateral cerebral hypotrophy and venous anomalies suggested the diagnosis of atypical leptomeningeal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002992,C1411989" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">angiomatosis</z:e> of the Sturge-Weber type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The importance and persistence of the hemodynamic alterations suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> oligemia and, hence, tissue <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> may participate in the pathogenesis of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo>-like attacks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Moreover, local circulatory stasis with thrombotic events may be implicated, as suggested by the apparent efficacy of aspirin </plain></SENT>
