<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: We present a retrospective analysis of medium and long-term results of trabeculectomy we have performed in our department as a first surgical procedure in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001087'>congenital glaucoma</z:hpo> between 1976 and 1995 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL-METHODS: Our study included 26 patients (46 eyes)(ratio M/F = 18/8) with congenital (&lt; or = 2 months = 4 patients including 3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> present at birth), infantile (&gt; 2 months, &lt; or = 24 months = 18 patients) and juvenile <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> (&gt; 24 months and &lt; or = 25 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 42 eyes, we performed a trabeculectomy as a first surgical procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A trabeculectomy was combined peroperatively with a trabeculotomy in <z:mp ids='MP_0005163'>one eye</z:mp> and a trabeculectomy was associated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35221">antimetabolites</z:chebi> in 3 eyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The trabeculodysgenesis was isolated in 38 eyes and was associated with a dysgenesis of the anterior segment in 4 eyes and a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge Weber syndrome</z:e> in 4 other cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean actual follow-up is 88.8 +/- 87.8 months (3 to 304 months) and is presently longer than 15 years in 6 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean age at the time of surgery was 24.4 months and was reduced to 4.9 months when we excluded the 4 patients with a juvenile <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An early postoperative objective refraction was performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Correcting lenses were prescribed and associated with occlusion if needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Beside tonometric, ophthalmoscopic and biometric monitoring, we investigated patient's final visual acuity, objective refraction, binocular vision, visual field when possible as well as their educational orientation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean 3 months (16.6 +/- 6.2 mm Hg), 12 months (16.1 +/- 6.9 mm Hg) and the mean final IOP (15.3 +/- 6.5 mm Hg) was significantly reduced compared with preoperative IOP (30.3 +/- 8.3 mm Hg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the last exam, IOP was &lt; or = 16 mm Hg in 33 eyes (71.7%) and &lt; or = 20 mm Hg in 41 eyes (89.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Among significant postoperative complications, we observed 2 uveal effusion syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The regression of the optic disc cupping was significant at every control by comparison with its preoperative evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>A medical adjunctive treatment was mandatory in 20 eyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Our 5 failures concerned eyes with multiple surgical procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>We had to perform one or more additional surgical procedures in 16 eyes (34.7%), knowing that neonatal forms and high myopic eyes have needed more additional surgical procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The mean period between different additional surgeries was varying in large amounts (mean period = 32 +/- 82 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>A filtration <z:mp ids='MP_0008854'>bleb</z:mp> was visible at the last examination in a minority of patients (n = 11 eyes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Final mean visual acuity was 0.5 +/- 0.4 (n = 35) and was &gt; 0.8 in 10 eyes of the 14 (7 patients) with an actual follow-up longer than 120 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In our experience, trabeculectomy may be considered as a valid and relatively safe first choice procedure in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001087'>congenital glaucoma</z:hpo>, although requiring a frequent adjunctive medical treatment and a relatively high incidence of additional surgical procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The large induced IOP reduction allows to maintain an excellent visual potential in combination with orthoptic treatment in a very significant number of cases </plain></SENT>
