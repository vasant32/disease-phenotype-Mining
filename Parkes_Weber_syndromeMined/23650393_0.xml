<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To investigate the impact of RASA1 mutations in the lymphatic system, we performed investigational near-infrared fluorescence lymphatic imaging and confirmatory radiographic lymphangiography in a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505,C0022739" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Parkes-Weber syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PKWS</z:e>) patient with suspected RASA1 mutations and correlated the lymphatic abnormalities against that imaged in an inducible Rasa1 knockout mouse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Whole-exome sequencing (WES) analysis and validation by Sanger sequencing of DNA from the patient and unaffected biological parents enabled us to identify an early-frameshift deletion in RASA1 that was shared with the father, who possessed a capillary stain but otherwise no overt disease phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Abnormal lymphatic vasculature was imaged in both affected and unaffected legs of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PKWS</z:e> subject that transported injected <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31696">indocyanine green</z:chebi> dye to the inguinal lymph node and drained atypically into the abdomen and into dermal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024248" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lymphocele</z:e>-like vesicles on the groin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Dermal lymphatic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> and dilated vessels were observed in Rasa1-deficient mice, with subsequent development of chylous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001541'>ascites</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>WES analyses did not identify potential gene modifiers that could explain the variability of penetrance between father and son </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, we conclude that the RASA1 mutation is responsible for the aberrant lymphatic architecture and functional abnormalities, as visualized in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PKWS</z:e> subject and in the animal model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our unique method to combine investigatory near-infrared fluorescence lymphatic imaging and WES for accurate phenoptyping and unbiased genotyping allows the study of molecular mechanisms of lymphatic involvement of hemovascular disorders </plain></SENT>
