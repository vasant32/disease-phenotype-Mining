<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Examination of the left lower limb revealed the presence of significant port-wine staining, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Duplex examination revealed a severely hypoplastic deep venous system with a tortuous, dilated, long saphenous vein, which was competent and responsible for a significant proportion of venous return from the left lower limb, thus confirming the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022739" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="KTS">Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient was counseled regarding the implications of the diagnosis and was treated conservatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The association between these two rare syndromes has been previously reported in the nonvascular literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We believe that features of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome</z:e> or other forms of mesodermal phakomatosis should alert a clinician to the presence of lower limb venous malformations, which will need to be investigated prior to embarking on what could be potentially detrimental venous surgery </plain></SENT>
