<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To report the outcomes of the 58 hemispherectomies performed at Johns Hopkins between 1968 and January 1996 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Charts were reviewed of the 58 hemispherectomies performed at Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions by the Pediatric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Epilepsy</z:e> Group during the years 1968 to 1996 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-seven operations were done for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0393484" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Rasmussen's syndrome</z:e>, 24 operations for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002539'>cortical dysplasias</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0007206'>hemimegalencephalies</z:hpo>, and 7 for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome</z:e> or other congenital vascular problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>Seizure</z:hpo> control alone did not seem to adequately describe the outcomes of the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, a score was constructed that included <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> frequency, motor disability, and intellectual handicap </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This burden of illness score better described the child's handicap before and after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> occurred in 4 out of 58 children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the 54 surviving children, 54% (29/54) are <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo>-free, 24% (13/54) have nonhandicapping <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, and 23% (12/54) have residual <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> that interfere to some extent with function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Reduction in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> was related to the etiology of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0438419" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">unilateral epilepsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Eighty-nine percent of children with Rasmussen's, 67% of those with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasias</z:mpath>, and 67% of the vascular group are <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo>-free, or have occasional, nonhandicapping <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> operations were considered by the parents and the physicians to have been successful in decreasing the burden of illness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In 44 the procedure was very successful, in 7 it was moderately successful, and in 3 it was minimally successful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Success was related to the etiology, and early surgery was preferable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Hemispherectomy can be a valuable procedure for relieving the burden of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, the burden of medication, and the general dysfunction in children with severe or progressive unilateral cortical disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Early hemispherectomy, although increasing the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0393484" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Rasmussen's syndrome</z:e>, relieves the burden of constant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> and allows the child to return to a more <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In children with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasias</z:mpath>, early surgery can allow the resumption of more <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> development </plain></SENT>
