<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up period was 13 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eyeball length and anterior chamber depth were measured by means of echooculometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Biometric data (echooculometry, corneal diameter, cup to disk ratio) were compared with psychophysic data (visual acuity, visual field) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Up to an axial length of 26 mm, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000545'>myopia</z:hpo> caused by elongation of the eyeball is compensated by the weak refractive power of the large cornea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In cases with an eyeball length of more than 27 mm, excessive <z:hpo ids='HP_0000545'>myopia</z:hpo> was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There is a linear correlation between corneal diameter and axial length of the eyeball </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases with an axial length of more than 27 mm only low vision was achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>From our results can be concluded that 27 mm is the "critical" eyeball length which carries a grave prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Due to the late (minimum 4 years) <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the disease, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the operated eyes with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge Weber syndrome</z:e> and juvenile <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> were in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> size </plain></SENT>
