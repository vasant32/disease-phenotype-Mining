<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty seven cases of infantile <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> and one case of St√ºrge-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505,C0022739,C0455717" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Weber syndrome</z:e>, with uncontrollable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> and severe behaviour disturbance, were subjected to hemispherectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Any evidence of a defect in the other hemisphere was a contraindication to operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In nine cases the left cerebral hemisphere was removed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Following the operation, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> and behavior disturbances were abolished in nearly <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In those with left hemispherectomy there was no speech disturbance before or after the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is postulated that at birth <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cerebral functions including consciousness, speech, and movement are bilaterally represented, but to unequal degrees </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With training and education these functions become more lateralized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, we can explain the greater plasticity of the brain in childhood </plain></SENT>
