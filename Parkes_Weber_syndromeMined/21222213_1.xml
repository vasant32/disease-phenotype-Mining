<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: A single-center experience with pediatric patients who underwent surgery for intractable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">rolandic epilepsy</z:e> was reviewed with the aim of identifying putative factors that could influence postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> outcome in this population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Clinical data of 48 patients under 18 years of age with diagnosis of intractable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376532" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BECTS">rolandic epilepsy</z:e> who underwent surgery from January 1996 to September 2009 were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients' mean age at surgery was 9.9 Â± 5.3 years; mean age at <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> was 3.9 years; mean <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> duration prior to surgery was 6 years; and mean follow-up was 5.1 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The most frequent etiologies were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002539'>cortical dysplasia</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0003354'>astrogliosis</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e>, tuberous <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> complex, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome</z:e>, which were observed in 20/48 (41.6%), 10/48 (20.8%), 10/48 (20.8%), 5/48 (10.4%), and 3/48 (6.2%) of the patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After surgery, 20 patients (41.6%) showed neurological deficits, which in turn recovered within no longer than 6 months after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>Seizure</z:hpo> outcome was classified as Engel class I in 29 (60.4%), Engel class II in 10 (20.8%), and Engel class III in 9 (18.8%) of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The factors significantly related with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> outcome were histological features (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> versus non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cases, p = 0.04) and lesion site (focal lesions versus non-focal lesions, p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Tailored resection of rolandic cortex for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096063" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intractable epilepsy</z:e> can be safely performed in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Accurate mapping of both functional cortex and epileptogenic areas may lead to improved <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> as well as focal lesions in hand and face motor areas are associated with good <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> outcome </plain></SENT>
