<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been hypothesized that somatic mosaic mutations disrupting vascular development cause both the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001052'>port-wine stains</z:hpo>, and the severity and extent of presentation are determined by the developmental time point at which the mutations occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To date, no such mutation has been identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed whole-genome sequencing of DNA from paired samples of visibly affected and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue from 3 persons with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We tested for the presence of a somatic mosaic mutation in 97 samples from 50 persons with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome</z:e>, a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001052'>port-wine stain</z:hpo>, or neither (controls), using amplicon sequencing and SNaPshot assays, and investigated the effects of the mutation on downstream signaling, using phosphorylation-specific antibodies for relevant effectors and a luciferase reporter assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified a nonsynonymous single-nucleotide variant (c.548G→A, p.Arg183Gln) in GNAQ in samples of affected tissue from 88% of the participants (23 of 26) with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome</z:e> and from 92% of the participants (12 of 13) with apparently nonsyndromic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001052'>port-wine stains</z:hpo>, but not in any of the samples of affected tissue from 4 participants with an unrelated cerebrovascular malformation or in any of the samples from the 6 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of the mutant allele in affected tissues ranged from 1.0 to 18.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Extracellular signal-regulated kinase activity was modestly increased during transgenic expression of mutant Gαq </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001052'>port-wine stains</z:hpo> are caused by a somatic activating mutation in GNAQ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This finding confirms a long-standing hypothesis </plain></SENT>
