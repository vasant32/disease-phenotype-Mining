<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirty-five consecutive children (age range: 30-153 months) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome</z:e> and unilateral brain involvement were enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Participants underwent cognitive assessment and interictal fluorodeoxyglucose PET scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Regression analyses tested whether a quadratic model best accounted for the relationship between extent of severe cortical hypometabolism and IQ, controlling for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A significant quadratic relationship was found between IQ and extent of severe (but not total) hypometabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>Seizure</z:hpo> variables also contributed significant variance to cognitive functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results suggest that intermediate size of severe hemispheric hypometabolism is associated with the worst cognitive outcomes, and small or absent lesions, with the best cognitive outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Children in whom a very large extent of the hemisphere is severely affected are likely to have relatively preserved cognitive function </plain></SENT>
