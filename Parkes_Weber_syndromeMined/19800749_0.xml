<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SWS without facial <z:hpo ids='HP_0003764'>nevus</z:hpo> was diagnosed based on calcification detected by CT and pial <z:mp ids='MP_0002947'>angioma</z:mp> detected by enhanced MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>His <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraine</z:hpo>-like <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> were preceded by left homonymous hemianopsia, which persisted for more than 60 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although homonymous hemianopsia disappeared with cessation of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> until 13 years of age, from age 14 years onward, this homonymous hemianopsia persisted after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> ended </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, reduced cerebral blood flow was seen in the right occipital area on SPECT </plain></SENT>
