<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to document the prevalence and morbidity of facial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> in 2 cohorts: group 1, surveyed patients registered in the SWS Foundation, and group 2, patients treated at our Vascular Anomalies Center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Predictive variables included age, sex, region of capillary stain, and ocular or cerebral involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Outcome variables were soft-tissue and bony <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo>, as well as the type of operative correction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In group 1, the response rate to our questionnaire was 29.3% (108/368) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Facial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> was documented in 60.0% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Soft-tissue <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> was present in 55.0%; the lip (81.0%) was the most commonly affected site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Skeletal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> was reported in 22% of patients; the maxilla (83.0%) was the most frequently overgrown bone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall, 23.0% of patients (36.5% with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo>) had an operation: 34.0% of patients with soft tissue <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> and 9.0% with skeletal enlargement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In group 2, 47 patients with SWS were treated at our center: 83% had facial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo>, either a localized cutaneous lesion (18.0%), soft-tissue enlargement (70.0%), or bony <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> (45.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>As in group 1, the lip (75.0%) and maxilla (94.0%) were the most commonly enlarged structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Operations were necessary for localized cutaneous lesions (86.0%), soft-tissue <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> (53.0%), or skeletal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> (11.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, facial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> is a major component of SWS; these patients should be counseled about the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> and about the types of possible operative correction </plain></SENT>
