<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Neurocutaneous syndromes</z:e> (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi>) are a group of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic disorders</z:e> that produce a variety of developmental <z:hpo ids='HP_0000951'>abnormalities of the skin</z:hpo> along with an increased risk of neurological complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cutaneous manifestations usually appear early in life and progress with time, but neurological features generally present at a later age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There is a paucity of data regarding the evolution of <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp> and their correlation with the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system involvement in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AIM: The primary objective was to track the course of <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp> in various forms of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi> in the pediatric age group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our secondary aim was to assess whether there was any predictive value of the lesions in relation to the neurological manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective longitudinal study was conducted at a tertiary care pediatric dermatology referral clinic of the Institute of Child Health, Kolkata, West Bengal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Children between the age group 0 and 12 years were included in the study on the basis of standard diagnostic criteria for different <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi>, during the period from March, 2000 to February, 2004, and each of the enrolled cases were followed up for a duration of six years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The study population comprised of 67 children (35 boys, 32 girls).The mean age of presentation was 33.8±27.8 months (range 10 days to 111 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The various forms of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi> observed was <z:hpo ids='HP_0001067'>neurofibromatosis</z:hpo> 1(NF1) (n=33), tuberous <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> complex (TSC) (n=23), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge Weber syndrome</z:e> (n=6), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001009'>telangiectasia</z:hpo> (n=2), PHACE syndrome (n=1), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021171" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">incontinentia pigmenti</z:e> (n=1), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022283" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">hypomelanosis of Ito</z:e> (n=1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The presentations were varied, ranging from predominantly cutaneous to primarily neurological, depending on the disease entity and age group concerned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was a significant increase in the number of café au lait macules (CALMs) with time (P=0.0002) in NF1, unlike that of hypopigmented macules of TSC (P=0.15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Statistically, no relation was documented between the evolution of <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp> and neurological manifestations in the major groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: As <z:chebi fb="7" ids="53203">NCS</z:chebi> is not an uncommon disease in children, it is always necessary to find out the subtle neurological signs, whenever we observe any case with cutaneous markers suggestive of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18022">NCS </z:chebi></plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In addition, it is a must to do a detailed dermatological examination in a child with central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system involvement, in the pediatric population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>However, the neurological course cannot be predicted from <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
