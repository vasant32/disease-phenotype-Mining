<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>WS is commonly associated with poor long-term outcome, especially in symptomatic cases, with development of other <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> types, impaired cognitive and psychosocial functioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of our study was to evaluate the efficacy of the control of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037769" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infantile spasms</z:e> using synthetic ACTH or vigabatrin in newly diagnosed cases and to correlate it with the underlyning causes, outcome and adverse effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The database of children with WS seen at the Neuropediatric Unit and followed at outpatient clinics from January 1, 1994 until December 31, 2003 were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of WS following the criteria of ILAE was made in 32 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Data were collected for 32 children (9 girls and 23 boys) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>According to the etiology, 5 (15.6%) were cryptogenic, and 1 (3.1%) was idiopathic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 26 (81.2%) symptomatic cases, hypoxic-ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> (69.2%) was the most common etiologic factor, followed by central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system anomaly including malformation of cortical development (11.5%), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge Weber syndrome</z:e> (3.8%), and chromosomal translocation with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Down syndrome</z:e> (11.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 65.1% of symptomatic cases birth occurred prematurely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean age at spasm <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> was 5.8 months, and mean age at diagnosis and treatment 7.2 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Between 1994 and 1996 synthetic ACTH was used for treatment of WS in 7 patients (1 cryptogenic and 6 symptomatic), spasm control was achieved in 6, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002521'>hypsarrhythmia</z:hpo> disappeared in 5, and vigabatrin was added after synthetic ACTH in 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In one child synthetic ACTH was stopped because of arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> children had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001578'>Cushing syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>After 1996, vigabatrin was administrated to 5 children with cryptogenic and 20 children with symptomatic WS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In 22/32 spasm control was achieved within 15 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Synthetic ACTH was added in 3 children with spasms and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002521'>hypsarrhythmia</z:hpo> disappeared in 1 child </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>There was no recurrence of WS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up in 27 children was 4.6 (0.5 to 9.9 years) whereas 5 were lost from follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Of 6/27 children with cryptogenic WS, 1 had idiopathic WS, 3 had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> psychomotor development and 2 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>psychomotor retardation</z:hpo>, without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic fits</z:e> and still receiving AED </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Of 21/27 children with symptomatic WS 76.2% had severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>psychomotor retardation</z:hpo>, 42.8% had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e>, 23.8% had intractable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic fits</z:e>, and 2 children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Down syndrome</z:e> were without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> and without AED </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0238111" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Lennox-Gastaut syndrome</z:e> developed in 14.2% (3/21 children); 1 of them died at the age of 3.5 years from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> gastric <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> during the administration of synthetic ACTH, and an other child died at the age of 5.5 years from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>respiratory insufficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The mortality rate was 7.4% (2/27 children) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The cryptogenic etiology is associated with a very low risk of poor outcome in WS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>In children with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> development and regular school performance an idiopathic etiology can be presumed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>The children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Down syndrome</z:e> had a relatively benign outcome with regard to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> control compared with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0393699" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">symptomatic infantile spasms</z:e> in the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>In symptomatic WS caused by hypoxic-ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> the outcome was linked with coexistence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0477371" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">other forms of epilepsy</z:e> and neurologic deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>The poor prognosis concerning intractable nature of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> and serious neurologic deficit is recorded in children with malformation of cortical development and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge Weber syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>The outcome of these children is determined by the brain damage other than by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> itself </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Regarding the treatment with synthetic ACTH or vigabatrin, the control of WS was the same for cryptogenic and symptomatic forms, one drug may be effective if the other drug fails </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Synthetic ACTH can have many side effects, even <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001123'>visual field defect</z:hpo> is associated with vigabatrin, but can be avoided with careful funduscopic follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Vigabatrin can be suggested as the first drug for WS; if spasms persist after 15 days with a dose of 150 mg/kg, synthetic ACTH should be considered </plain></SENT>
