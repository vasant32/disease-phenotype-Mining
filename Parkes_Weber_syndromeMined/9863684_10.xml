<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Language was mildly impaired but to the same extent as in IQ controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, visuospatial abilities were clearly worse than in IQ controls, and the most preserved visuospatial abilities seemed to be the less sophisticated ones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Non literal comprehension of language, a function generally attributed to the right hemisphere, was intact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This same pattern, that is, preservation of language and impairment of visuospatial abilities, also seems to occur in subjects who have undergone surgical removal of the right hemisphere; in other words, the cognitive pattern seems the same regardless of which hemisphere is removed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest that no matter which hemisphere is removed, functional reorganisation follows a hierarchical criterion which privileges the linguistic function, and the visuospatial functions most essential for independent survival </plain></SENT>
