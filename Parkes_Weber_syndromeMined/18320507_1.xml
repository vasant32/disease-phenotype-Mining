<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The exact cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> in SWS is poorly understood and difficult to treat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study is to investigate the ocular hemodynamics of children with SWS-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> using color Doppler imaging techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This is a prospective study of 10 pediatric patients with unilateral SWS-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Color Doppler imaging was used to measure the peak systolic velocity and the end diastolic velocity of both the ophthalmic and central <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> arteries in the glaucomatous eye compared to the fellow healthy eye </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty eyes of 10 children with SWS (6 boys) with unilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> were included in the prospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean age of the 10 participants was 5.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When compared to their contralateral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> eyes, the glaucomatous eyes had greater CDR (p&lt;0.001) and a myopic shift (p=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were found in the measurements of ocular blood flow velocities of the ophthalmic and central <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Vascular pathology has been proposed to play a role in SWS <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The authors did not find arterial retrobulbar blood flow differences between the glaucomatous and the fellow <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> eye </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Since the primary vascular anomaly in patients with SWS is in the venous plexus, a bigger prospective trial is warranted in order to better understand and treat children with SWS <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
