<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To study the future of vision and IOP in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001087'>congenital glaucoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: We studied 33 eyes from 20 separate patients divided into two groups: group one consisted of 19 eyes with isolated trabeculodysgenesis and group two 14 eyes associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber-Krabbe syndrome</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002992,C1411989" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">angiomatosis</z:e>, or Peters syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent filtering surgery between 1995 and 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We studied a number of different forms of surgery; visual acuity after <z:hpo ids='HP_0000646'>amblyopia</z:hpo> treatment (&gt; or =5/10, good; 4/10-2/10, average; &lt; or =1/10, poor), objective refraction, and intraocular pressure (&lt;16 mmHg, good; &gt; or =16 mmHg, poor) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found that 54.8% of the patients had visual acuity 5/10 or greater and 44.2% between 4 and the ability to perceive light </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Objective refraction was emmetropic in 19.4% (group 1, 60%; group 2, 40%), myopic in 53.8% (group 1, 28.5%; group 2, 71%), and hyperopic in 26.9% of cases (100%, group 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent surgery (45.5% deep sclerectomy and 54.5% trabeculectomy); 39.4% of the patients underwent more than one type of surgery (the number of operations is a prognosis factor for visual acuity) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>IOP was less than 19 mmHg in 87.9% of eyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Visual acuity, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034951" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">refractive errors</z:e>, and IOP depend on the type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001087'>congenital glaucoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Isolated trabeculodysgenesis seems to give a better prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: If early diagnosis and treatment occur, visual acuity that is 5/10 or less can be expected for more than 50% of patients; therefore their visual future seems to be better </plain></SENT>
