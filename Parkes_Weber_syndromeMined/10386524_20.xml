<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: We analyzed our experience over a 6-year period with early-childhood patients who had undergone <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> surgery, and investigated the surgical outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: We reviewed the medical records of 23 children, ages 0-3 years, who underwent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> surgery between 1991 and 1996 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty children had <z:hpo ids='HP_0007359'>partial seizures</z:hpo>; two had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037769" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infantile spasms</z:e>; and one had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002069'>generalized tonic-clonic seizures</z:hpo> at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> was 4.7 months, and the mean age at time of surgery was 15.3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 32 operations (21 focal cortical resections and 11 hemispherectomies) was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five of 12 children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> secondary to a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002269'>neuronal migration disorder</z:hpo> had reoperations, including three who ultimately underwent complete hemispherectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The pathology consisted of <z:hpo ids='HP_0007206'>hemimegalencephaly</z:hpo> in three patients, focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002539'>cortical dysplasia</z:hpo> (FCD) in eight, tuberous <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> in one, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS)</z:e> in five, infarction in two, low-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0009733'>glioma</z:hpo> (LGG) in three, and post-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019348" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herpes simplex</z:e> virus <z:hpo ids='HP_0002383'>encephalitis</z:hpo> (HSE) in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The follow-up period ranged from 1 to 6.5 years (mean, 3.2 years) from patients' last operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> outcome according to Engel's criteria was class I in 12 patients, class II in three, class III in six and class IV in two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>Seizure</z:hpo> outcomes after surgery were less favorable in infants with FCD than in those with SWS and LGG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>Seizure</z:hpo> outcome for the patients with hemispherectomies was excellent, compared with those who had focal cortical resections </plain></SENT>
