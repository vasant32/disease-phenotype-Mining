<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To assess the size of the choroid plexus in young children with unilateral and bilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Subjects included 15 children 4 years old or younger with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eleven cases were unilateral and four were bilateral </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Unilateral or bilateral involvement was determined by the distribution of abnormal leptomeningeal enhancement on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The diameters of the choroid plexus were measured on contrast-enhanced axial <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The choroid plexus of the affected and unaffected sides in these cases were compared with those of 15 age-matched children without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome</z:e> who were being examined for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Our results show a wide variation in the size of the choroid plexus in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome</z:e>; however, plexus associated with a hemisphere affected by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome</z:e> were significantly larger than those on the unaffected side and in the age-matched control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The size of the choroid plexus was positively correlated with the extent of leptomeningeal involvement as demonstrated by abnormal contrast enhancement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The choroid plexus is enlarged early in the course of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome</z:e> in both unilateral and bilateral cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There is a positive correlation between choroid plexus size and extent of leptomeningeal involvement in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
