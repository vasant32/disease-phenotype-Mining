<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An Internet-based questionnaire was completed anonymously by 104 Sturge-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505,C0022739,C0455717" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Weber syndrome</z:e> patients, 74 of whom reported experiencing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraines</z:hpo> (median age, 25 years; range, 3-64 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sixteen (22%) subjects self-reported trying triptans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five of 12 (42%) describing triptan response believed they were very efficacious (median time of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of 26 minutes), compared to 13 of 65 (20%) using over-the-counter <z:chebi fb="29" ids="35480">analgesics</z:chebi> (P = .08) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eighty-eight percent (14/16) of triptan users self-reported that when they do not use medications, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraines</z:hpo> had a moderate to severe impact on their quality of life; however, while taking triptans, only 50% (7/14) of users reported such an impact (P = .03) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The small sample size precludes any safety analysis, however, and future prospective trials of both treatment options are needed </plain></SENT>
