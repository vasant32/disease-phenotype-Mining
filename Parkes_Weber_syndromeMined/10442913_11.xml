<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective noncomparative case series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: Ten eyes of nine patients were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with SWS who underwent primary combined trabeculotomy-trabeculectomy from January 1993 through December 1996 were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One patient had bilateral surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: Primary combined trabeculotomy-trabeculectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Pre- and postoperative intraocular pressures (IOPs), corneal clarity and diameters, visual acuities, success rate, <z:mp ids='MP_0008854'>bleb</z:mp> characteristics, time of surgical failure (if any), and complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean preoperative IOP was 28.2 mmHg +/- 7.35 mmHg with medication (mean, 1.2 +/- 0.6; range, 0-2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean postoperative IOP was 11.8 mmHg +/- 1.8 mmHg, with a mean percent reduction of 55.8 +/- 12.6 in IOP (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> eyes maintained a postoperative IOP &lt; 16 mmHg without medication over a mean follow-up of 27.6 +/- 16.4 months (range, 12-64 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> corneal clarity was achieved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> eight eyes that had corneal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were no significant intraoperative complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Postoperatively, one patient developed a <z:hpo ids='HP_0000594'>shallow anterior chamber</z:hpo> with choroidal detachment, which was successfully managed conservatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Primary combined trabeculotomy-trabeculectomy is safe, effective, and sufficiently predictable to be considered the first choice of surgical treatment in early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> associated with SWS </plain></SENT>
