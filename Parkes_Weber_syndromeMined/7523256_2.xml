<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The case of a 20-year-old woman with a left-sided <z:hpo ids='HP_0000329'>facial hemangioma</z:hpo> and a homolateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> is reported, complete with the histology of a trabeculectomy specimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Her left eye had an episcleral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001028'>hemangioma</z:hpo> and goniodysgenetic features in the anterior chamber angle, while the intraocular pressure was measured to be 45 mmHg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The left optic disc showed a large cupping and the left visual field was constricted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The right eye had no glaucomatous changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Histological examination of the trabeculectomy specimen by both light and electron microscopy showed multiple congenital anomalies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a cluster of blood vessels in the trabecular meshwork </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Abnormal accumulations of fine granular extracellular matrixes were observed in both the juxtacanalicular connective tissue and around the vascular structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The lumen of <z:mp ids='MP_0005204'>Schlemm's canal</z:mp> was subdivided into three or four parts with few giant vacuole structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The endothelial cells lining the inner wall of <z:mp ids='MP_0005204'>Schlemm's canal</z:mp> contained a well-formed basal lamina with many villi projecting into the lumen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the multiple anomalies observed in the trabecular tissue may contribute to the manifestation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
