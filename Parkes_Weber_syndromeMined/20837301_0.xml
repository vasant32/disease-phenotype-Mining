<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These issues can result in frequent illnesses or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001883" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">airway obstruction</z:e>, affecting patients' neurologic status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with definite brain involvement who reported potential ear, nose, and throat issues on intake questionnaires underwent retrospective reviews of their medical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We examined the relationships between these issues, secondary surgical interventions, and patients' neurologic status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The most common complaints involved the sinuses and frequent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0699744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ear infections</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six patients underwent placement of ear tubes, leading to improvements in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraines</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002401'>stroke-like episodes</z:hpo> in one patient, and improved <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> control in four others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002870'>Obstructive sleep apnea</z:hpo> was confirmed in three patients who underwent sleep studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Tonsil or adenoid removal occurred in another three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Surgery resulted in marked improvements regarding excessive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002307'>drooling</z:hpo>, daytime sleepiness, and breathing problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that ear, nose, and throat problems occur frequently in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber Syndrome</z:e>, and when repeated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0699744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ear infections</z:e> are associated with uncontrolled <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, early placement of ear tubes may be beneficial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, patients with facial tissue <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> may be at risk for obstructive sleepÂ <z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apnea</z:hpo>, and should be appropriately evaluated </plain></SENT>
