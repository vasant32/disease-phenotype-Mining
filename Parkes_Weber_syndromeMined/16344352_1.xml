<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: We retrospectively reviewed medical records in a group of 28 patients with SWS, noting the main features of SWS and accompanying unexpected abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also conducted a literature review of abnormalities associated with SWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-eight medical records of patients with SWS were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of this number, we found 8 (29%, 2 female) patients who manifested other abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our review of the literature uncovered 15 additional cases with associated abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We hypothesize that the abnormalities associated with SWS suggest testable insights regarding pathogenesis and that chromosome 17p1-p13 may be a candidate region for genes involved with SWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We also propose that some patients with SWS may have disorders of cholesterol biosynthesis or carbohydrate glycosylation </plain></SENT>
