<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The natural course of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS)</z:e> is poorly understood, although neurological symptoms are often progressive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To track longitudinal changes in brain <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism measured with <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography (PET) and their relation to clinical changes during the early course of SWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fourteen children (age 3 months to 3.9 years at enrollment) with SWS and unilateral leptomeningeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002947'>angioma</z:mp> underwent two consecutive <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism PET scans with a mean follow-up time of 1.2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Longitudinal changes of the extent of cortical <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> hypometabolism on the <z:mp ids='MP_0002947'>angioma</z:mp> side were measured and correlated with age, clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> frequency and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: An increase in the size of the hypometabolic cortex was seen in 6 children, coinciding with an age-related increase in cortical <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism measured in unaffected contralateral cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These 6 patients were younger both at the initial (mean age 0.75 vs. 2.8 years; p&lt;0.001) and the second scan (mean age 1.8 vs. 4.2 years; p=0.001) than those with no change in the extent of hypometabolic cortex (n=6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The area of cortical hypometabolism decreased in the two remaining children, and this was associated with resolution of an initial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> in one of them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>Seizure</z:hpo> frequency between the two scans was higher in children who showed progressive enlargement of cortical hypometabolism, as compared to those with no progression (p=0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In SWS, detrimental metabolic changes occur before 3 years of age coinciding with a sharp increase of developmentally regulated cerebral metabolic demand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Progressive hypometabolism is associated with high <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> frequency in these children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, <z:mp ids='MP_0005266'>metabolic abnormalities</z:mp> may remain limited or even partially recover later in some children with well-controlled <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Metabolic recovery accompanied by neurological improvement suggests a window for therapeutic intervention in children with unilateral SWS </plain></SENT>
