<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: 50 children (50 eyes) with secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> (aphakic, posttraumatic, in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome</z:e> and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000526'>aniridia</z:hpo>) which was uncontrolled with medical and surgical therapy or the surgery had a high risk of postoperative complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients diode laser transscleral cyclophotocoagulation has been performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After one month intraocular pressure was reduced (with or without medical treatment) below 23 mm Hg in 40% of patients and after 6 months in 68% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The worst results were observed in posttraumatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Diode laser transscleral cyclophotocoagulation is a safe and effective method of secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> therapy in children uncontrolled with other methods of medical and surgical therapy or when the surgery has a high risk of postoperative complications </plain></SENT>
