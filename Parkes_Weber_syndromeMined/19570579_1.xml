<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS)</z:e> may present with neurological symptoms or neurocognitive deficits that cannot always be explained by the supratentorial findings seen on conventional MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Purpose of our study was to determine (a) what percentage of children with SWS have simultaneous supra- and infratentorial involvement and (b) what kind of infratentorial lesions are seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, we used DWI data to measure the <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>-values of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> appearing white matter (NAWM) to rule out impaired or delayed white matter maturation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifteen SWS patients who underwent MRI/DWI between January 2000 and August 2008 were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Images were retrospectively reviewed by two experienced pediatric neuroradiologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> measurements of the NAWM were performed at multiple locations within the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>-values were compared with normative data and with 18 matched <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls from our hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Infratentorial involvement was seen in six out of 15 patients (40%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0742035" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebellar lesions</z:e> included leptomeningeal enhancement, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> and developmental venous anomaly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>-values were increased in the NAWM of the frontal, parietal and occipital lobes of both hemispheres and in the pons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>-values of the cerebellar white matter were increased in six out of eight affected cerebellar lobes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Infratentorial involvement of SWS is more frequently than previously thought </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> analysis of the NAWM reveals impaired/altered white matter maturation distant from the area of leptomeningeal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002992,C1411989" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">angiomatosis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This may explain neurocognitive deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> analysis of the NAWM may serve as biomarker of tissue injury and therefore guide treatment options </plain></SENT>
