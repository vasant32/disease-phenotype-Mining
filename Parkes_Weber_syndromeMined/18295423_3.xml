<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To utilize diffusion tensor tractography and evaluate the integrity of the corticospinal tract in children with unilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS)</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixteen children (age: 1.5-12.3 years) with SWS involving one hemisphere and varying degrees of motor deficit, underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as part of a prospective clinical research study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was obtained and fiber tracking of the corticospinal tract was performed yielding average FA and <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> values along the pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These values were compared between the two hemispheres (affected vs. unaffected) and also correlated with the degree of motor deficits, after correction for age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Corticospinal tract FA values on the side of the affected hemisphere were lower (p=0.008) and <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> values were higher (p=0.011) compared to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, FA and <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> values on the side of the <z:mp ids='MP_0002947'>angioma</z:mp> did not show the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> age-related variations, which the contralateral corticospinal pathway values did demonstrate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although none of the patients had severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo>, those with moderate motor deficit had increased <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> values, as compared to those with mild (p=0.009) or no motor deficit (p=0.045) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: MRI with DTI shows <z:hpo ids='HP_0002492'>abnormalities of the corticospinal tract</z:hpo> in children with SWS even before severe motor impairment develops </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, DTI can be a clinically useful method to evaluate the integrity of the corticospinal tract in young children who are at risk for progressive motor dysfunction </plain></SENT>
