<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cutaneous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025209" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">melanosis</z:e> extended to more than 50 p </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>100 of the body surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hands, feet and the face were spared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001000'>abnormal pigmentation</z:hpo> of the eyes involved the sclerae bilaterally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clinically, the cutaneous hypermelanoses most likely represented a widespread aberrant <z:hpo ids='HP_0100814'>mongolian spot</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Histological study of the hyperpigmented skin revealed dermal melanocytes in the superficial and mid-dermis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ultrastructural study showed that most of the dermal melanocytes were loaded with mature melanosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> development stages of melanosomes were observed in some of them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Average melanosomal size in the dermal melanocytes was slightly increased when compared to that of melanosomes in epidermal keratinocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>From this case and from a review of the literature, the authors suggest that the association between the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome</z:e> and disturbances of the melanin <z:hpo ids='HP_0001000'>pigmentation</z:hpo> of the skin and eye is probably not coincidental </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>An embryologic abnormality, affecting both the neural crest (from where melanoblasts originate) and the primary vascular plexus may explain such an association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Various disorders, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0009920'>nevus of Ota</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001052'>nevus Flammeus</z:hpo>, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome</z:e> associated with ocular and cutaneous pigmentary abnormalities and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome</z:e> in the complete or incomplete forms, may represent the clinical picture of the same embryologic disturbance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The clinical picture might be related to the time at which it acts, the receptivity of the various structures and their level of differentiation </plain></SENT>
