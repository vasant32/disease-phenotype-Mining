<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, in the case examined by us, various types of vascular malformations formed in different periods of the ontogenic development were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They were seen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> parts of the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system and clinically mimicked multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the background of generalized ischemic lesions of the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>, certain kinds of vascular malformations were seen: cavernous or fetallike vessels within meninges, superficially located capillary <z:mp ids='MP_0002947'>angioma</z:mp> penetrating into the brain and spinal cord white matter, and arterio-venous pathological conglomerates forming meningeal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002992,C1411989" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">angiomatosis</z:e> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no disturbances in expression of angiopoietin, platelet-derived growth factor, transforming growth factor beta and vascular endothelial growth factor receptors Tie-1/2, PDGFR-alpha/beta, endoglin and Flk-1, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The presence of various types of pathological vessels originating from different ontogenic periods indicates remittent or prolonged influence of teratogenic factor(s) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> periods of fetal vessel development </plain></SENT>
