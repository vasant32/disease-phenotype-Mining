<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, studies reporting long-term longitudinal outcomes after subhemispheric disconnective <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> surgery are still limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Methods The authors conducted a retrospective review of prospectively collected data of 10 children who underwent temporoparietooccipital (TPO) disconnective surgery at the Vienna Pediatric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Epilepsy</z:e> Center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results There were 3 males and 7 females (median age 8.7 years; range 4.2-22.1 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The affected hemisphere was the left in 3 patients and the right in 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patients' median age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> was 3.0 years (range 0.2-8.3 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median duration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> before surgery was 5.2 years (range 1.3-17.2 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The underlying pathology was TPO malformation of cortical development in 5 patients, and venous infarction, posterior hemispheric quadrant <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome</z:e>, cortical involvement of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002171'>gliosis</z:hpo> after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1263885" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cerebral tumor</z:e> treatment in 1 each </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 6 children, a pure TPO disconnection was performed; in 2 patients, the temporal lobe was resected and parietooccipital disconnection was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The 2 remaining patients had had previous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> surgery that was extended to a TPO disconnection: disconnection of the occipital lobe (n = 1) and resection of the temporal lobe (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The authors encountered no complications while performing surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No patient needed blood replacement therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No patient developed CSF disturbances that warranted treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Nine of 10 patients are currently <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> free since surgery (Wieser Class 1a) at a median follow-up time of 2.1 years (range 4 months to 8.1 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Conclusions Temporoparietooccipital disconnection is a safe and effective motor-sparing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> surgery in selected cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Technical adjuncts facilitate a better intraoperative visualization and orientation, thereby enabling a less invasive approach than previously suggested </plain></SENT>
