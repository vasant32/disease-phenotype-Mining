<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS)</z:e> is frequently associated with neurologic complications such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, so diagnosing this condition has important implications for patient management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to report unusual neuroimaging findings in patients with facial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001052'>port-wine stain</z:hpo> (PWS) and clinically suspected SWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cranial <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging was reviewed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> children with facial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001052'>port-wine stain</z:hpo> (PWS) involving the upper face and eyelids who were referred to Great Ormond Street Hospital between 2003 and 2007 for investigation of suspected SWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were excluded from further analysis if the imaging findings were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> on initial and subsequent scans and the subject remained free of neurologic disease, or if the imaging showed the well-recognized pattern of exclusively supratentorial pial enhancement representing the pial <z:mp ids='MP_0002947'>angioma</z:mp> of SWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For the remaining patients, the neurologic, dermatologic, and ophthalmologic records were examined and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> available imaging was reviewed by a neuroradiologist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We documented the presence and distribution of pial enhancement; corroborative features of SWS, such as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath>, calcification, choroid plexus changes, and ocular abnormalities; and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other intracranial abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 62 patients referred for assessment, imaging findings were considered typical of SWS in 32 (52%) and were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or showed abnormalities attributable to an unrelated pathology in 20 (32%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the remaining 10 patients, in 7 (11%), there was evidence of a pial <z:mp ids='MP_0002947'>angioma</z:mp> in an unusual distribution involving infratentorial structures, with the <z:mp ids='MP_0002947'>angioma</z:mp> in 1 patient being diagnosed at postmortem only; in 2 (3%), there were imaging abnormalities with some features in common with typical SWS, such as subcortical calcification, but with no evidence of pial enhancement; in 1 (1.6%), the initial <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging finding was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, but repeat imaging subsequently revealed pial enhancement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Involvement of infratentorial structures is common but may be relatively subtle and should be actively sought </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cases in which there are certain patterns of imaging abnormalities but an apparent absence of supratentorial pial enhancement on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging may represent formes frustes of SWS; visualization of pial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002992,C1411989" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">angiomatosis</z:e> may also be delayed until later in childhood than expected </plain></SENT>
