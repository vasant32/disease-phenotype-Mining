<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data from 43 patients and 68 eyes who were operated in our department between 1990 and 2002 were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This retrospective trial included <z:hpo ids='HP_0008007'>primary congenital glaucoma</z:hpo> (n=36), and secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> (n=7) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265341" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Rieger</z:e>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1280768" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Axenfeld syndrome</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge Weber syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intraocular pressure (IOP), axial length of the eyeball, visual acuity, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034951" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">refractive errors</z:e> and orthoptic status were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The age of patients at the first surgery was 6.0 +/- 5.3 months (range 0.7 to 28.0 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean period of follow-up was 57.3 +/- 36.8 months (6.0-161.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean number of surgical procedures performed on <z:mp ids='MP_0005163'>one eye</z:mp> was 2.5 +/- 2.4 procedures (1-11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean IOP before the first surgery was 31.0 +/- 7.9 mmHg (17.5-52.0), and was 15.0 +/- 3.9 mmHg (7.0-28.0) at the last visit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>49 eyes (72.1%) did not need any further medical treatment after the last surgical procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The IOP was 18 mmHg or lower without medication in 29 eyes (42.6%) after just one surgical procedure (21 trabeculotomy, 8 combined trabeculotomy/trabeculectomy with or without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27504">mitomycin-C</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At the first examination, the mean axial length of the eyeball was 22.6 +/- 1.8 mm (the mean <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> value at this age is 20.3 +/- 0.7 mm), and was 24.4 +/- 2.0 mm at the last visit (the mean <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> value at this age is 22.2 +/- 0.6 mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The best corrected visual acuity at the last visit was 0.25 +/- 4.6 lines; the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range of visual acuity at this age is from 0.4 +/- 4.0 lines to 0.8 +/- 3.0 lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Visual acuity was 0.32 or more in 53.0% of the eyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Visual acuity was lower than 0.1 in only 15.2% of the eyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000545'>Myopia</z:hpo> was present in 57.4% of the eyes with a mean spherical equivalent of -6.1 +/-3.9 dioptres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>15 patients (34.9%) developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000486'>strabismus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>22 patients (51.2%) were treated with part-time occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Binocular function as assessed with the Lang-1 test was positive in 17 of 30 patients (56.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although a good long-term IOP-control can often be achieved in childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo>, the visual acuity remains below the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range in most cases despite close orthoptic follow-up </plain></SENT>
