<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Children with advanced SWS showed markedly depressed ICMRGIc in the anatomically affected cerebral hemisphere in a distribution that extended beyond the abnormalities depicted on computed tomography scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In two infants with SWS and recent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, interictal PET revealed a paradoxical pattern of increased ICMRGIc in the cerebral cortex of the anatomically affected hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In one of these infants, ICMRGIc was also increased in the contralateral cerebellum, suggesting activation of the cortico-ponto-cerebellar circuitry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subsequent PET (28 months later) in this child revealed the typical ICMRGIc pattern seen in advanced SWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further study of this transient ICMRGIc increase may be important in disclosing the pathogenesis of unilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0007313'>cerebral degeneration</z:hpo> in SWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In neurologically asymptomatic children with the facial stigmata of SWS and in children with early SWS, PET provides a sensitive measure of the extent and degree of cerebral metabolic impairment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Serial PET studies in children with SWS can be used to assess disease progression and, together with computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, may be useful in the selection of suitable candidates for cerebral hemispherectomy or focal cortical resection </plain></SENT>
