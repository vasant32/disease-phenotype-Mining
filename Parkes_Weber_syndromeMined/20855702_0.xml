<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: A new pathophysiologic mechanism has been proposed that indicates that periorbital <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0235752" disease_type="Neoplastic Process;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">port-wine birthmarks</z:e> (PWBs) serve as alternate collateral blood passageways when orbital venous drainage is impaired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The occlusion of such collateral venous channels could, therefore, potentially exacerbate impaired ocular venous flow and trigger the development or worsening of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated to what extent a single application of laser therapy, which occludes only the most superficial portions of a facial PWB, might affect intraocular pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pressures before and after laser treatment were measured to determine pressure difference in 15 patients receiving laser treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>OBSERVATIONS: The greatest pressure differences were observed in patients with a PWB closest to the eye (P = .02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Posttreatment pressures were significantly decreased, relative to pretreatment pressures, only in patients with a PWB on the eyelid compared with patients with a facial PWB not near the eyes (2.33 vs 0.75 mm Hg; P = .004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No correlation was found between change in pressure and patient age, PWB size, or number of previous treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A single laser application to a PWB does not appear to show a clinically relevant change in intraocular pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further study is needed longitudinally in a broad range of patients </plain></SENT>
