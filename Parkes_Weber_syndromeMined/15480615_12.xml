<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Typical imaging findings using MRI or CT are superficial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002514'>cerebral calcification</z:hpo>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> and leptomeningeal enhancement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We present a neonate diagnosed with SWS because of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001052'>port-wine stain</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the absence of neurological symptoms the first MRI was performed when he was 4 months old, and follow-up MRI studies were performed after his first <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> at the age of 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MRI was performed using standard sequences before and after administration of IV <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The initial conventional MRI sequences did not demonstrate any abnormality, but BOLD venography identified leptomeningeal internal veins </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At this time there were the first signs of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> and CT showed marginal calcifications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This report demonstrates that high-resolution BOLD <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venography allows early diagnosis of venous anomalies in SWS, making early therapeutic intervention possible </plain></SENT>
