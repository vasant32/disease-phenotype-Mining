<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Many infants born with a facial port-wine (PW) birthmark will not develop brain involvement of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS)</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have shown asymmetry in quantitative EEG (qEEG) correlates with degree of clinical impairment in children and adults with known SWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hope to determine if quantitative qEEG can be used as a method to predict which infants are most likely to develop SWS brain involvement on MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The current study looks at the ability of qEEG to differentiate between infants with radiographically demonstrated SWS and those without </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We first performed an observational study of qEEG results on eight infants with facial PW birthmark (four had SWS brain involvement) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We recorded standard clinical EEGs and then derived a measure of asymmetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We subsequently validated this threshold through a study of an additional nine infants with PW birthmark (five with SWS brain involvement) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Quantitative EEG correctly identified infants with SWS brain involvement in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases in the Validation cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This technique was at least as good as a pediatric electroencephalographer with extensive experience reading SWS EEGs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the ability for qEEG to discriminate between those infants with SWS brain involvement and those with neurologically asymptomatic PW birthmark </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>SIGNIFICANCE: This study represents an important step toward the development of a qEEG technique able to predict which infants with PW birthmark will develop SWS brain involvement </plain></SENT>
