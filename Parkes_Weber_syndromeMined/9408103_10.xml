<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Functional cerebral imaging PET and SPECT have shown hypometabolism and hypoperfusion in the area of vascular malformation in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, data are scarce in infants and do not exist in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber disease</z:e> without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The pattern of perfusion during the first two years of life was studied including patients before the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty two infants with later confirmed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber disease</z:e> underwent SPECT examination using TOMOMATIC 564 (Medimatic) and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi>-133 at ages ranging from 8 days to 25 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twelve had never had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> before SPECT and seven underwent a second SPECT a mean seven months later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow (CBF) was measured in the whole hemisphere and in the part of the cortex involved in the vascular malformation on both sides as well as a "pathological to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>" index for the hemisphere and vascular malformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These values were compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> age paired values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with controls, CBF and the indices in the hemisphere and vascular malformation were significantly decreased in patients who already had had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> before SPECT, whereas they were significantly increased in 75% of the patients who had never had any <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On second SPECT, the indices were decreased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, including the four who still remained non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: SPECT therefore detects CBF asymmetry in infants with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber disease</z:e>, which tends to shift with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The cortex involved in the vascular malformation is hyperperfused during the first year of life before first <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The classic hypoperfusion appears after one year of age, even in non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
