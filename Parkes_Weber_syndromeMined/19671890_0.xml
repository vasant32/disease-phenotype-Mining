<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The advantages of this therapy include milder adverse effects without limits for maximal <z:chebi fb="1" ids="8069">phenobarbital</z:chebi> levels or doses during the initial phase of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, little is known about the safety of continuing the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We describe an infant with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096063" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intractable epilepsy</z:e> associated with bilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome</z:e> who became <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009421" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">comatose</z:e> after 1(2/3) months of high-dose <z:chebi fb="1" ids="8069">phenobarbital</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient regained consciousness as serum <z:chebi fb="1" ids="8069">phenobarbital</z:chebi> concentration decreased to below 40 microg/mL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The progression and recovery were also documented by electroencephalogram and brainstem auditory evoked potentials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The present case suggests that prolonged high-dose <z:chebi fb="1" ids="8069">phenobarbital</z:chebi> therapy may cause cerebral and brainstem dysfunction in patients with severe cerebrovascular diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The underlying baseline metabolic and perfusion deficit related to the disease can precipitate the neurological complication during long-term high-dose <z:chebi fb="1" ids="8069">phenobarbital</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
