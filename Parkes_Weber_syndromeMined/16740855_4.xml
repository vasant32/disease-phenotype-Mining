<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome</z:e> is characterized by leptomeningeal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002992,C1411989" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">angiomatosis</z:e> and a facial <z:hpo ids='HP_0003764'>naevus</z:hpo> that is usually unilateral </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging is the cornerstone of confirming the disease and judging the extent of the abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It has been shown, however, that brain perfusion abnormalities on nuclear medicine imaging often are more extensive than the abnormal leptomeningeal enhancement on magnetic resonance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this article, we assess the utility of magnetic resonance perfusion in demonstrating perfusion abnormalities in pediatric cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Magnetic resonance perfusion studies were performed on 7 consecutive children who presented to our department with clinically suspected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The extent of time to peak abnormality on dynamic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi> bolus magnetic resonance perfusion imaging was compared with the extent of leptomeningeal enhancement and the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002624'>venous abnormalities</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Good magnetic resonance perfusion data were obtained in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 7 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Perfusion abnormalities were closely anatomically related to meningeal enhancement on postcontrast T1-weighted imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, perfusion abnormalities were found consistently in the vicinity of developmental venous anomalies that were present in 4 of 7 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 1 child, there was a perfusion deficit in the cerebellar lobe contralateral to the leptomeningeal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002992,C1411989" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">angiomatosis</z:e>, consistent with crossed cerebellar diaschisis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Magnetic resonance perfusion is a sensitive indicator of perfusion abnormalities in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome</z:e> and can be performed easily at the same time as the diagnostic scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance perfusion imaging therefore is useful in the assessment of this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This approach has the extra advantage of correlating the perfusion abnormalities with the high-resolution imaging that is provided from magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
