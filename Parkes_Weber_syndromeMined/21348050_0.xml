<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>About 30% of affected individuals also have associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformations</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp>) and/or arterio-venous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistulas</z:mpath> (AFVs), fast-flow vascular anomalies that typically arise in the skin, muscle, bone, spine, and brain; life-threatening complications of these lesions can include <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo>, and/or neurologic consequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Symptoms from intracranial <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp>/AVFs seem to occur early in life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Several individuals with a RASA1 mutation have the clinical diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505,C0022739" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Parkes Weber syndrome</z:e> (multiple micro-AVFs associated with a cutaneous capillary stain and excessive soft tissue and skeletal growth of an affected limb) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: The diagnosis is based on clinical findings and molecular genetic testing of RASA1, the only gene in which mutations are associated with RASA1-related disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Such testing is available on a clinical basis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: for capillary malformations that are of cosmetic concern, referral to a dermatologist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp> and AVFs, the risks and benefits of intervention (embolization vs. surgery) must be considered, usually with input from a multi-disciplinary team (e.g., specialists in interventional radiology, neurosurgery, surgery, cardiology, and dermatology) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0684338" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac overload</z:e>, referral to a cardiologist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0001528'>hemihypertrophy</z:hpo> and/or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023221" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">leg length discrepancy</z:e>, referral to an orthopedist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Surveillance: repeat imaging studies if clinical signs/symptoms of <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp>/AVFs become evident </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Agents/circumstances to avoid: It is suggested that routine use of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> be avoided unless indicated for treatment of a different medical condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Testing of relatives at risk: If the family-specific mutation is known, molecular genetic testing of at-risk relatives allows early diagnosis and, thus, prompt treatment of <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp>/AVFs in order to reduce/avoid secondary adverse outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>At-risk infants are candidates for prompt diagnosis given the early presentation of neurologic complications from intracranial <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp>/AVFs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>GENETIC COUNSELING: RASA1-related disorders are inherited in an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Most individuals diagnosed with a RASA1-related disorder have an affected parent; 30% of cases are caused by a de novo mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Each child of an individual with a RASA1-related disorder has a 50% chance of inheriting the mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Prenatal diagnosis for pregnancies at increased risk is possible if the disease-causing mutation of an affected family member is known </plain></SENT>
