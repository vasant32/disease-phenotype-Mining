<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, careful study of surgical procedures using the lateral approach described in the literature shows differences in the approach to the ventricles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We discuss the application of transventricular hemispherotomy as a technique which provides relatively easy ventricular access for cerebral hemispherotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transventricular hemispherotomy was successfully performed in a 36-year-old woman who was diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096063" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intractable epilepsy</z:e> due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber disease</z:e>, and in a 25-year-old man who had developed intractable post-traumatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> after suffering cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0009275'>contusion</z:mp> in a traffic accident as a child </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These patients had no <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> or complications after surgery, and both patients have been weaned from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">antiepileptic</z:chebi> drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The transventricular approach, as compared with other lateral approaches described in the literature, provides easy access to the ventricular cavity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Transventricular hemispherotomy proved to be a useful approach that allowed the following four common steps in cerebral hemispherotomy to be performed safely: (i) interruption of the internal capsule and <z:chebi fb="47" ids="37409">corona</z:chebi> radiata; (ii) resection of the medial temporal structures; (iii) transventricular corpus callosotomy; and (iv) disruption of the frontal horizontal fibers </plain></SENT>
