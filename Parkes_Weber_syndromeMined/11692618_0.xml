<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To investigate by histopathology the cause of secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CASE: A 10-year-old boy with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> in the right eye is reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Trabeculectomy was performed because of uncontrolled intraocular pressure and the trabeculectomy specimen was examined histologically by both light and electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Histological examination of the trabeculectomy specimen showed the ciliary muscle dislocated anteriorly and there was no <z:mp ids='MP_0005204'>Schlemm's canal</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The spaces in juxtacanalicular connective tissue(JCT) were replaced by vascular structures and connective tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were two kinds of vascular structures, one where the endothelium was surrounded by pericytes and the other where it was not surrounded by pericytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Developmental abnormalities of <z:mp ids='MP_0005204'>Schlemm's canal</z:mp> and JCT may have caused <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> in this case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These observations suggested that development of both mesoderm and neural crest might be involved in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
