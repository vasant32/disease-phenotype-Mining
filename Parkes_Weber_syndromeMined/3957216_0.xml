<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients had congenital vascular malformations, most frequently AV-<z:mp ids='MP_0002947'>angiomas</z:mp> (9 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber-Syndrome</z:e> and a venous <z:mp ids='MP_0002947'>angioma</z:mp> were found in two cases and one patient had an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty-eight patients had acquired cerebrovascular diseases such as ischaemic infarctions (22), intracranial haemorrhages without vascular malformations (14) and thromboses of the dural sinus (2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cerebral infraction was a complication of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> in 8 children, two others suffered from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal insufficiency</z:hpo> and were on haemodialysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two children had a trauma of the internal carotid artery and in one patient a large haemorrhagic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> was caused by <z:hpo ids='HP_0004906'>hypernatremic dehydration</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 9 patients (6 females, 3 males) no obvious aetiology of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> could be found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, in most of these cases a nonspecific <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0743841" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">febrile illness</z:e> preceded the neurological manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the dural sinus occurred in a 6-week old previously healthy infant and in a 3-year old boy as a complication of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0000100'>nephrotic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Intracranial haemorrhages (without cerebrovascular malformations) occurred in 14 patients, mainly as a complication of haematological diseases (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_339'>lymphatic leukaemia</z:mpath>, severe aplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0684275" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">haemophilia</z:e> A, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0866588" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus erythematodes</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Four children had spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhages without obvious causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The prognosis for survival was good in children with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, but persisting neurological deficits were more severe than in children with haemorrhages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>At the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage the <z:mp ids='MP_0010769'>lethality</z:mp> was higher in children with intracranial haemorrhages </plain></SENT>
