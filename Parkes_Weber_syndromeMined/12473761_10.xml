<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Epilepsy</z:e> affects 80% of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome</z:e>; the majority of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> begin before the age of 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>When <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> are intractable to medications and unihemispheric, hemispherectomy is often advised </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine the natural history of patients who underwent hemispherectomy and identify the outcomes in terms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> reduction, cognition, and motor deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A questionnaire was mailed to the parents of patients identified by the Sturge-Weber Foundation as having had a hemispherectomy between 1979 and 2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Forty-six percent (32/70) of the parents responded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> was 4 months, and the median age at surgery was 1.2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Children had failed to respond to 3.7 anticonvulsants prior to surgery and averaged 387 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>/month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Forty-seven percent had complications (e.g., <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>) in the perioperative period; however, 81% are currently <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo>-free, with 53% off <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">anticonvulsants</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Hemispherectomy type (anatomic versus functional versus hemidecortication) did not influence outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> did not predict <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> freedom; however, an older age at hemispherectomy was positively correlated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> was not more severe than before surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Cognitive outcome was not related to the age at operation, side of operation, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> freedom </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Children undergoing hemispherectomy presented at a young age and had frequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> for approximately 1 year but are now mostly <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo>-free </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Age at surgery did not have an adverse effect on either <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> or cognitive outcomes </plain></SENT>
