<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Cerebral functional imaging methods provide information on the location of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> focus in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014547" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">partial epilepsy</z:e> of adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report our experience of one of these methods, single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography (SPECT), in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> of children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SPECT enables the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) to be measured, after inhalation or injection of 133-<z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">Xenon</z:chebi>, on 5 contiguous, 20 mm thick axial sections, with a 14 mm resolution and negligible brain irradiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome</z:e> (13 patients aged 9 months to 18 years) the rCBF was reduced in the same territory as CT abnormalities suggesting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> of the brain tissue lying below the pial <z:mp ids='MP_0002947'>angioma</z:mp>; the SPECT image facilitated the diagnosis in 3 patients with atypical CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0007206'>hemimegalencephaly</z:hpo> (6 patients aged 1 month to 10 years) the rCBF was extremely low in the hypertrophic hemisphere and in 1 case the SPECT image was determinant in the decision to perform hemispherectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014547" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">partial epilepsy</z:e> with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CT and/or MRI (42 children aged 1 to 15 years) the rCBF was abnormal in 83% of the patients, and its abnormality was located in the same area as the EEG focus in three quarters of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, the rCBF was low in 3 out of 4 cases and abnormality decreased after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> had ceased (6 patients explored twice); it was high in 1 out of 4 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, in children as in adults, cerebral functional imaging provides new data which contribute to the localization and follow-up of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> foci </plain></SENT>
