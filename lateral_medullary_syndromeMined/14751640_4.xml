<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> that involve the origin of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) and require occlusion of the vertebral artery (VA), revascularization of the PICA is commonly performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present six patients with dissecting VA <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> who underwent PICA-PICA anastomosis combined with parent <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: After a lower lateral suboccipital craniectomy and partial resection of the jugular tubercle, anastomoses were performed in a side-to-side fashion at the posterior medullary segment of the PICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The VA was subsequently occluded by clipping proximal and distal to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, and the PICA was occluded by clipping distal to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Postoperative cerebral angiography demonstrated patency of the anastomosis and regression of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> in five of six patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The remaining patient experienced <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> from contralateral VA dissection and subsequently died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One patient experienced <z:hpo ids='HP_0003198'>myopathy</z:hpo> of the lower extremities secondary to intraoperative fixed board compression and developed permanent lower extremity <z:hpo ids='HP_0001324'>muscular weakness</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The remaining four cases experienced no new neurologic deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: PICA-PICA anastomosis is a useful procedure for reconstruction of the PICA when parent vessel occlusion or trapping is necessary to exclude a VA <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> involving the origin of the PICA </plain></SENT>
