<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate quiet standing balance of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wallenberg syndrome</z:e> before and after rehabilitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Six patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wallenberg syndrome</z:e> were enrolled within one month after being affected by an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> of the lateral medulla </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Quiet standing balance was assessed using posturography with eyes open and closed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The assessment was repeated after the patients had undergone rehabilitation treatment for three to nine months, and the results of the two assessments were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The quiet standing balance evaluation was performed by measurement of center of pressure (CoP) movement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the initial test, the mean scores of mediolateral and anteroposterior speed, velocity movement, mediolateral and anteroposterior extent of CoP were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> high, indicating impairments of quiet standing balance in the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After rehabilitation treatment, the anteroposterior speed and extent, the mediolateral speed and extent, and velocity moment of CoP showed statistically significant reductions in the eyes open condition (p&lt;0.05), and the anteroposterior speed and extent and velocity moment of CoP had decreased in the eyes closed condition (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mediolateral speed and extent of CoP in the eyes closed condition had also decreased, but the reduction was not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated improvements of quiet standing balance, especially anteroposterior balance, in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wallenberg syndrome</z:e> following rehabilitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We suggest that balance training is important in the rehabilitation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wallenberg syndrome</z:e> and that, as an objective measure of balance status, posturography is useful in the assessment of quiet standing balance </plain></SENT>
