<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To discuss a case in which a patient with a previously injured vertebral artery underwent manipulation in the upper cervical spine without alteration of her symptom pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The literature concerning the relative safety of specific upper cervical manipulative techniques is reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL FEATURES: A 42-year-old woman had a 3-week history of unilateral suboccipital pain that she related to a sudden twisting of her head and neck that occurred while she was putting sheets of drywall on top of her car </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subsequent examination by a neurologist 2 weeks later was unremarkable, and a tension-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> was diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Approximately 10 days later (3 weeks after injury), a single high-velocity upper-cervical manipulation (incorporating slight rotation and full lateral flexion) was performed with no change in her symptom pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two weeks after that, the patient had development of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lateral medullary syndrome</z:e> (also known as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wallenberg syndrome</z:e>) after she briefly extended and rotated her upper cervical spine while painting a ceiling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION AND OUTCOME: The patient was treated with <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy, and the lateral medullary <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> healed without incident </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The spinocerebellar and subtle motor symptoms also resolved, but the ipsilateral suboccipital <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0010829'>loss of temperature sensation</z:hpo> associated with the spinothalamic tract lesion were still present 9 months later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This case report demonstrates that vigorous manipulation of the upper cervical spine is possible without injuring an already damaged vertebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that the line of drive used during the single manipulation, almost pure lateral flexion with slight rotation, was responsible for the apparent innocuous response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Guidelines for the evaluation and management of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338586" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vertebral artery dissection</z:e> are reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Because it is currently impossible to identify patients at risk of having a dissected vertebral artery with standard in-office examination procedures, rotational manipulation of the upper cervical spine should be abandoned by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> practitioners, and schools should remove such techniques from their curriculums </plain></SENT>
