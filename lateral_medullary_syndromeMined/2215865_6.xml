<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During the course of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wallenberg's syndrome</z:e>, patients often complain of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We thought that these <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> might be caused by dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp>) of the vertebral artery, and so we studied the incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp> in our cases with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wallenberg's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although many variants exist, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wallenberg's syndrome</z:e> encompasses several neurological symptoms due to a disorder of the nucleus and nerve tracts located in the lateral part of the medulla </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We diagnosed our patients as having <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wallenberg's syndrome</z:e> on the basis of symptoms such as loss of pain and temperature sensation in the unilateral face and contralateral body, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>cerebellar ataxia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002357'>dysphasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We investigated 22 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wallenberg's syndrome</z:e> over a five-year period, and excluded patients who developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> upon <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our cases can be divided into two groups; one with severe stenosis or occlusion of VA (n = 15) and the other with occlusion of PICA (n = 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The angiograms of the two remaining patients showed no abnormal findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean age of the VA group (42.5 yrs.) was younger than that of the PICA group (64.2 yrs.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The age distribution of the PICA group is similar to that of other occlusive cerebrovascular diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Seven cases of the VA group demonstrated aneurysmal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> stenosis, and so they were diagnosed as having dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of VA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
