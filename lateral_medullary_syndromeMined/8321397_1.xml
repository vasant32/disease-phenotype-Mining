<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Four patients (1 male, 3 female), age ranging from 43 to 62, were operated upon in our department during the last 6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Duration from rupture to the operation was 0 to 4 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 2 cases, proximal clipping was the primary treatment, while 2 had a trapping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Antiplatelet agents were given to prevent vasospasm in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In proximal clipping cases, one patient had suffered from fatal rerupture on the sixth postoperative day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In trapping cases, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wallenberg syndrome</z:e> developed in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that a proximal clipping may not allow the treatment for the vasospasm because of the danger of rebleeding and also a trapped segment of vertebral artery should be as short as possible to avoid compromised perforators </plain></SENT>
