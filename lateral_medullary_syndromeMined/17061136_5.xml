<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To identify patient characteristics and angiographic features that predict high risk for rebleeding in vertebral artery (VA) dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analyzed 62 patients treated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) from VA dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> (male: female, 46:16; mean age, 51.7 +/- 8 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Univariate and multivariate stepwise logistic regression analyses were performed to assess relationships between rebleeding rate and age, gender, history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, sidedness of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, angiographic configuration, and location relative to the origin of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rebleeding occurred in 22 patients (37%), mostly within 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients without rebleeding had favorable outcomes, while patients with rebleeding showed higher mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Angiographic patterns with high rebleeding rates included "stenosis and dilation" (50%), and "lateral protrusion" (43%), contrasting with "dilation and stenosis" (20%) and other types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Rebleeding also was likely in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> proximal to or at the PICA origin (rate, 47% or 46%) than distal to the PICA origin (21%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariate logistic regression analysis found two factors independently associated with rebleeding: angiographic pattern of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> (odds ratio 1.88:1, P=0.0366), and location relative to the PICA origin (odds ratio 4.93:1, P=0.028) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>High risk of rebleeding in VA dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> can be predicted by angiographic configurations such as "stenosis and dilation" and "lateral protrusion" and by location at or proximal to the PICA origin </plain></SENT>
