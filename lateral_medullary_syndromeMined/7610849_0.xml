<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To determine the lesions and the lateralization in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wallenberg's syndrome</z:e>, visually-guided eye movements were quantitatively analysed and these findings were compared with a lesioned site as revealed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The 8 patients could be clearly classified into two subgroups based on the functional test of eye movements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 4 patients, optokinetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000639'>nystagmus</z:hpo> (OKN), pursuit eye movements and fixation-suppression of caloric <z:hpo ids='HP_0000639'>nystagmus</z:hpo> (FS), utilizing the slow phase velocity as a parameter, were impaired toward the lesioned side in the medulla </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the remaining 4 patients, OKN and pursuit eye movements were impaired toward the side contralateral to the lesion, whereas FS toward the lesioned side, indicating a lesion affecting not only the medulla but also the inferior peduncle and/or the cerebellum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the functional visually-guided eye movements can provide a useful test battery with which to detect the lesion site in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wallenberg's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
