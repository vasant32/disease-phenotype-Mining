<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventy-four patients with PICA territory ischemic lesion proved by DWI with decreased apparent diffusion coefficient and FLAIR (fluid attenuation inversion recovery) included in our Registry, corresponding to 2% of 3,650 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The presence of steno-occlusive lesions in the posterior circulation were sought by magnetic resonance angiography, and reviewed with a three-dimensional rotating cineangiographic method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found six subgroups of PICA territory <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> according clinico-topographical relationship: (1) 9 patients with lesion in the territory lateral branch of PICA; (2) 23 patients with an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in the territory of medial branch of PICA; (3) 9 patients with a lesion involving both medial and lateral branches of the PICA; (4) 9 patients with cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> at the boundary zones either between medial and lateral branches of the PICA or between PICA and m/l superior cerebellar artery (SCA); (5) 10 patients with a lesion at the deep boundary zones either between medial and lateral PICA, or between PICA and medial/lateral SCA; (6)14 patients with concomitant multiple lesions in the PICA and in other vertebrobasilar artery territories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The main cause of PICA <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> was extracranial large-artery disease in 30 patients (41%) patients, cardioembolism and in situ branch disease in 15 patients (20%) each </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Multiple PICA territory lesions on DWI were not uncommon and could be caused by multiple emboli originating from break-up of atherosclerotic plaque in the subclavian/innominate-vertebral arterial system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DWI findings of single or multiple small lesions could account for some cases with transient and subtle cerebellar symptoms which have been considered before as '<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042568" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vertebrobasilar insufficiency</z:e>' without morphologic lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Different clinical-DWI correlations allow us to determine better definition of the topographical and etiological spectrum of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> PICA territory lesions, which was previously defined by pathological and conventional MRI studies </plain></SENT>
