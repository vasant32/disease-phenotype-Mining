<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The course of normalisation of the tilts of subjective visual vertical (SVV) in 50 patients who had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wallenberg's syndrome</z:e> were retrospectively compared with that in 50 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> vestibular <z:mp ids='MP_0006082'>neuritis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The deviation of SVV significantly decreased over time within days to weeks in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This finding shows that the time courses of the central compensation for dorsolateral medullary infarctions and peripheral vestibular lesions are similar </plain></SENT>
