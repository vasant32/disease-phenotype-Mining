<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>TOPOSCOUT is an expert system designed to diagnose the anatomic location and the corresponding vascular territory of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> based on the clinical signs and symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The inference engine of TOPOSCOUT uses a backtracking algorithm and a rule-based data base that includes associations of neurologic signs with vascular and anatomic areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>TOPOSCOUT is capable of detecting typical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patterns, for example, "top-of-the-basilar" or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wallenberg's syndromes</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The accuracy of TOPOSCOUT's diagnoses has been tested for conformity with the final diagnoses of 129 patients in the Hamburg <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Data Bank, and a high level of agreement was found for hemispheric lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The program runs on microcomputers with MS-DOS and is intended as a practical aid for physicians not fully familiar with topologic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> diagnosis and as an interactive teaching device </plain></SENT>
