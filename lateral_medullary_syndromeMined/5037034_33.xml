<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wallenberg syndrome</z:e> was made clinically in seven cases and at necropsy in another </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The clinical features of one other case were closely allied to but not typical of this syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An afferent delay of the late reflex on the side of the lesion in the presence of a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> early reflex was seen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but two cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In one of the latter, the late reflex was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and in the other, a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009421" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">comatose</z:e> patient, the late reflex was totally absent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It was concluded that the neurones of the first order responsible for the bilateral late reflex on unilateral stimulation terminate in the ipsilateral spinal nucleus of the trigeminal nerve without significant crossing over to the same structure on the other side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An afferent delay of the late reflex in the presence of a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or nearly <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> early reflex is consistent with a lateral medullary lesion implicating the spinal tract and nucleus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wallenberg syndrome</z:e> is a common clinical entity showing this abnormality of the orbicularis oculi reflex </plain></SENT>
