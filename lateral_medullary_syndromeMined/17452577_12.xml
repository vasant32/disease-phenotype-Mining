<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the characteristics and diagnostic value of this post-<z:mp ids='MP_0002730'>head-shaking</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000639'>nystagmus</z:hpo> (HSN) have not been studied systematically in central vestibulopathy, and little is known of the mechanisms involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed spontaneous and HSN and the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2972">baclofen</z:chebi>, a <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi>(B) <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi>, in 16 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lateral medullary infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: These patients showed several characteristics of HSN unlike those observed in peripheral vestibulopathy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>HSN was observed in 14 of 16 patients (87.5%), and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, the horizontal component beats toward the lesion side, i.e., was ipsilesional </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Even in the eight patients with contralesional spontaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000666'>horizontal nystagmus</z:hpo>, the HSN was opposite to the spontaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000639'>nystagmus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three patients showed unusually strong HSN with a maximum slow-phase velocity greater than 60 degrees/second </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Visual fixation markedly suppressed HSN and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2972">baclofen</z:chebi> reduced HSN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In most of the patients, MRI showed infarctions in the caudal or middle portion of the medulla and spared the rostral portion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We propose that <z:mp ids='MP_0002730'>head-shaking</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000639'>nystagmus</z:hpo> in lateral medullary infarction is due to unilaterally impaired nodulouvular inhibition of the velocity storage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This proposal is consistent with the results of neuroanatomic studies that demonstrate that Purkinje cells controlling velocity storage in the nodulus and ventral uvula project to the caudal or middle portion of the vestibular nuclei, whereas those subserving visual-vestibular interactions in the flocculus project to the more rostral portion </plain></SENT>
