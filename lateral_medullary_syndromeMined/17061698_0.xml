<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In this study, the clinical features and MRI findings of 21 patients admitted for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lateral medullary syndrome</z:e>, including 10 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo>, were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>According to Cytoarchitecture of the Human Brain Stem (Olszewski, J &amp; Baxter, D), MRI-identified lesions were classified into four groups based on their location (upper, middle-upper, middle-lower, and lower parts of the medulla oblongata) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also examined whether each lesion involved the ambiguous nucleus (AN) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We then studied the correlation between <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> and involvement of the AN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ten patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo>, which improved very quickly in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the horizontal plane, lesions of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> exhibited AN involvement, suggesting that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> is strongly correlated with AN involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among the 8 patients with lesions in the upper part of the medulla oblongata, the lesions of 7 patients included the AN, and 6 of those 7 patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among the 5 patients with lesions in the middle-upper part of the medulla oblongata, the lesions of two contained the AN, and one of those two patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among the 6 patients with lesions in the middle-lower part of the medulla oblongata, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> lesions contained the AN, but only 3 of the patients exhibited <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In both patients who had lesions in the lower part of the medulla oblongata, the lesions did not include the AN and neither patient had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients who had lesions involving the AN in the rostral part of the medulla oblongata were more likely to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> than the other patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, half of the patients with lesions involving the AN in the middle-lower part of the medulla oblongata did not have <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This might suggest that the caudal part of the AN has little involvement in the mechanisms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
