<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 69-year-old woman presented with an extremely rare sigmoid sinus dural <z:hpo ids='HP_0004947'>arteriovenous fistula</z:hpo> (AVF) with venous drainage into a spinal perimedullary vein manifesting only as brainstem dysfunction without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002196'>myelopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cerebral angiography showed retrograde venous drainage into both the brainstem and spinal cord through the ipsilateral bridging vein from the affected isolated sigmoid sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) imaging showed a hyperintense lesion in the medulla oblongata and lower pons with increased apparent diffusion coefficient (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>), and enhancement with contrast material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The dural AVF was successfully treated by transfemoral transvenous embolization from the contralateral side, but the hyperintense area and neurological symptoms persisted after the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The neurological deficits were probably due to venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> associated with accessory retrograde venous drainage into the brainstem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging enhancement of the lesion may be more closely related to the prognosis of neurological deficits than the <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> value </plain></SENT>
