<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We described two cases of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lateral medullary syndrome</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wallenberg's syndrome</z:e>) due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338586" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vertebral artery dissection</z:e> following minimal neck injuries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The first case was a 45-year-old man, who hit his head and often rotated his head because of posterior neck discomfort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two years after the injury, he suffered from sudden sharp neck pain, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002321'>vertigo</z:hpo>, which was followed by left hand numbness and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002355'>difficulty in walking</z:hpo> due to the right <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lateral medullary syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Angiography showed right <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338586" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vertebral artery dissection</z:e> at the fourth segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The second case, a 48-year-old man, suffered from neck pain immediately after he hyperextended his neck for painting a wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Within several hours, he experienced left hand numbness and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002355'>difficulty in walking</z:hpo> due to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lateral medullary syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Angiography showed a saccular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and dissection of the right vertebral artery at the fourth segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In both cases, minor traumas were thought to be the causes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338586" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vertebral artery dissection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We surveyed previously reported 84 cases (men: 50, women: 34) of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338586" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vertebral artery dissection</z:e> due to minor traumas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Seventy per cent of patients were in their third or fourth decade of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The main causes of trauma preceding the dissection were neck manipulation especially chiropractics (52%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The third segment was most vulnerable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Delay in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> following neck trauma could be more than a week, but in most cases the delay was less than 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Cervical rotation and extension were thought to precipitate dissection </plain></SENT>
