<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To determine the causative factors of unsuccessful microvascular decompression for <z:hpo ids='HP_0010828'>hemifacial spasm</z:hpo>, the follow-up results in 53 patients were assessed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up period was 36 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were 32 patients who had compression of the seventh cranial nerve ventrocaudally by an anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA) or a posterior inferior cerebellar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of these 32 patients, 30 (94%) had excellent postoperative results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of 14 patients with more severe compression by the vertebral artery, nine (64%) had excellent results, three (21%) had good results, and two (14%) had poor results; in this group, three patients with excellent results experienced transient spasm recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were seven patients in whom the meatal branch of the AICA coursed between the seventh and eighth cranial nerves and compressed the dorsal aspect of the seventh nerve; this was usually associated with another artery compressing the ventral aspect of the nerve ("sandwich-type" compression) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of these seven patients, five (71%) had poor results including operative failure in one and recurrence of spasm in four </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The authors conclude that the clinical outcome was closely related to the patterns of vascular compression </plain></SENT>
