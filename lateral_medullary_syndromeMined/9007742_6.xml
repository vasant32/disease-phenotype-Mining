<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Study of the blink reflex (BR) in patients with WS can help in reaching a better understanding of the physiopathology underlying clinical symptoms and may help in the prediction of clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the BR in response to supraorbital nerve electrical stimuli in 20 patients with WS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were studied within the 1st week after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms, and 10 of them were also studied repeatedly during a follow-up period of 3-12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At the first examination the long latency bilateral responses (R2 and R2c) to stimulation of the supraorbital nerve of the affected side were absent in 11, delayed in 4, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in 5 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At follow-up, there was a normalization of the BR in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients who had absent or delayed responses at the first examination except for one patient whose responses remained absent at the 9th month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Late responses elicited on the side of the lesion by stimulation of the non-affected supraorbital nerve were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This patient died from <z:hpo ids='HP_0006543'>cardiorespiratory arrest</z:hpo> within the 1st month of the illness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One patient with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> BR responses also died in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The BR is abnormal in most patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> WS and tends to normalize in a mean period of 7 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>BR pattern is not a predictor of early fatal complications in patients with this syndrome </plain></SENT>
