<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> that require occlusion of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA), revascularization of this artery should be performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A novel surgical method for revascularization of the PICA is presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: After a segment of the superficial temporal artery (STA) was harvested, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was treated by trapping, followed by placement of a vertebral artery (VA)-PICA bypass in which the STA segment was used as a graft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When the length of the proximal PICA was inadequate, the distal end of the STA was anastomosed to the proximal PICA in an end-to-side fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When the length of the proximal PICA was adequate, the STA was anastomosed to the proximal PICA in an end-to-end fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In either case, the proximal end of the STA was anastomosed to the VA in an end-to-side fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This procedure was used in nine patients whose <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> involved the PICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although partial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lateral medullary syndrome</z:e> developed in one of them, follow-up evaluation revealed graft patency in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no instances of recurrent <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although this procedure requires harvesting of an STA graft and two anastomoses, it facilitates anterograde flow to the PICA territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It also involves minimal mobilization of brainstem perforating vessels and the proximal PICA </plain></SENT>
