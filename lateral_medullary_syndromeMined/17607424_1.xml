<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: 41 patients with previous diagnostic of AFP were submitted to a standardized evaluation protocol, by a multidisciplinary pain team </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 21 (51.2%) were considered AFP and 20 (48.8%) (SFP) received the following diagnosis: 8 (40.0%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039494" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">temporomandibular disorders</z:e> (TMD); 3 (15.0%) had TMD associated to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442893" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">systemic disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0016053" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fibromyalgia</z:e>, systemic erythematosus <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e>); 4 (20.0%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> after ear, nose and throat (ENT) surgery for petroclival <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>; 2 (10.0%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wallenberg syndrome</z:e>; 1 (5.0%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527390" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">intracranial tumor</z:e>; 1 (5.0%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153381" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">oral cancer</z:e> (epidermoid <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>), and 1 (5.0%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006430" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">burning mouth syndrome</z:e> (BMS) associated to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0016053" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fibromyalgia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Spontaneous descriptors of pain were not different between AFP and SFP groups (p=0.82) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0003177'>Allodynia</z:mp> was frequent in SFP (p=0.05) and emotion was the triggering factor most prevalent in AFP (p=0.06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>AFP patients had more traumatic events previously to pain (p=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: AFP patients had more: a) traumatic events previously to pain <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, and b) emotions as a triggering factor for pain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data support the need of trained health professionals in multidisciplinary groups for the accurate diagnosis and treatment of these patients </plain></SENT>
