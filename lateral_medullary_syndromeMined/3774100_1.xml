<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An afferent delay or block of the late reflexes is closely related to a lesion of the lateral medullary portion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The chronological alteration of blink reflex (BR) was studied to compare with radiological abnormalities on MRI in a patient with lateral medullary infarction on the right side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wallenberg syndrome</z:e> was made clinically and location of the lesion was identified in detail by MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The infarcted region which was well demonstrated as an increased intensity area on SE images obtained 52 days after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms was much smaller than that on SE as well as on IR image 21 days after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it was concluded that more than half of the increased intensity area on the SE images obtained 21 days after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms recovered from the condition of being extremely damaged by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> on the right lateral medullary portion in this patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, in the initial BR 26 days after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms, the late reflexes (R2) were consistently absent bilaterally when the affected side (right) was stimulated and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> when the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> side (left) was stimulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This type of BR abnormality is compatible with an afferent block of late reflexes (R2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The early reflex (R1) was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> on either side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Whereas in the second BR at 55 days after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms, the late reflexes turned to be <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in latency when the right side was stimulated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
