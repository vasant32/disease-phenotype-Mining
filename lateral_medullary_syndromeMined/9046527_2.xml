<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, there were <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images of infarction located in the area supplied by the AICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The lesion was on the left side in 6 patients and right side in 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lesion of brain</z:e> stem including the middle cerebellar peduncle was found in 7 patients and that extended to the cerebellum was in 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The main ipsilateral neurological signs were the VII and VIII <z:hpo ids='HP_0006824'>cranial nerves palsy</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>cerebellar ataxia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The V and VI <z:hpo ids='HP_0006824'>cranial nerves palsy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002277'>Horner's syndrome</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> were also present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The main contralateral sign was superficial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0152027" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sensory disturbance</z:e>, but no <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The underlying pathology included chiefly <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cerebral angiography was performed in 8 patients, most of which was observed severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> suggesting poor hemodynamics in the vertebral and basilar arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The prognosis was relatively good, but the VII, VIII, and V <z:hpo ids='HP_0006824'>cranial nerves palsy</z:hpo> and contralateral superficial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0152027" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sensory disturbance</z:e> remained as the sequelae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>As mentioned above, there were various neurological findings and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images in AICA territory <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Especially there were some patients whose lesion extended to the upper medulla and neurological findings were similar to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wallenberg syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It is important that one investigates not only axial slices but also coronal slices of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> image to estimate the extension of AICA territory <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
