<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL and METHODS: This case report presents a 35-year-old woman who had been referred with a hemorrhagic <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> five years ago </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This patient has recently undergone microsurgical excision for her left parieto-occipital Grade II <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> and surgical clipping of the left posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> which was concomitantly detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>She is the oldest case reported whose <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> recurred as Grade III, which is bigger than her first <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> associated with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although some authors do not propose routine additional follow-up in adults after the initial negative postoperative angiogram, we believe that such patients should be followed clinically and radiologically </plain></SENT>
