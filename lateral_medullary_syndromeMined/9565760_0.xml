<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two patients with anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA) infarction and hearing loss as presenting complaint, are described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In patient 1 progressive bilateral AICA infarction was caused by occlusion of the basilar artery, verified by transcranial Doppler sonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Initial dizziness and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018775" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bilateral hearing loss</z:e> were followed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001260'>dysarthria</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> and right facial <z:hpo ids='HP_0003474'>sensory impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hearing loss improved during the second week, parallel to a temporary partial recanalisation of the basilar artery, but the patient subsequently developed further progressive brain stem symptoms and died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A right-sided AICA-infarction was diagnosed in patient 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Initial symptoms were right-sided <z:hpo ids='HP_0000365'>deafness</z:hpo> and dizziness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neurological examination revealed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000639'>nystagmus</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> and involvement of th 5th and 6th cranial nerve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A progressive improvement of hearing loss and total recovery of the other brain stem symptoms was evident </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion every patient with sudden hearing loss should be examined for additional brain stem symptoms since this can be the presenting sign of a life-threatening basilar artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
