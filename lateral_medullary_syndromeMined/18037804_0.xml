<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 38-year-old man presented with a dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the left proximal posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) manifesting as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wallenberg's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patient was treated by endovascular occlusion of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and parent artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immediately after the treatment, the PICA territory was supplied by collateral circulation via the ipsilateral anterior inferior cerebellar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seven days later, endogenous revascularization of the distal PICA territory had occurred via collateral circulation from the posterior meningeal artery (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This unusual collateral circulation was thought to occur through a pre-existing anastomotic channel between the primitive vessels of the PICA and the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi> during subclinical hypoperfusion of the distal PICA territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This unusual case demonstrates the potential for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>delayed development</z:hpo> of collateral circulation from the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi> to the PICA territory </plain></SENT>
