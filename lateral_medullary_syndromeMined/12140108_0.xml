<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The clinical course was complicated by the sudden appearance of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lateral medullary syndrome</z:e> (Wallenberg), which completely resolved after <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During this course, CT-angiography (CTA) enabled monitoring of both the progression and partial resolution of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> in the occluded VA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An anatomical variant of a perforating artery originating from the VA proximal to the posterior inferior cerebral artery (PICA) was subsequently demonstrated, explaining the ischemic event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The value of CTA in clinical management is discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The prophylactic use of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy especially in the case of a perforating artery to the lateral medulla originating proximally to the PICA, is suggested </plain></SENT>
