<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Six patients with bulbar pain caused by lateral medullary <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> were treated by stimulation therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Dysesthesia on the opposite side of the body was subjected to stimulation therapy in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of the subjects, 4 underwent thalamic stimulation and 3 were treated by motor cortex stimulation; the effects of both thalamic and motor cortex stimulation were investigated in 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No satisfactory pain control was obtained by thalamic stimulation in any of the patients in this series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, 2 of the 3 patients treated by motor cortex stimulation reported satisfactory pain control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The pain inhibition usually occurred at intensities below the threshold for the production of muscle contraction (pulse duration, 0.1-0.5 ms; intensity, 3-8 V) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This finding was consistent with our previous observations made in a series of patients with thalamic pain, indicating that motor cortex stimulation is significantly more useful than thalamic stimulation for controlling <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007462" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">deafferentation pain</z:e> secondary to central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We discuss the possibility that better control of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007462" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">deafferentation pain</z:e> may be provided by stimulation at a level more rostral to the site of deafferentation </plain></SENT>
