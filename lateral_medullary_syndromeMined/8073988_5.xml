<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To assess the prevalence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338586" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vertebral artery dissection</z:e> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wallenberg syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixteen patients (12 men, 4 women; mean age at ictus, 51.6 years) with symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wallenberg syndrome</z:e> and an infarction demonstrated in the lateral medulla on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> were reviewed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study items were as follows: (a) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> as clinical signs, in particular, occipitalgia and/or posterior neck pain at ictus; (b) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> findings, such as intramural <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> on T1-weighted images, intimal flap on T2-weighted images, and double lumen on three-dimensional spoiled gradient-recalled acquisition in a steady state with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31797">gadopentetate dimeglumine</z:chebi>; (c) direct angiographic findings of dissection, such as double lumen, intimal flap, and resolution of stenosis on follow-up angiography; and (d) indirect angiographic findings of dissection (such as string sign, pearl and string sign, tapered narrowing, etc) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were classified as definite dissection if they had reliable <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> findings (ie, intramural <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp>, intimal flap, and enhancement of wall and septum) and/or direct angiographic findings; as probable dissection if they showed both <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and suspected findings (ie, double lumen on 3-D spoiled gradient-recalled acquisition in a steady state or indirect angiographic findings); and as suspected dissection in those with only <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> or suspected findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seven of 16 patients were classified as definite dissection, 3 as probable dissection, and 3 as suspected dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four patients were considered to have bilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338586" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vertebral artery dissection</z:e> on the basis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338586" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Vertebral artery dissection</z:e> is an important cause of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wallenberg syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
