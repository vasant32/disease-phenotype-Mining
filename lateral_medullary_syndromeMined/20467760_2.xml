<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of endovascular treatment of ruptured dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of the vertebral artery, the benefits of early embolization, and the predictors of outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between September, 2001 and May, 2009, 25 patients with ruptured vertebral dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were treated by internal coil trapping (n = 23) or stents (n = 2) in our hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were 14 males and 11 females with a mean age of 45 years (age range, 22-66 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were supra-posterior inferior cerebellar artery lesions (n = 16), infra-posterior inferior cerebellar artery lesions (n = 6), or involved the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (n = 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Complete occlusion of dissected arterial and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> segments (internal trapping) was achieved in 21 (91.3%) of 23 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The two patients with posterior inferior cerebellar artery involvement underwent double stent only placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical outcomes were favorable in 17 (68%) of 25 patients, 2 (8%) had severe disability, and 6 (24%) patients died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Risk factors that varied with favorable versus unfavorable outcomes were: preoperative Hunt-Hess, World Federation of Neurological Surgeons scale, presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo>, presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lateral medullary syndrome</z:e>, presence of low <z:hpo ids='HP_0006824'>cranial nerve palsy</z:hpo>, rebleeding, time of endovascular procedures, and time from admission to procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, univariate Cox analysis confirmed that only low preoperative Hunt-Hess grade predicted favorable clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Early embolization did not affect clinical outcome, but reduced the risk of rebleeding and inpatient stay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In our experience, internal trapping of the dissected segment with a coil was straightforward, applicable to most patients, prevented rebleeding safely and effectively without significant procedural complications, and had a good follow-up outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The low Hunt-Hess grade remained predictors of favorable clinical outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The timing of embolization did not significantly affect clinical outcome but early embolization reduces inpatient stay </plain></SENT>
