<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To clinically assess neurogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo>, and to correlate its presence with demographic features, different <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk factors, anatomical arterial territorial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> types, and pathological <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventy-two <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> inpatients were studied between July 2007 and February 2008, at the Departments of Medicine and Neurology at Al-Yarmouk Teaching Hospital, Baghdad, and Rizgary Teaching Hospital, Erbil, Iraq </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were assessed using the Mann Assessment of Swallowing Ability score (MASA), Modified Rankin Scale, and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Risk Scorecard </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were reassessed after one month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 40 males and 32 females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sixty-eight patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, and 4 had primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>According to the MASA score, 55% of anterior circulation <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (ACS) cases were associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002357'>dysphasia</z:hpo>, and 91% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lateral medullary syndrome</z:e> cases were associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fifty-six percent of ACS dysphagic cases improved within the first month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Forty percent of dysphagic patients died in the one month follow up period, and in most, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was caused by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011951'>aspiration pneumonia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We observed no significant differences regarding demographic features of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>Dysphagia</z:hpo> can be an indicator of the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> causing higher mortality and morbidity in affected patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It was not related to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk factors and the type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It is essential from a prognostic point of view to assess swallowing, and to treat its complications early </plain></SENT>
