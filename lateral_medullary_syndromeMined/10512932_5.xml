<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to assess the consequences of severe spinothalamic tract lesions resulting from lateral medullary <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and to show that a specific pain perception can be elicited by strong thermal stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CASE DESCRIPTIONS: Both patients examined presented with severe thermoalgic dissociation of the limbs contralateral to the lesion, with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> discriminative somatosensory perception and motor strength </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They reported pain perception when touching very warm (&gt;50 degrees C to 60 degrees C) objects and a brisk, occasionally uncontrolled <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0857405" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">withdrawal reaction</z:e> of the arm and hand under the same conditions, without any perception of the heat nature of the stimulus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Warm stimulation, &lt;45 degrees C, elicited no thermal perception or discrimination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pain perception could be elicited in both patients by increasing the temperature, with a reproducible threshold of 47 degrees C to 49 degrees C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pain always occurred after a prolonged delay of 8 to 10 seconds in response to threshold heat, and was described as deep and osseous, and clearly different from that perceived on the nonaffected side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The delay was much shorter when the temperature was increased by 4 degrees C to 5 degrees C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cold stimulation elicited similar pain perception in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Analysis of subjective perception of laser stimulation showed a much higher pain threshold on the affected hand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no laser-evoked potentials on this side, which suggested major spinothalamic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Assessment of the RIII noxious reflex revealed persistent response <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0857405" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">withdrawal reactions</z:e>, with an increased threshold on the affected side, and partial consciousness of the noxious nature of the stimulus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first description of the appearance of pain perception of high temperatures in patients with severe spinothalamic injury who are suffering from a complete loss of temperature perception </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This implies that noxious thermal stimulation can still be perceived via extra spinothalamic pathways (which are slow and multisynaptic), such as the spinoreticulothalamic tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wallenberg syndrome</z:e> should be informed and made aware of their residual perception of and reactions to noxious stimulation </plain></SENT>
