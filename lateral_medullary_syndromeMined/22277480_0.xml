<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> of LMI is dynamically characterized by a failure in triggering of the pharyngeal-phase swallowing movements, reduced output, and lack of coordination (swallowing pattern abnormality) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Based on accurate evaluation, we can select suitable rehabilitative approaches for individual patients, including respiratory therapy, food modification, postural changes, and oral care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We focused on the absence of upper esophageal sphincter (UES) opening of the unaffected side of the medullae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The movement pattern was defined as failure of bolus passage through the intact side of the UES, occurring at least once during the videofluorographic evaluation of each individual </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three abnormal patterns of UES opening were classified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The passage pattern abnormality shows the failure of the stereotyped motor sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For severe cases, it is necessary to consider long-term treatment, including botulinum toxin injection or surgery to prevent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> and adequate nutritional management </plain></SENT>
