<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Clinical and angiographic features and outcome in 25 patients with spontaneous dissections of the vertebral arteries are described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most patients were in their fourth or fifth decade of life, and women predominated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty-eight percent of the patients were hypertensive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Angiographic evidence of fibromuscular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was noted in one only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Brainstem ischemic symptoms (usually a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lateral medullary syndrome</z:e>) and ipsilateral occipital <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and neck pain (often preceding but sometimes associated with or following the brainstem ischemic event) were the most common clinical findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The angiographic features in decreasing order of frequency were <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> stenosis (often irregular and tapered), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, occlusion, and intimal flap </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On follow-up, most of the patients (88%) made complete or very good recoveries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Angiographic abnormalities either subsided or improved in 76% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivessel dissection (involvement of both vertebral arteries or one or both vertebral arteries and one or both internal carotid arteries) was noted in about two-thirds of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This tendency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338586" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vertebral artery dissections</z:e> to involve multiple cervicocephalic vessels concurrently, if not simultaneously, implies that four-vessel angiography should be attempted if a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338586" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vertebral artery dissection</z:e> is visualized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It also raises the possibility of an underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arteriopathy</z:e> that predisposes the vessel to dissection </plain></SENT>
