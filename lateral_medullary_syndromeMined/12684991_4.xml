<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This was followed by right <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo>, right deep <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0152027" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sensory disturbance</z:e> and left <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0585265" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoglossal nerve palsy</z:e>, consistent with the medial medullary infarction (Dejerine syndrome) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The MRI revealed infarction at left medial part of the medulla </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The vertebral angiogram and MRA showed marked narrowing of the left vertebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>X-rays of the cervical spine showed no <z:mp ids='MP_0004684'>spondylosis</z:mp>, dislocation nor <z:hpo ids='HP_0002797'>osteolysis</z:hpo> of the odontoid process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The serological studies, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi>, protein C, and protein S gave <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although vascular accidents involving the brain stem after chiropractic neck manipulation have been reported since Pratt-Thomas and Berger, previous reports are still rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In them lateral medullary infarction (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wallenberg syndrome</z:e>) is probably the most common case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, medial medullary syndrome (Dejerine syndrome) is absolutely rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, the only one report has been made by Watanabe and his colleagues before our present case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mechanism was suggested that rotation and tilting of the neck stretches and compresses the vertebral artery at the cervical joint causing injury to the vessel, with an intimal tearing, dissection, and pseudoaneurysm formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Consequently, the present case may be caused by injury to the left vertebral artery with an intimal tearing during neck manipulation sufficient to cause disection and subsequent infarction of the brain stem </plain></SENT>
