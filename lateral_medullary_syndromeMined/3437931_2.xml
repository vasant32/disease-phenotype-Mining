<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The authors present a case of dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the right posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) in a 47-year-old female, who suffered from mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Right vertebral angiogram showed typical "pearl and string" sign of the PICA, but we could not fully understand the condition until a surgical exposure revealed a purple sausage-like dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the PICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was wrapped with muscle pieces </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Postoperatively she developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wallenberg's syndrome</z:e>, but it subsided gradually </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No specific disorder concerning the mural dissection was found in this patient, except for a history of mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This case is unusual because it affected not an arterial trunk but a small branch and we could find only one other case reported in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Other formerly reported cases were of arterial trunks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The intracranial dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> has been known as a rare cause of cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in children and adolescents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Infants are also affected and referred to as "infantile <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo>" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It mainly affects one of the trunk arteries and cause a severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, and surgically treatable case is rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>But as the typical angiographic findings are commonly known the number of the reported cases is increasing at an accelerating rate, and some of them are being noted to need surgical treatment because they cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We here emphasize that not only trunk arteries but also small branch arteries can develop mural dissection, leading to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of a smaller artery would be milder in symptom, and would give more chance for surgical intervention.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
