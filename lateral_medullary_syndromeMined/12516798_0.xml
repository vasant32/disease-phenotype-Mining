<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We present a 13-year followup of a case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wallenberg's syndrome</z:e>, including a first-person account and ocular motor abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Objective infrared eye-tracking systems were used to record horizontal and vertical eye movements binocularly under a variety of conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fixation in the dark along the midline remained as before, with vestibular jerk <z:hpo ids='HP_0000639'>nystagmus</z:hpo> continuously present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>While saccades and pursuit to a visual target also remained the same as found earlier, fixation was somewhat worse, revealing not only saccadic intrusions but also a prominent right-jerk <z:hpo ids='HP_0000639'>nystagmus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: The results suggest lack of additional oculomotor neural plasticity after the end of the initial 10-year test period, and furthermore reveal apparent subtle age-related changes in oculomotor responsivity </plain></SENT>
