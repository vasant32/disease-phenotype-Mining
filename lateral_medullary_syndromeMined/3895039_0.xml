<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thanks to i.v. contrast injection, it has become possible to evaluate a lesion in the cervical vessels in at least 80% of cases and in 60% of cases when intracranial vessels are concerned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Intra-arterial contrast injection renders the diagnostic yield of DSA equal to that of conventional angiography with the benefit that the required contrast volumes are low and that the catheter need not always be placed selectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intravenous contrast injection is required with patients advanced in age, when critical cardiovascular conditions prevail, when the arterial access routes are completely occluded or in the case of postoperative checks of the cervical vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although its field of application remains restricted, particularly in the case of intravenous contrast injection, the clinical application of DSA appears well established and its advantages are undisputed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Examples are given to demonstrate the clinical boundaries set to this new imaging procedure based on i.v. and intra-arterial contrast injection </plain></SENT>
