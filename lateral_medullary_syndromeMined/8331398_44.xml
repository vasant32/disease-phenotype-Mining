<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with vertebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistulas</z:mpath> were excluded from this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The dissection was caused by trauma in three patients (two iatrogenic) and in the remaining 13 no obvious etiology was disclosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nine patients presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH), two of whom had severe cardiac disturbances secondary to the bleed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The nontraumatic dissections occurred in seven women and six men, with a mean age on discovery of 48 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients were treated with endovascular occlusion of the parent artery at or just proximal to the dissection site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One patient had occlusion of a traumatic pseudoaneurysm with preservation of the parent artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four patients required transluminal angioplasty because of severe vasospasm produced by the presenting <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> benefited from this procedure with improved arterial flow documented by transcranial Doppler ultrasonography and arteriography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 15 patients angiography disclosed complete cure of the dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One patient with a long dissection of extracranial origin extending intracranially had proximal occlusion of the dissection site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Follow-up angiography demonstrated healing of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338586" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vertebral artery dissection</z:e> but persistent filling of the artery above the balloons, which underscores the need for embolic occlusion near the dissection site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> recurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>One patient had a second SAH at the time of therapy which was immediately controlled with balloons and coils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This patient and one other had minor neurological worsening resulting from the procedure (mild <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wallenberg syndrome</z:e> in one and minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> in the second) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338586" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vertebral artery dissections</z:e> involving the intradural and extradural segments can be effectively managed by endovascular techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Balloon test occlusion and transluminal angioplasty can be useful adjuncts in the management of this disease </plain></SENT>
