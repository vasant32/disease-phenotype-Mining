<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Although many reports have examined upper cervical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> (RA) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037928" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">spinal cord disorders</z:e> resulting from RA lesions, few cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> in the vertebrobasilar system associated with RA lesions of the upper cervical spine have been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: We encountered a rare case of repeated vertebrobasilar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> with severe upper <z:hpo ids='HP_0008462'>cervical instability</z:hpo> resulting from RA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we obtained clinical images of the vertebrobasilar system just before and after the first thromboembolic event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We thus present the case of a patient with RA who recovered without surgery from repeated vertebrobasilar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> that might have been caused by severe upper <z:hpo ids='HP_0008462'>cervical instability</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Case report </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A 59-year-old man with a 14-year history of RA experienced nuchal pain because of severe atlantoaxial and vertical subluxations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>While awaiting surgery, he developed left <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wallenberg syndrome</z:e> because of occlusion in the left vertebral artery (VA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Five days later, he displayed impaired consciousness and symptoms of right <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wallenberg syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Emergency magnetic resonance angiography showed occlusion in the basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After thrombolytic therapy, he gradually recovered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Because we presumed that the patient's recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation resulted from kinking of the right VA caused by severe instability of the upper cervical spine, we planned to treat him surgically despite his impaired consciousness and tracheostomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, the anesthesiologist would not approve surgery because the patient had high-risk conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The cervical spine was thus realigned and immobilized in a halo apparatus for 3 months to achieve stability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Now, more than 5 years after these events, the patient has experienced no more <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> and his condition has remained stable, without need for surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Repeated vertebrobasilar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> in patients with RA may sometimes be caused by severe upper <z:hpo ids='HP_0008462'>cervical instability</z:hpo> that can be treated without surgery </plain></SENT>
