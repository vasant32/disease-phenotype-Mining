<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Two patients with well defined lesions of midline cerebellar structures including the fastigial nuclei on both sides presented with saccadic hypermetria but well preserved smooth pursuit eye movements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This is a remarkable finding as the oculomotor vermis (lobules VI, VII) and the fastigial nucleus are known to play a part in the control of smooth pursuit eye movements and unilateral fastigial lesions lead to a smooth pursuit deficit to the contralateral side (besides saccadic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001310'>dysmetria</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results are discussed with regard to related deficits seen in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wallenberg's syndrome</z:e> and after lesions of the pontine reticular formation </plain></SENT>
