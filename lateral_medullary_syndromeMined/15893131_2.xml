<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both pain appreciation and autonomic function are controlled by the lateral medulla </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This hypothesis proposes that lateral medullary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> at a microvascular level is responsible for these syndromes and could also be linked to other conditions where <z:hpo ids='HP_0002459'>autonomic dysfunction</z:hpo> is a major feature such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002099'>asthma</z:hpo>, type 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and essential <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Autonomic function is controlled by the nucleus tractus solitarius, which acts as the main viscero-afferent nucleus in the brain stem regulating vagal tone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is particularly susceptible to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> since it is highly metabolically active and lies in a medullary arterial watershed zone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The anatomical route of the vertebral artery through cervical vertebra makes it vulnerable to injury from whiplash with or without any genetic predisposition to atheroma formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This could make microvascular occlusion commonplace and a plausible explanation for the above syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Ischaemia</z:e> rather than infarction occurs because of the excellent collateral blood supply in the brainstem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In support of this hypothesis, a new Transcranial doppler ultrasonography arterial signal has been described called small vessel knock, the ultrasound signal of small vessel occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Recent evidence has shown that ultrasound targeting of this signal in the vertebral artery improves clinical symptoms in these syndromes which supports this hypothesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two such cases are discussed </plain></SENT>
