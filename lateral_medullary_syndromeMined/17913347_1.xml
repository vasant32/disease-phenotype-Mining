<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We herein report a 51-year-old man developed sudden dizziness, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002017'>nausea and vomiting</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CT revealed hypodense bilateral lesions over the cerebellum corresponding to the medial PICA (mPICA) branch territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>His mental state deteriorated 2 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>; repeated CT showed severe third and lateral ventricular dilation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) was done to relieve the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> obstructive <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patient was later discharged with only mild residual <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with conventional surgical treatments (external ventricular drainage, craniectomy and cerebellectomy), ETV has several advantages, including less risk and minimal invasiveness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, further study is needed on its safety and efficacy under such circumstances </plain></SENT>
