<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We determined the frequency, nature, and predictors of this complication in 63 patients with LMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The hypothesis tested was that the degree of clinical sensory loss and extent of infarction seen on MRI, both graded by a predetermined scoring scale, would be predictive of CPSP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also performed quantitative sensory testing (QST) of thermal and pressure sensation thresholds in a subgroup of 19 patients (nine with CPSP and 10 without) to analyze in detail the spinothalamic and trigeminothalamic systems mediating these modalities from both sides of the face and body </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We analyzed these results for specific markers of CPSP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CPSP developed in 25% (16/63) of the patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> within 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This was constant and severe with frequent <z:mp ids='MP_0003177'>allodynia</z:mp>, but responded in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2666">amitriptyline</z:chebi> and recurred promptly on attempted weaning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CPSP affected the ipsilateral peri-orbital region most commonly, either alone or in combination with the contralateral limbs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ipsilateral neurotrophic facial ulceration developed in two cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CPSP correlated significantly (Fisher's exact test, p &lt; 0.0002) with the degree of clinical sensory loss but not with the size of infarction seen on MRI (Fisher's exact test, p = 0.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>QST revealed a highly specific (100%) and sensitive (89%) finding for CPSP-thresholds from the check contralateral to the LMI were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in eight of nine cases with CPSP and abnormal in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the 10 cases without CPSP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Abnormalities in the face contralateral to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> are referable to the crossed trigeminothalamic tract in the medullary reticular formation medial to the infarcted lateral medulla </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We conclude that this argues for the theory that central pain is caused by denervation sensitivity of the "paleo"-reticulothalamic connections due to a selective "neo"-spinothalamic lesion </plain></SENT>
