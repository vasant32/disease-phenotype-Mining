<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This prospective, open study was carried out in order to assess changes in the swallowing and dietary status after injection of Botulinum toxin A (BoNT-A) into the upper esophageal sphincter (UES) in a series of patients with cricopharyngeus (CP) muscle dysfunction associated with pharyngo-laryngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> during at least 1 year follow-up after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients who had a cricopharyngeus (CP) muscle dysfunction associated with pharyngo-laryngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> and who were at risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The upper border of the cricoid cartilage was identified and the CP muscle localized using a standard electromyogram (EMG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The dose of BoNT-A was determined depending on the results of EMG performed just before the injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Outcomes were assessed by the penetration-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> scale (<z:chebi fb="61" ids="27565">PAS</z:chebi>), the level of residue in the pyriform sinus and the National Institute of Health-Swallow Safety Scale (NIH-SSS) on a video fluoroscopic swallowing (VFSS) assessment, the patient's subjective impressions of their ability to swallow by the Deglutition Handicap Index (DHI), and changes in dietary status by the Functional Oral Intake Scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients underwent the complete assessment of swallowing function at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After the first set of treatment, seven patients had a good response and four did not respond </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A significant decrease in the <z:chebi fb="61" ids="27565">PAS</z:chebi> score (p = 0.03), the amount of residue (p = 0.04) and the NIH-SSS score (p = 0.03) was observed 3 months after the injection in comparison with the first VFSS before the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A relapse of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> occurred in 3 out of the 11 treated patients; at 3 and 4 months for 2 patients with a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wallenberg syndrome</z:e>, and at 11 months for a patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006824'>cranial nerve paralysis</z:hpo> after a surgery for a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_402'>glomus tumor</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two of them underwent a second injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One patient had a good response and remained stable for at least 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The second did not respond either to the second injection or to a myotomy of the cricopharyngeal muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The third one is waiting for further surgery (myotomy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Therefore, at the end of the study and after a follow-up of at least 12 months, 5 patients out of the 11 enrolled had a good result </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Percutaneous injection of BoNT-A into the UES can be a useful solution to improve cricopharyngeal dysfunction, despite the underlying pharyngo-laryngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
