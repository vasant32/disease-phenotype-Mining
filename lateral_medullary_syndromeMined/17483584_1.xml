<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although the pathogenesis of central poststroke pain (CPSP) remains obscure, interactions between the spinothalamic tract and lemniscal sensory tract may be involved in its pathogenic mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CASE DESCRIPTION: A patient developed lateral medullary infarction, which produced contralateral spinothalamic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0748618" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sensory deficits</z:e> and subsequent CPSP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The CPSP gradually improved until the development of ipsilateral medial medullary infarction 26 months later, which was associated with mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> and lemniscal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0748618" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sensory deficits</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The ipsilateral medial medullary infarction immediately aggravated the CPSP to its previous level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This observation has implications regarding the pathogenesis of CPSP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CPSP may be related to hyperexcitation of the spinothalamic pathway by the reticulothalamic system, which in turn is modulated by the medial lemniscus pathway </plain></SENT>
