<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The vertical asymmetry in horizontal saccadic contrapulsion likely relates to an imbalance of fastigial oculomotor inputs on horizontal burst neurons during vertical saccades as reported in nonhuman primates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our finding suggests that such asymmetry is also present in humans and provides insight into the pathophysiology of saccade generation </plain></SENT>
