<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Five patients with lateral medullary infarction were enrolled in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Each patient underwent a battery of tests, including audiometry, caloric test, VEMP test, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Gaze <z:hpo ids='HP_0000639'>nystagmus</z:hpo> was observed in four patients (80%), while abnormal pursuit, saccade, and optokinetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000639'>nystagmus</z:hpo> tests were noted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients (100%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MRI demonstrated infarction at the ponto-medullary junction in one patient and upper medulla in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both patients revealed caloric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001284'>areflexia</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> VEMPs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, another three patients with infarction at the middle inferior olive level, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> displayed abnormal (including absent or delayed) VEMPs, and one patient showed caloric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001284'>areflexia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Topographical correlations of lateral medullary infarction with caloric and VEMP tests reveal that caloric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001284'>areflexia</z:hpo> is possibly linked with rostrally located infarction, while absent or delayed VEMPs relate to caudally located infarction </plain></SENT>
