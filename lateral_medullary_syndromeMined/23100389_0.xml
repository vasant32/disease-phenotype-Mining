<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>No abnormality was shown on CT scan, and a dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the right vertebral artery was suspected on MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cerebral angiography revealed a dissection <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the right vertebral artery involved with the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) as pearl and string sign </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient was conservatively managed under careful blood pressure control, and was followed by serial MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>He presented with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wallenberg syndrome</z:e> three weeks later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Second angiography revealed the occlusion of the PICA-involved dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and the lateral medullary segment of the PICA supplied by a newly arising vessel from the right posterior meningeal artery (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For the conservative treatment of a vertebral dissection <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> involved with PICA presenting with only pain, observation of the course by MRI was effective, and the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53780">PMA</z:chebi> could develop as the collateral channel to the PICA territory </plain></SENT>
