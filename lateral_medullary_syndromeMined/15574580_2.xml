<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Pure sensory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is a common manifestation of a thalamic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and may occur less frequently in the infarction of the brainstem, internal capsule, and parietal cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors report a 47-year-old man who presented with loss of pain and temperature sensation in the left face, arm, trunk, and leg and was found to have a right lateral medullary infarction on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To the authors' knowledge, this is the first case describing pure sensory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> as a single, isolated manifestation of the lateral medullary infarction that was detected by diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This case suggests that with the availability of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, pure sensory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> may carry a broader spectrum of the anatomical localizations than previously determined and can localize to the lateral medulla </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, a possibility of medullary infarction should be considered when a patient presents with pure sensory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, especially when diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging is not immediately available to provide radiographic correlation </plain></SENT>
