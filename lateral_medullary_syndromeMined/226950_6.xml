<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In patients with multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> (MS) abnormalities of the cervical response (N14) were found particularly in longstanding cases but also in the early stages of the disease, even in patients without sensory symptoms or signs, and were reversible in some patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cortical response was also abnormal in some cases but the two were not always affected together </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In Friedreich's <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> both the cervical and cortical responses were usually abnormal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subclinical abnormalities of the cervical responses were found in some patients with hereditary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002313'>spastic paraparesis</z:hpo> or mixed forms of spinocerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cervical responses were also abnormal in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0009830'>peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0742186" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cervical radiculopathy</z:e>, and in some patients with brain-stem or thalamic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cervical and cortical responses were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lateral medullary syndrome</z:e>, whereas the cortical response was markedly abnormal in patients with high brain-stem or cerebral hemisphere vascular lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cortical and subcortical responses were abnormal in some patients with stereotactic thalamic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Enhanced cortical responses were found in patients with lesions at different levels in the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The most marked enhancement was observed in patients with familial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014550" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myoclonic epilepsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Lesser degrees were found in some patients with MS, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038868" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PSNP1">progressive supranuclear palsy</z:e>, thalamic lesions, brain-stem <z:hpo ids='HP_0002383'>encephalitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003396'>syringomyelia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Enhanced responses were usually found in patients with minimal or no clinical sensory involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It is postulated that this type of abnormality results from an interference to the inhibitory mechanisms which normally operate at various levels in the somatosensory pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that evoked potential studies are a valuable adjunct to the clinical evaluation of sensation, and that they may provide useful information on the pathophysiology of conduction in the somatosensory pathway </plain></SENT>
