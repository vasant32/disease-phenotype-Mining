<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Several studies have suggested that autonomic neural control plays a role in regulation of cerebral blood flow (CBF), although the exact role of the sympathetic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system on CBF remains debated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effects of sympathetic innervation on activity-induced cerebral perfusion changes in humans have not been studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aims of this study were therefore (a) to investigate patients with an "intrinsic" sympathetic deficit after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and healthy controls with regard to activity-induced cerebral perfusion changes, and (b) to investigate possible differences in functional CBF regulation between the anterior and posterior circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow velocity in the medial cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) and posterior cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>) was investigated in 21 healthy controls and 17 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wallenberg's syndrome</z:e> using transcranial Doppler sonography during cortical activation of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> territories, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with a central sympathetic deficit had a prolonged decrease of resistance in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> and showed a slower and less pronounced decrease of resistance in the <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> upon cortical activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No difference was observed between the side with and without sympathetic deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results suggest that (a) sympathetic efferents are involved in economisation of activity-induced changes of cerebral perfusion in the anterior circulation, (b) activity-induced sympathetic regulation of blood flow differs between the anterior and posterior vascular territories in humans and (c) a possible resting sympathetic tonus on extraparenchymal vessel might exist in the posterior circulation </plain></SENT>
