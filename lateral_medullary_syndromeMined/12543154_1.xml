<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Visually induced eye movements were investigated in 26 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wallenberg's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Slow-phase optokinetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000639'>nystagmus</z:hpo> (OKN) velocities, pursuit gains, and percentage fixation suppression (%FS) of caloric <z:hpo ids='HP_0000639'>nystagmus</z:hpo> were recorded by DC electrooculography (EOG), and stored directly onto FM magnetic tape </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: OKN velocities, pursuit gains, and %FS decreased toward the lesion side (group A), whereas OKN velocities and pursuit gains decreased toward the side contralateral to the lesion side. %FS decreased toward the lesion side (group B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images in group A showed that lesions were only in and near to the vestibular nuclei, and images in group B showed that lesions extended to the cerebellum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Visually guided eye movements allow classification of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wallenberg's syndrome</z:e> into two types, one with brainstem lesions and one with both brainstem and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0742035" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebellar lesions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This demonstrates that assessing eye movements is helpful in supplementing MRI data </plain></SENT>
