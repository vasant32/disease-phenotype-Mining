<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We reported here a 64-year-old man with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002871'>central apnea</z:hpo> resulted from unilateral medullary infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>He was admitted because of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>cerebellar ataxia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001260'>dysarthria</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002357'>dysphasia</z:hpo> of abrupt <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After the injection of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="49575">diazepam</z:chebi> for alcohol forbidden syndrome, he induced complete <z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apnea</z:hpo> and required the endotracheal intubation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At the spontaneous respiration under room air, his arterial blood gas showed hypercapnea without hypoxemia, and he fell into severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002791'>hypoventilation</z:hpo> when hypnotic drug was injected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Respisomnogram revealed the frequent presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002871'>central apnea</z:hpo> both while he was awake and asleep </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MRI demonstrated an abnormal high intensity area on T2 weighted image at the right lateral medulla just below the ponto-medullary junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At autopsy, areas of the infarction were limited within the right lateral medulla, including lateral portion of the medullary reticular formation, the ambigual nucleus, one part of the solitary nuclear complex, the inferior cerebellar peduncle and the spinal trigeminal nucleus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the dorsomotor nucleus of vagus was completely free from the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no other lesion within central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Such a distribution seemed the minimal extent of the lesion responsible for central, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apnea</z:hpo> compared to the previous reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002871'>central apnea</z:hpo> occurs not infrequently in the cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wallenberg's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
