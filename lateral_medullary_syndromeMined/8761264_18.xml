<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Neurophysiological characterization of the lesion in WS has been known for a long time, but there are no studies on the possible correlation between lesion topography and neurophysiological deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Assuming that afferents from the three branches of the trigeminal nerve reach different parts of the trigeminal nuclei, we examined the possible correlation between the lesion topography assessed by the MRI and the neurophysiological deficit, assessed by studying the brain stem reflexes in patients with WS within 2 weeks after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001311'>Neurophysiological abnormalities</z:hpo> were always located in the afferent branch of the reflexes examined, but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients exhibited abnormalities in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The ophthalmic branch was involved in 92.8% of patients, and the mandibular branch in 57.1% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patients with MRI lesions located in the lower medulla had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> responses with infraorbital or mental nerve stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results of this neurophysiological study confirm the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of WS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Whether the neurophysiological identification of different subgoups of patients is relevant for clinical outcome needs further studies </plain></SENT>
