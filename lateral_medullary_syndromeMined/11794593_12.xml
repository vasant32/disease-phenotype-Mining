<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) is known to be very variable, and some of its anatomical variations can explain ischemic complications that occur during endovascular treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors report two cases of anatomical variation of the PICA that they have called its double origin, one of which gave rise to an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The first patient was a 36-year-old man who presented with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> related to the rupture of a PICA <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was treated by the endovascular route </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Selective and superselective studies showed that the PICA origin was low on the fourth segment of the vertebral artery (VA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was located on an anastomosis between the PICA and a small upper arterial branch originating from the VA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Embolization was performed through the small branch with no problem, but a lateral medullary <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> followed, probably due to occlusion of the perforating vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The same anatomical variation was incidentally discovered in the second patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>To the authors' knowledge, neither this anatomical variation of the PICA nor the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>'s topography have been previously described angiographically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This highlights the role of angiography in pretreatment evaluation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> especially when perforating vessels or small accessory branches that are poorly visualized on angiographic studies are concerned, as in the territory of the PICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>Anatomy</z:mp> is sometimes unpredictable, and the surgeon must be very careful when confronted with these variations because they are potentially dangerous for endovascular treatment </plain></SENT>
