<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> results were analysed quantitatively using a computer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 16 out of 18 patients, OKN slow-phase velocities were impaired, in the remaining 2 patients they were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients who showed impaired OKN were classified into two groups according to directional asymmetry of OKN impairment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 7 out of the 16 patients, slow-phases toward the lesion side were predominantly impaired in contrast to the slow-phases toward the intact side (group A) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the remaining 9 patients, slow-phases toward the intact side were predominantly impaired (group B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The smooth pursuit showed the same asymmetry as the OKN slow-phase, except, in 4 patients who showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> smooth pursuit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients showed reduced visual suppression of caloric <z:hpo ids='HP_0000639'>nystagmus</z:hpo> during the slow-phase of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000639'>nystagmus</z:hpo> toward the lesion side, except 3 patients who showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> visual suppression in both directions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CT scan failed to detect either the brainstem or the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0742035" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebellar lesions</z:e> in any cases, but MRI performed on the most recent cases demonstrated the infarctions clearly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that infarctions are localized in the medulla in the patients of group A, but extend to the cerebellum as well as to the medulla in patients of group B </plain></SENT>
