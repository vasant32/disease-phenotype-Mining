<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It was associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the vertebral arteries which had caused a left <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wallenberg syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The left limb of the fenestration presenting the same transverse diameter as that of the remaining part of the basilar artery appeared to be its direct (true) origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The right limb had a lesser transverse diameter and appeared to bridge the lateral surface of the rostral end of the right vertebral artery and the basilar trunk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>According to the authors, this fenestration could have been caused by the persistence of the cranial part of a primitive lateral vertebrobasilar anastomosis, rather then by the usual incomplete fusion of the primitive paired basilar arteries </plain></SENT>
