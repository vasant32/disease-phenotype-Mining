<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>When asked to look at spontaneously appearing targets, saccades to the left were generally accurate but those to the right reached the target by multiple step refixation saccades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Large amplitude rightward saccades were possible between two continuously visible targets or when making voluntary saccades in the dark </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Vertical saccades, up or down, between spontaneously appearing targets were always associated with a leftward eye movement (lateropulsion) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Voluntary vertical saccades between continuously visible targets showed that upward movements had left lateropulsion but downward movements were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Vertical voluntary saccades in the dark were oblique, upward saccades showing left lateropulsion and downward saccades rightward deviation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The aberrant horizontal components of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> oblique saccades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Possibly impaired assessment of verticality with incorrect eye position information produced by the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> accounts for the lateropulsion in saccades in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wallenberg's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
