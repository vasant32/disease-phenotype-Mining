<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistulas</z:mpath> were located at C1-C2 in 45%, C2-C3 in 25%, C4-C5 in 15%, C5-C6 in 10%, and C6-C7 in 5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Trauma was the most common cause: 30% followed knife wounds, 20% followed gunshot injuries, and 10% followed blunt trauma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eight patients had spontaneous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistulas</z:mpath>, two associated with fibromuscular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three patients-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> with large, long-standing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistulas</z:mpath>-developed neurologic deficits coincident with the abrupt closure of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath>, which resolved with reestablishment of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two of these patients were treated by staged closure; the other one by gradual closure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three cases the result was complete <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> closure without neurologic sequelae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The remaining spontaneous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistulas</z:mpath> were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> closed by balloon embolization with preservation of the vertebral artery and without deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The six patients with traumatic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistulas</z:mpath> without transection were cured by balloon embolization, without deficits; in four there was also preservation of vertebral flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The other six patients had traumatic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistulas</z:mpath> with transection and were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cured by balloon embolization with preservation of flow in two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Four patients required bilateral approaches to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> to achieve complete <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> closure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The only complication was a mild residual <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wallenberg syndrome</z:e> after occlusion of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery in the treatment of a transection located at C1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In our opinion, transvascular techniques are the treatment of choice for vertebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0004947'>arteriovenous fistulas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
