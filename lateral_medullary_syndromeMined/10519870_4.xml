<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Electronically matched <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> lesions superimposed to an anatomical atlas show the suspected course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifteen patients with infarction of the lower brainstem, MRI lesions and electrically elicited blink reflexes were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The involved structures in patients with R2 and R2c blink reflex changes were identified by biplane high resolution MRI with individual slices matched to an anatomical atlas at 10 different levels using digital postprocessing methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The blink reflexes were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in five of 15 patients (33%) and showed loss or delay of R2 and R2c to stimulation ipsilaterally to lesion (R2-i and R2c-i) in eight (53%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Loss or delay of R2-i/R2c-i was seen in lesions covering the entire trigeminal spinal tract and nucleus (TSTN) at at least one level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These infarctions were located more dorsally within the medulla </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> blink reflexes showed lesions sparing or involving the TSTN only partially </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>They more often had incomplete <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wallenberg's syndromes</z:e> and MRI lesions were located more ventrally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Using digital postprocessing MRI methods it was possible to identify central pathways of late blink reflex in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wallenberg's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This method is suggested as a new approach to identify incompletely understood functional structures of the brainstem </plain></SENT>
