<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It may show as psychological or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0683324" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">organic disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The main causes are lesions of the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system and of the sensorial organs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0000738'>hallucination</z:hpo> may present with or without critical perception but always appears to be a real experience </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL CASE: We describe four patients diagnosed as having <z:hpo ids='HP_0000738'>hallucinations</z:hpo> secondary to known lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The first two had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002367'>visual hallucinations</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e>, the first in the dorso-lateral region of the medulla oblongata and the second in the left parietal lobe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The other two had peripheral sensorial defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The third patient had simultaneously an ophthalmic disorder and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002367'>visual hallucinations</z:hpo>, and the fourth had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> hypoacusia and <z:hpo ids='HP_0008765'>auditory hallucinations</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> showed structured sensorial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000738'>hallucinations</z:hpo> with critical appraisal of these <z:hpo ids='HP_0000738'>hallucinations</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this paper we review the pathogenesis of the organic hallucinatory state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The main mechanisms are proposed: by means of liberation (destruction of inhibitory structures) and by means of irritation (anomolous excitation of cerebral structures) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Also we point out the difference between a <z:hpo ids='HP_0000738'>hallucination</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000708'>psychiatric disorders</z:hpo>, mainly in three aspects: presence of the known organic lesion, critical appraisal of the perception in spite of it appearing as real to the patient, and the absence of associated psychiatric pathology </plain></SENT>
