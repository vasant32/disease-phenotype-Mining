<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Unilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001751'>vestibular dysfunction</z:hpo> represents either vestibular overactivity as benign positional <z:hpo ids='HP_0002321'>vertigo</z:hpo> or underactivity as in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022893" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">labyrinthitis</z:e> or both, at different times, as in a Ménière's attack </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Unilateral dysfunction could also be central rather than peripheral, such as in a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lateral medullary syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Unilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001751'>vestibular dysfunction</z:hpo> could affect any of the five different sensory areas in the labyrinth, the three semicircular canals and the two otoliths, or their brainstem connections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For rigorous diagnosis of the cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002321'>vertigo</z:hpo>, ideally one would have robust, reproducible, quantitative vestibular function tests sensitive to dysfunction of each of the five sensory regions in each ear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In working towards this ideal we have, over the last 15 years, developed three new vestibular function tests: (1) impulsive tests of individual semicircular canal function, (2) evoked potential tests of saccular function and (3) subjective visual horizontal tests of utricular function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The physiological rationale of these three tests is reviewed as well as the interpretation of their results in various diseases </plain></SENT>
