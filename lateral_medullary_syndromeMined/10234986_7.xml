<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The surgical therapy of these <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> is complex and difficult due to the close topographical relationship between the neurovascular structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we report upon 27 patients with 29 such <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of these, 22 patients (81%) were hospitalized because of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sixteen of these patients (72%) had an additional <z:mp ids='MP_0001917'>intraventricular hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one patients (78%) were surgically treated for their <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, three of them also for an associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>Aneurysms</z:hpo> of the VA and the proximal PICA were exposed via a transcondylar (n = 11) or lateral suboccipital (n = 3) approach, those originating from the distal PICA via a paramedian suboccipital (n = 7) route </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Endovascular therapy was used in three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A patient with a fusiform <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the vertebrobasilar junction was treated with a ventriculoperitoneal shunt only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> with a complex <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> were not treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of the patients operated upon, two died postoperatively due to vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Two other patients developed an incomplete <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dorsolateral medullary syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>One individual was lost for follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up period was 4.6 years (range 3-86 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Both, the overall mortality (2/27) and morbidity (2/27) were 7.5%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Our results show that even complex vascular lesions of the posterior fossa can be treated with a satisfactory long-term outcome in the majority of our patients (85%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The multimodal management and an individually tailored microsurgical approach are key issues for the treatment of such <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
