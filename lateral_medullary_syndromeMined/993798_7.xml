<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Findings in this study and data obtained in 30 patients suffering from trigeminal (26) and facial (four) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0847483" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">nerve lesions</z:e> suggest that the silent period evoked according to our methods is cutaneous in origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The trigeminal sensory root forms the afferent limb of the silent period reflex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Its central pathway is thought to pass both crossed and uncrossed through the pons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Determination of the cutaneous silent period might be of value for the demonstration of trigeminal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0847483" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">nerve lesions</z:e> and to supplement results concerning other brain-stem reflexes </plain></SENT>
