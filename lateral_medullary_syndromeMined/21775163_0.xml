<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In order to clarify the laryngeal sensation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001283'>bulbar palsy</z:hpo> patients, we studied the relationship between laryngopharyngeal sensation and brainstem lesion in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> caused by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001283'>bulbar palsy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifteen patients with lateral medullary infarction and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed laryngeal sensory test using the flexible laryngoscope and probes method previously developed by Yaguchi et al </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The test sites included the right and left tip of the laryngeal surface of the epiglottis and bilateral arytenoid regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lesion sites were identified by magnetic resonance imaging and classified horizontally according to Kim's classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also used the anatomical atlas Cytoarchitecture of the Human Brain Stem to determine whether the lesions included the nucleus solitarius and nucleus ambiguus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eight cases had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> sensation and 7 cases had decreased sensation of the affected side of the epiglottis and arytenoid region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The lesions of decreased laryngeal sensation group were classified horizontally as large type or dorsal type and included the nucleus solitarius </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Decreased laryngeal sensation was significantly correlated with lesions that included the nucleus solitarius (Fisher exact test; P = .026) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study clarifies that patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> caused by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001283'>bulbar palsy</z:hpo> may present with laryngeal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003474'>sensory impairment</z:hpo> of the affected side and laryngopharyngeal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100022'>movement disorder</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The important finding is that damage to both the nucleus solitarius and ambiguus cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> accompanied by decreased laryngeal sensation and that the lesions are relatively extensive and affect the middle level of the dorsal medulla </plain></SENT>
