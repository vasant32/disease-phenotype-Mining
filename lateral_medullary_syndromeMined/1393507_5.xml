<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Saccadic eye movements and the adaptive control of their amplitudes were examined in patients with Wallenberg's <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lateral medullary syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Half of the patients had permanent saccadic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001310'>dysmetria</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Their primary saccades had asymmetric amplitudes: those made in response to an ipsilateral target step (i.e. to the lesion side) tended to be hypermetric and saccades made in response to a contralateral target step were strongly hypometric </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multiple correction saccades were needed for target fixation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The adjustment of the amplitude of artificially induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0007338'>hypermetric saccades</z:hpo>, called gain adaptivity, was examined experimentally by using double target steps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The first target step elicited the primary saccade which triggered a further target displacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This second, intra-saccadic target displacement was opposite to the first target step and caused the primary saccade to overshoot the final target position </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In this way a post-saccadic target position error was generated which had to be corrected for foveal fixation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>With repetition of this stimulus sequence the saccadic control system of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects made an adjustment in amplitude of the main saccade such that the overshooting gradually diminished </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After a few hundred trials primary saccades became orthometric with respect to the final target position; in respect to the first target step they were, however, strongly hypometric </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The experimental data show that patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wallenberg's syndrome</z:e> had a reduced capability to readjust saccadic amplitude </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This observation together with the enduring saccadic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001310'>dysmetria</z:hpo> suggest that adaptive gain control of saccades is impaired in patients with lesions restricted to the dorsolateral medulla </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It is speculated that these lesions most likely disrupt olivo-cerebellar pathways which are believed to be of paramount importance in visuo-motor adaptation of the cerebellum </plain></SENT>
