<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 51-year-old woman with BS had a sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wallenberg syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three days after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, she was transferred to our institute </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study on admission, T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images showed a high intensity area in the left paramedian region of the medulla oblongata </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images showed enhancement in the vessel wall of the left vertebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We diagnosed her as having <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wallenberg syndrome</z:e> due to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> vertebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0012089'>arteritis</z:hpo> associated with BS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After initiation of high-dose steroid therapy, her symptoms gradually improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two months after admission, she was discharged from our institute with mild hemihypesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that vertebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0012089'>arteritis</z:hpo> due to BS had caused hypoperfusion of the medullary perforators causing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wallenberg syndrome</z:e> in our patient </plain></SENT>
