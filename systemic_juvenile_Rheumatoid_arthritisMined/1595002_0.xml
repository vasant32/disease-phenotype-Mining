<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fifty four per cent of patients had mono-cyclic systemic type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> ranged from 6.0-6.8 years (median 6.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Boys were more affected than girls (24/11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cardiac involvement occurred in 10 patients (27%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with cardiac troubles showed significantly much number of the white blood cell counts at admission and the max white blood cell count than those without cardiac troubles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Duration of positive CRP was shorter in patients with cardiac involvement who were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> given cortico-steroid hormone those without cardiac involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This means that it is better to use steroid hormone early for patients with cardiac involvement </plain></SENT>
