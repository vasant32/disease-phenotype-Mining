<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The records of 100 children presenting with systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0005681'>juvenile rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> were studied retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The precocity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and intensity of initial extra-articular signs did not seem to be correlated with a more severe outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003864" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arthritides</z:e> present during the first 6 months seemed to be associated with a different prognosis: the oligo- or abarticular forms generally had a better prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In girls, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> was earlier and remissions were twice more frequent than in boys </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Contrary to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other joints, the hip was susceptible of a radiological improvement in 25% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Joint disabilities, especially of the wrist, were initially related to <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and pain; secondarily, they were chiefly related to the anatomic evolution, resulting in fusion of the joint spaces </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At the last clinical examination after a 10 year's evolution, half of patients were in clinical remission, either without articular sequellae, with sequellae, the most severe of which being the hip involvement; 25% of patients still had systemic symptoms; 25% presented with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162323" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">polyarthritis</z:e> with persisting biological and articular inflammatory signs </plain></SENT>
