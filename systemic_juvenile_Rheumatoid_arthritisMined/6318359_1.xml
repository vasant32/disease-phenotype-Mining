<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Follow-up was at least three years in 83 cases, 7 years in 72 of them and 12 years in 20 of them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were included in the study if they experienced high grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0001954'>intermittent fever</z:hpo> for at least two weeks at any time during the course of their disease: thus, patients with delayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> were eligible whatever the time-interval between <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the disease and occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the study was, indeed, to determine the articular prognosis of the disease according to the overall course rather than to features at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overall results show that clinical involvement of joints occur in the following order: knee 98%, ankle 81%, wrist 77%, cervical spine 70%, elbow 66%, hand 56%, hip 45%, shoulder 29%, foot 10% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, radiologic changes in the temporomandibulary joint are fairly common: 46% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Estimation of these incidences was done 7 years at least after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An analytical study was carried out for four joints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At the wrist, very significant findings are regression of inflammatory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> (77% before 3 years, 67% after 7 years), progression of bone destruction (19% before 3 years, 67% after 7 years) and stability of permanent stiffness (56% before 3 years, 60% after 7 years) due initially to <z:mp ids='MP_0002933'>joint inflammation</z:mp> and subsequently to osseous and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0332791" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">fibrous ankylosis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The hip is involved in more than 60% of cases with replacement arthroplasty being considered because of the severity of radiologic destruction in 8% of cases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
