<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To study the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001928'>coagulation abnormalities</z:hpo> in children with systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0005681'>juvenile rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JRA</z:e>) using a sensitive marker of fibrin degradation, and to determine whether serial levels of this variable parallel disease activity or predict response to medications in this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Levels of d-dimer were determined in 24 consecutive patients with systemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JRA</z:e> in conjunction with complete blood counts, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, maximum <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, duration of morning stiffness, and swollen joint count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serial levels were then obtained in 11 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Linear regression analyses were done to determine any correlations between d-dimer and the other variables; and paired t test was used to compare levels before and after treatment interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Levels of d-dimer were also compared against concurrent clinical events such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001701'>pericarditis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Elevated levels of d-dimer were found in 23/24 of the patients (96%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When serial levels were analyzed, there were correlations between levels of d-dimer and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> (p = 0.03) and total leukocyte count (p = 0.04), but not with other variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a significant reduction in levels before and after treatment in patients deemed to be clinical responders to immunomodulatory agents (p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Elevated levels were also indicative of severe disease over the remainder of followup; lack of d-dimer indicated a benign disease course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: With the use of a sensitive and specific marker of fibrinolysis known as d-dimer, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001928'>coagulation abnormalities</z:hpo> were more prevalent in children with systemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JRA</z:e> than previously reported, and are frequently found during periods of active disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, serial levels of d-dimer appear to parallel response to disease modifying agents, and may predict outcome over a short followup period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Fibrin d-dimer may represent a novel marker that, when used in combination with known variables, could enhance that assessment of disease activity and response to medications in children with systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JRA</z:e> </plain></SENT>
