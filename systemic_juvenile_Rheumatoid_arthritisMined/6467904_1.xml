<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SAA was found in similar quantities in the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">high density lipoprotein</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>) fraction of serum from a patient suffering from systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0005681'>juvenile rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JRA</z:e>) and mink stimulated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi> (LPS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Only very small quantities were present in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human controls and not detectable in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mink </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Striking similarities were found in molecular weight, isoelectric point and degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> for human and mink SAA, while immunologic cross-reactivity between the two species was not found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast to human <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi>, mink <z:chebi fb="17" ids="39025">HDL</z:chebi> was found not to contain apoA-II and only minute amounts of apoC proteins </plain></SENT>
