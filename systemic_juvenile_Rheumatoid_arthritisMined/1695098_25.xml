<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In view of the successful treatment of these diseases, we initiated a pilot study of the effect of IV gamma globulin in systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0005681'>juvenile rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JRA</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eight patients with active systemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JRA</z:e> that was unresponsive to first-line agents, second-line agents, and/or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> received this therapy monthly for 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Outcome measures included changes in articular and extraarticular features, steroid dosage, and laboratory parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Following IV gamma globulin therapy, there was significant improvement in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> and/or morning stiffness in 5 of 8 patients, while extraarticular features significantly improved in 7 of 8 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At study entry, 6 of 8 patients were receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi>; at study end, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> was discontinued in 3 patients and decreased by more than 50% in the other 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall, there was an 80% reduction in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> dosage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Initially, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, low levels of serum albumin, and an <z:hpo ids='HP_0003565'>elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate</z:hpo>, while a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001894'>thrombocytosis</z:hpo> was seen in 7 of 8 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Serum IgG was initially elevated in 6 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>IV gamma globulin therapy resulted in a significant increase in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> and albumin levels and a significant decrease in the mean serum IgG level, platelet count, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In only 1 patient did IV gamma globulin fail to significantly improve the clinical or laboratory features of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We suggest that this therapy may be beneficial in the treatment of systemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JRA</z:e> </plain></SENT>
