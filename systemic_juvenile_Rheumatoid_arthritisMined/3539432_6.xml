<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The numbers of peripheral T lymphocytes and their helper/inducer and cytotoxic/suppressor subpopulation were within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Activated T lymphocytes (DR+) were slightly increased but not at statistically significant levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast to the T cells, B lymphocytes were increased; both the percentage of B cells (B1+) and the number of cells spontaneously secreting IgG, IgA, and IgM were increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Stimulation of peripheral mononuclear cells in vitro with pokeweed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi> induced poor plaque-forming cell responses, which were partially improved upon removal of monocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The presence of concanavalin A in the cultures led to complete suppression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that patients with systemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JRA</z:e> are characterized primarily by B-cell rather than <z:mp ids='MP_0008037'>T-cell abnormalities</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
