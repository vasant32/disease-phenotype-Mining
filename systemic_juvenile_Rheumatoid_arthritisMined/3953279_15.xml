<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At diagnosis, during <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, the concentration was extremely high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The median value was 935 micrograms/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The values were unrelated to other manifestations of the disease or laboratory findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoid</z:chebi> treatment, the serum ferritin concentrations normalized rapidly, usually within a few weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The rate of normalization reflected the response of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> to treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Later, subnormal concentrations were found, which were unrelated to the activity of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, serum ferritin is a useful guide when tapering <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoid</z:chebi> dosage </plain></SENT>
