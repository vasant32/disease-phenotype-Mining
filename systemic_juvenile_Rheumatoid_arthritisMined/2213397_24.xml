<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Twenty-nine children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005681'>juvenile rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> were studied to determine the safety and efficacy of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The initial dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> averaged 7.1 mg/m2/wk and was given as a single, oral weekly dose or as three divided doses, each separated by 12 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Current antiinflammatory medications were continued; 25 of 29 children had had lack of efficacy, and 8 of 29 had toxic effects, with one or more prior drugs such as intramuscularly or orally administered gold, hydroxychloroquine, or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7959">D-penicillamine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intolerable <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> dependency or toxic effects were present in 18 of 29 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">Methotrexate</z:chebi>-treated patients were examined monthly; minimum treatment duration required to assess efficacy and toxicity was 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The range of treatment duration was 8 to 39 months (mean 18.5 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Efficacy was assessed by comparing pretreatment versus posttreatment <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015230" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rash</z:e>, swollen-joint counts, articular indexes, duration of morning stiffness, functional class, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> levels, and platelet counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> effectively controlled <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015230" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rash</z:e> in 83% of children with systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0005681'>juvenile rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo>, reduced morning stiffness by 63%, eliminated recalcitrant joint restriction in 48%, and reduced numbers of swollen joints and swelling indexes by 46% and 52%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant toxic effects were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0005681'>Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> of long duration, or with major <z:mpath ids='MPATH_580'>erosions</z:mpath>, was more likely to be refractory to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We recommend earlier consideration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> in place of other slow-acting <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35842">antirheumatic drugs</z:chebi> for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005681'>juvenile rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> not responding well to usual therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Future studies should address potential <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> toxic effects in the lungs and reproductive system, as well as outcome after discontinuation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
