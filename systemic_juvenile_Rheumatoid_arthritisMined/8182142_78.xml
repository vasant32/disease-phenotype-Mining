<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>By using a sandwich ELISA, soluble human IL-6 receptor (sIL-6 R) levels were measured in the sera of 20 healthy children and of 25 patients with systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0005681'>juvenile rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JRA</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In patients with systemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JRA</z:e>, serum sIL-6 R levels (114.6 +/- 37.7 ng/ml) were significantly lower (P &lt; 0.01) than those of healthy children (161.2 +/- 45.5 ng/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serum sIL-6 R levels were negatively correlated (r = -0.610, P &lt; 0.001) with serum IL-6 levels measured with the B9 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The serum IL-6/sIL-6 R complex was detected using an ELISA based on a monoclonal antibody to IL-6 for capture and on a monoclonal antibody to human sIL-6 R for detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Healthy controls had little, if any, detectable serum IL-6/sIL-6 R complex (OD 0.024 +/- 0.027), while the majority of patients with systemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JRA</z:e> presented measurable serum IL-6/sIL-6 R complex (OD 0.492 +/- 0.546) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>IL-6 levels estimated in the circulating IL-6/sIL-6 R complexes were in the range of nanograms per milliliter and approximately 20-fold higher than those measured by the B9 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Since serum C-reactive protein concentrations were much more correlated with serum levels of IL-6/sIL-6 R complexes (r = 0.713, r2 = 0.51, P &lt; 0.0001) than with the serum IL-6 levels measured with the B9 cells (r = 0.435, r2 = 0.19, P = 0.05), the large quantities of serum IL-6 present in IL-6/sIL-6 R complexes appear to be biologically relevant in vivo, at least as far as the induction by IL-6 of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase protein production </plain></SENT>
