<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy and safety of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005681'>juvenile rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JRA</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-one children with active, refractory, systemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JRA</z:e> were randomized into a multicentered, double blinded, placebo controlled trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients received infusions of 1.5 g/kg of IVIG or placebo (0.1% albumin) every 2 weeks for 2 months, then monthly for 4 months (total: up to 9 infusions over 6 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-nine of the 31 patients were included in the efficacy subset </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fourteen patients discontinued prematurely from study, 7 in each treatment group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A higher proportion of patients in the IVIG group improved (50 vs 27%) as assessed by the physician's global assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the sample size was small and this difference was not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>IVIG was not more effective than placebo in reducing the number of days with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> or other systemic manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Changes from baseline in the joint count, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>, albumin, platelet count, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate did not differ between treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that high dose IVIG has limited clinical utility in systemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JRA</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, this trial failed to enroll adequate numbers of patients to permit valid statistical intergroup comparisons, and the results must be considered nondefinitive </plain></SENT>
