<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the mechanism(s) of action remains to be delineated, immune globulin therapy has been shown to be effective in some antibody-mediated disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In Rh disease, antibody-induced cytopenias, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003473'>myasthenia</z:hpo> gravis, and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005779" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">clotting disorder</z:e> associated with anti-factor VIII antibody, intravenous immune globulin has had therapeutic benefit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It was of interest that intravenous immune globulin may partially ameliorate the tendency toward dilation of the coronary vessels in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026691" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MLNS|MCLS">Kawasaki disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="?"><plain>If this disorder represents a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> of the small feeding vessels of the coronary arteries, could this agent influence other forms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0262428" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">collagen vascular disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pilot studies in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011633" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dermatomyositis</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085655" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">polymyositis</z:e> and systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0005681'>juvenile rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> indicate benefit from intravenous immune globulin therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In these studies we used a high-dose protocol consisting of 1 gm/kg/day of immune globulin for 2 days every 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In patients with either <z:hpo ids='HP_0100614'>myositis</z:hpo> or systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0005681'>juvenile rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo>, beneficial effects were seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the former group of patients, increased proximal muscle strength and reduction in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> kinase levels were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the latter group of patients a marked reduction in systemic features was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The amount of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> required was reduced in both groups of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These studies indicate the potential for intravenous immune globulin in collagen <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disorders</z:e> and the need for carefully controlled trials of this form of therapy </plain></SENT>
