<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To study polymorphisms in the 5'-flanking promoter/enhancer region of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor alpha (TNFalpha) gene and in the coding regions of HLA class I and class II genes, in order to better understand the genetic background of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005681'>juvenile rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JRA</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred eleven Japanese <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JRA</z:e> patients (50 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442893" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">systemic disease</z:e>, 29 with pauciarticular disease, and 32 with polyarticular disease) and 575 healthy Japanese subjects were examined for the allele frequencies of the TNFalpha, HLA-A, and HLA class II (DRB1, DRB3, DRB4, DRB5, DQA1, DQB1, DPA1, and DPB1) genes, by DNA typing using the polymerase chain reaction-sequence-specific oligonucleotide probe method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The frequencies of the polymorphic allele at positions -1,031 (T to C substitution, termed -1,031C), -863 (C to A, termed -863A), and -857 (C to T, termed -857T) of the TNFalpha gene in patients with systemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JRA</z:e>, but not in those with polyarticular or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0157917" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pauciarticular JRA</z:e>, were significantly higher than in the healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The allele frequencies of DRB1*0405 and DQB1*0401 in systemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JRA</z:e>, but not in the other <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JRA</z:e> types, were significantly higher than in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Linkage analysis showed that the presence of both the TNFalpha -857T allele and DRB1*0405 yielded a significantly increased odds ratio (3.84), while the presence of only 1 of them did not yield a high odds ratio (0.87 and 1.58) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The -1,031C/-863A allele and the -857T allele of the TNFalpha gene, both of which are related to high production of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor alpha, are associated with systemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JRA</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The -857T allele may enhance the effect of the DRB1*0405/DQB1*0401 haplotype in predisposing to development of systemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JRA</z:e> </plain></SENT>
