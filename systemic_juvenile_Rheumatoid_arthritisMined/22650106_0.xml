<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>Lymphadenopathy</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000952'>jaundice</z:hpo> and neurological symptoms mayalsooccur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>HLH may ensue in various forms of innate or acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> with impaired cytotoxic lymphocyte function resulting in excessive macrophage activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To describe and analyse clinical characteristics of patients treated for HLH at the University Children's Hospital of Belgrade from August 2000 to August 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Retrospective analysis of medical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Diagnosis of HLH was established in 13 children (five boys and eight girls) aged from one month to 14 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In six children HLH was secondary (to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023290" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">visceral leishmaniasis</z:e> in two, Ebstein-Barr <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042769" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">virus infection</z:e> in one, Langerhans' cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_146,MPATH_652'>histiocytosis</z:mpath> in one and systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0005681'>juvenile rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> in two) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the remaining seven patients, genes for perforin and syntaxin 11 were examined in two and no mutations were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the remaining seven patients, genes encoding perforin and syntaxin 11 were analyzed in two, but no mutations were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> children had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001744'>splenomegaly</z:hpo>, cytopoenias, hyperferritinaemia and hypertriglyceridaemia, but <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0876991" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">haemophagocytosis</z:e> was seen in only six (46.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Six children were cured (four with secondary HLH and two with primary HLH).Two children are undergoing treatment, while five succumbed (three before treatment could be administered and two due to complications) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In four of the six cured children, HLH arose in the first year of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Cure rate in those who underwent haematopoietic stem cell transplantation was 2/3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Results underscore the importance of timely diagnosis and treatment of HLH, warranting that in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001744'>splenomegaly</z:hpo> and/or cytopoenias, with or without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0876991" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">haemophagocytosis</z:e>, HLH be actively sought </plain></SENT>
