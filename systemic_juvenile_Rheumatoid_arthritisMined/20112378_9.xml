<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To describe mortality rates, causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, and potential mortality risk factors in pediatric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035435" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rheumatic diseases</z:e> in the US </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used the Indianapolis Pediatric Rheumatology Disease Registry, which includes 49,023 patients from 62 centers who were newly diagnosed between 1992 and 2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Identifiers were matched with the Social Security <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>Death</z:hpo> Index censored for March 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>Deaths</z:hpo> were confirmed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> certificates, referring physicians, and medical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were derived by chart review or from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> certificate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After excluding patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e>, 110 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> among 48,885 patients (0.23%) were confirmed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients had been followed up for a mean +/- SD of 7.9 +/- 2.7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The SMR of the entire cohort was significantly decreased (0.65 [95% CI 0.53-0.78]), with differences in patients followed up for &gt; or =9 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The SMR was significantly greater for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (3.06 [95% CI 1.78-4.90]) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011633" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dermatomyositis</z:e> (2.64 [95% CI 0.86-6.17]) but not for systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0005681'>juvenile rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> (1.8 [95% CI 0.66-3.92]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The SMR was significantly decreased in pain syndromes (0.41 [95% CI 0.21-0.72]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were related to the rheumatic diagnosis (including complications) in 39 patients (35%), treatment complications in 11 (10%), non-natural causes in 25 (23%), background disease in 23 (21%), and were unknown in 12 patients (11%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Rheumatic diagnoses, age at diagnosis, sex, and early use of systemic steroids and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> were significantly associated with the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that the overall mortality rate for pediatric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035435" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rheumatic diseases</z:e> was not increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Even for the diseases and conditions associated with increased mortality, mortality rates were significantly lower than those reported in previous studies </plain></SENT>
