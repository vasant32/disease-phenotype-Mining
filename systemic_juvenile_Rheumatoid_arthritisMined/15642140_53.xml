<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096155" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Macrophage activation syndrome</z:e> (MAS) has been reported in association with many <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035435" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rheumatic diseases</z:e>, most commonly in systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0005681'>juvenile rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> (sJRA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinically, MAS is similar to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024291" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis</z:e> (HLH), a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic disorder</z:e> with absent or depressed natural killer (NK) function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have previously reported that, as in HLH, patients with MAS have profoundly decreased NK activity, suggesting that this abnormality might be relevant to the pathogenesis of the syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we examined the extent of NK dysfunction across the spectrum of diseases that comprise <z:hpo ids='HP_0005681'>juvenile rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JRA</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were collected from patients with pauciarticular (n = 4), polyarticular (n = 16), and systemic (n = 20) forms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JRA</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>NK cytolytic activity was measured after co-incubation of PBMC with the NK-sensitive K562 cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>NK cells (CD56+/T cell receptor [TCR]-alphabeta-), NK T cells (CD56+/TCR-alphabeta+), and CD8+ T cells were also assessed for perforin and granzyme B expression by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall, NK cytolytic activity was significantly lower in patients with sJRA than in other <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JRA</z:e> patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In a subgroup of patients with predominantly sJRA, NK cell activity was profoundly decreased: in 10 of 20 patients with sJRA and in only 1 of 20 patients with other <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JRA</z:e>, levels of NK activity were below two standard deviations of pediatric controls (P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Some decrease in perforin expression in NK cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes was seen in patients within each of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JRA</z:e> groups with no statistically significant differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was a profound decrease in the proportion of circulating CD56bright NK cells in three sJRA patients, a pattern similar to that previously observed in MAS and HLH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, a subgroup of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JRA</z:e> who have not yet had an episode of MAS showed decreased NK function and an absence of circulating CD56bright population, similar to the abnormalities observed in patients with MAS and HLH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This phenomenon was particularly common in the systemic form of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JRA</z:e>, a clinical entity strongly associated with MAS </plain></SENT>
