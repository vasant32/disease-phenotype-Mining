<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three patterns were found: patient 3 was resistant to Fas- and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46979">C2-ceramide</z:chebi>, patient 1 was resistant to Fas, but sensitive to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46979">C2-ceramide</z:chebi>, patient 2 was resistant to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46979">C2-ceramide</z:chebi>, but sensitive to Fas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By contrast, Fas- and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46979">C2-ceramide</z:chebi>-induced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in five children with systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0005681'>juvenile rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo>, five children with <z:mp ids='MP_0002056'>insulin-dependent diabetes</z:mp> and 10 age-matched healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Surface expression of Fas was low in patient 1, but <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in patients 2 and 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Together with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> Fas transcripts, patients 2 and 3 displayed a transcript 152 bp longer than the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> one retaining intron 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our data indicate that polyreactive autoimmune syndromes may be associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> alteration of the immune response switching-off system </plain></SENT>
