<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study we found that NSE/hIL-6 transgenic mouse lines expressing high levels of circulating IL-6 since early after birth presented a <z:mp ids='MP_0001732'>reduced growth rate</z:mp> that led to mice 50-70% the size of nontransgenic littermates </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In NSE/hIL-6 transgenic mice, circulating IGF-I levels were significantly lower than those of nontransgenic littermates; on the contrary, the distribution of growth hormone pituitary cells, as well as circulating growth hormone levels, were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treatment of nontransgenic mice of the same strain with IL-6 resulted in a significant decrease in IGF-I levels </plain></SENT>
