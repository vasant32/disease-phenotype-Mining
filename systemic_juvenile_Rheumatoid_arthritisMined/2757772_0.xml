<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Also the association of these autoantibodies with the activity stage of the illness was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were 14 pauciarticular, 8 polyarticular and 3 systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0005681'>juvenile rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twelve have a flare of the disease and 13 were completely asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rheumatoid factor measured by the latex agglutination tests was positive in 6 children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These included 2 patients with pauciarticular disease, showing titers below 1:40 and 4 cases with polyarticular disease, showing titers above 1:320 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One of these last patients developed and adult type <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> during her evolution and was treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7959">D-penicillamine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The polyarticular but not the pauciarticular patients showed positive tests for rheumatoid factor by nephelometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No definite association between these laboratory results and the activity of the disease was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0003493'>antinuclear antibodies</z:hpo> by the indirect immunofluorescence test were found in 3 pauciarticular and one polyarticular patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A predominant homogeneous staining was found with the mouse kidney substrate, whereas homogeneous and speckled patterns were noted with the homologous HEp-2 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One patient with persistent positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0003493'>antinuclear antibodies</z:hpo> revealed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Three of the 4 sera with positive antibodies by the indirect immunofluorescent test have also anti-nucleoprotein antibodies by the hemagglutination test with titers above 1:32.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
