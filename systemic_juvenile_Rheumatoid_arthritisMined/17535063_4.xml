<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JRA</z:e> patients (n = 21) who received etanercept in our rheumatology clinic over a 14-month period were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patient demo-graphics, type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo>, dosing regimens, family history, measures of joint function and laboratory parameters were obtained for each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A questionnaire that comprised validated functional assessment and quality-of-life measures (the Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire [CHAQtrade mark], the Juvenile <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>Arthritis</z:hpo> Function Assessment Report [JAFAR 5trade mark] and the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory Version 4 [PedsQL Generic Scaletrade mark] scales) was administered to patients and parents to assess physical and emotional function, pain, adverse drug events and quality of life at each clinic visit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Functional status and quality of life improved in patients with poly-articular and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442893" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">systemic disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A significant difference between pre- and post-etanercept functional assessment (JAFARtrade mark and CHAQtrade mark) and quality-of-life assessment by parents and patients was found (p = 0.009, p = 0.002, p &lt;/= 0.001, p &lt;/= 0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The JAFARtrade mark results concurred with those of the CHAQtrade mark test, and did not distinguish between patients with polyarticular and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442893" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">systemic disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Laboratory parameters indicative of toxicity did not differ between patients with polyarticular and systemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JRA</z:e> and the number of adverse events reported was low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Underlying disease did not appear to predict improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Etanercept appeared to improve functional status, emotional well-being, quality of life and activity level with minimal toxicity in patients with polyarticular and systemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">JRA</z:e> </plain></SENT>
