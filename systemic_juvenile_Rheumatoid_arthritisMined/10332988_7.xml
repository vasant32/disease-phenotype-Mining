<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the seasonal variability of SOJRA in Israel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A multicenter retrospective chart review of 59 patients with SOJRA, enrolled from 10 rheumatology units or pediatric departments in Israel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients met defined criteria of SOJRA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty-nine patients (31 female, 28 male) were followed from 1982 to 1997 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Their mean age was 7.1 +/- 4.3 years (range 0.9-16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Forty-six were Jewish and 13 were Arabs or of Bedouin origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eighteen patients (31%) had disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> in the winter, 16 (27%) in the spring, 12 (20%) in the summer, and 13 (22%) in the fall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twenty-eight patients had a monophasic disease subtype, while 31 had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> or cyclic subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The seasonal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> in the patients with the monophasic type versus the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> or the cyclic type shows 7 versus 11 in the winter, 7 versus 9 in spring, 8 versus 4 in summer, and 6 versus 7 in fall, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There is no seasonal pattern to SOJRA disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> in Israel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, the disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of patients having the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> or the polycyclic subtype tends to be more common in winter and spring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Since patients with this type have more severe disease, it is possible that another specific infectious agent is one of the factors involved in the pathogenesis of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Larger sampling and multicenter studies are required to clarify this point </plain></SENT>
