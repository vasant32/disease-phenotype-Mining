<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Detection of autoimmune regulator (AIRE) gene mutations facilitates timely and precise diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: AIRE mutation detection was performed in a cohort of 11 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two did not meet clinical APS-1 criteria and several started with atypical presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sequencing and TaqMan genotyping were used to identify AIRE mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Complete AIRE deletion was confirmed and framed by real-time PCR, long-range amplification and analysis of the microsatellite markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seven different mutations were detected, three were novel: c.892G&gt;A in exon 8, silent mutation c.462A&gt;T in exon 3 most likely affecting splicing, and a complete deletion of a single AIRE allele ((?_68)_(1567-14_?)del) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Novel (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0029877" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">otitis</z:e>) and rare (systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0005681'>juvenile rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo>, autoimmune <z:hpo ids='HP_0011950'>bronchiolitis</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e>) clinical presentations were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: AIRE mutation detection was valuable in the diagnostics of APS-1 in patients with atypical presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000389'>Chronic otitis media</z:hpo> possibly broadened the cluster of APS-1 manifestations </plain></SENT>
