<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>He underwent splenectomy and 3 years later he developed Coombs' positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001878'>hemolytic anemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001596'>alopecia</z:hpo>, juvenile <z:hpo ids='HP_0200043'>warts</z:hpo>, and multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At that time, investigations were compatible with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0004313'>hypogammaglobulinemia</z:hpo> associated with common variable <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Concomitantly with this condition he experienced complete remission of his inflammatory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunologic studies of B and T lymphocyte function showed that the number of circulating T and B lymphocytes were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, while T cell function was depressed, as evidenced by markedly reduced proliferative responses to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogens</z:chebi> and antigens, and ability to mediate B cell help </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, his circulating B cells were unable to secrete IgM or IgG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>He also exhibited anergy to intradermal challenge with a battery of common antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The literature dealing with this clinical association is reviewed, and possible immunologic mechanisms involved are discussed </plain></SENT>
