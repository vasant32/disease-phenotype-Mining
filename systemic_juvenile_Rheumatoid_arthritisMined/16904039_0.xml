<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Initially, he presented large-joint <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> of the right knee and heel, with clinical data of systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, increase in sedimentation rate and leucocytosis, during more than six weeks of evolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A wrong initial diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003095'>septic arthritis</z:hpo> was made, but the lack of response to antibiotics and surgical drainage of the knee led to a trial with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi>, which induced clinical remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient remained hospitalized for 24 days and underwent surgical drainage, knee arthroscopy, two bone gammagrams, nuclear magnetic resonance, and antibiotics, as well as considerable stress and uncertainty for him and his family </plain></SENT>
