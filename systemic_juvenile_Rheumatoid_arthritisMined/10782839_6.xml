<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The new International League of Associations for Rheumatology (ILAR) classification criteria were proposed to facilitate communication among pediatric rheumatologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Before they are applied in daily practice they should be clinically validated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively applied the proposed criteria on our pediatric rheumatology patient population seen between June 1 and August 31, 1998 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We saw 67 patients with oligoarticular (oJRA), 6 with polyarticular/RF negative (pJRA), and 8 with systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0005681'>juvenile rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> (sJRA), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> classified according to American College of Rheumatology criteria, 5 with juvenile psoriatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> (PsA) according to the Vancouver criteria, and 11 with juvenile <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0949690" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">spondyloarthritis</z:e> (SP) according to the European <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0949691" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SPDA1">Spondylarthropathy</z:e> Study Group preliminary criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the 97 patients, 85 could be clearly classified according to the ILAR criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients (12%) were classified as "other." Six patients could not be classified as "oligo" because of a family history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003765'>psoriasis</z:hpo>, and did not fulfill the criteria for PsA either </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 6 "other" patients fulfilled criteria for 2 different categories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: With this ILAR proposed classification criteria 88% of patients could be classified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In patients classified as "other," the psoriatic trait caused the most difficulty in classification </plain></SENT>
