 AIM: Cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are congenital lesions which     rarely recur after complete microsurgical excision. MATERIAL and METHODS: This     case report presents a 35-year-old woman who had been referred with a     hemorrhagic AVM five years ago. This patient has recently undergone     microsurgical excision for her left parieto-occipital Grade II AVM and surgical     clipping of the left posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) aneurysm which     was concomitantly detected. She is the oldest case reported whose AVM recurred     as Grade III, which is bigger than her first AVM associated with an aneurysm. CONCLUSION: Although some authors do not propose routine additional follow-up in     adults after the initial negative postoperative angiogram, we believe that such     patients should be followed clinically and radiologically.
