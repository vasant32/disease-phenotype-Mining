Trigeminal trophic ulceration is a rare clinical entity after an injury to the sensitive root of the trigeminal nerve, mostly due to therapy for trigeminal neuralgia. Other rare causes are Wallenberg's syndrome or a history of removal of acoustic neuroma. After weeks to years, a slowly progressive ulceration develops due to autonomic dysfunction and the patient manipulation because of serious chronic paresthesia. Finally, in many cases, a significant defect of the nasal arch develops. In spite of typical clinical signs and location, diagnosis is made late in most cases. Reviewing the literature, two cases are presented and diagnostic problems and difficulties of the most effective therapeutic approach are discussed.
