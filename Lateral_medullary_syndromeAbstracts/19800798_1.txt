We describe a patient presenting with the rapid onset of incomplete Wallenberg syndrome (WS) as the initial clinical manifestation of multiple sclerosis (MS). This patient was initially diagnosed with acute ischaemic lateral medullary syndrome, but further assessment led to the diagnosis of definite MS. Our report aims to highlight the importance of awareness of MS as a cause of WS, as well as the potential misdiagnosis of MS as stroke.
