Neurocysticercosis (NCC) frequently appears by seizures following parenchymatous location of encysted worms of Taenia solium. We report a case of NCC revealed by a Wallenberg's syndrome. A man of 44 years old, without any cardiovascular risk factor was admitted at the neurology department of Yalgado-Ou√©draogo hospital in Ouagadougou for an abrupt onset of vertigos, recurrent falls on the right side, hiccough, and deglutition weakness. The clinical examination found a blood pressure at 130 mmHg/80 mmHg, a CMI at 24, a Wallenberg's syndrome. The CT scan showed a laterobulbar lacunar infarct with punctiform calcifications of cerebellum, third ventricle, frontal, right temporal, occipital and left parietal lobes. The CSF showed a raise of cells number at 23 lymphocytic elements, proteins rose to 1.5 g/l, glucose and chloride were normal. Cysticercosis blood and CSF serologies were positive. The blood cells count showed only an eosinophilia and the blood sedimentation rate reached 119 mm in the first hour. The accepted diagnosis was: laterobulbar lacunar infarct following a NCC angiitis. The course of the disease under albendazole at 15 mg/kg during two weeks combined with a short steroid therapy by prednisolone at 1 mg/kg during 5 days was favourable. NCC should be more and more regarded as a cerebrovascular risk factor in endemic area, especially in young people.
