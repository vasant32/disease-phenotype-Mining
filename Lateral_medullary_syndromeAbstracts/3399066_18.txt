Over a 24-month period we evaluated 14 patients with neurologic disease associated with cocaine abuse. Five patients developed previously unreported complications: anterior spinal artery syndrome, lateral medullary syndrome, transient ischemic attacks in the middle cerebral artery and vertebrobasilar artery territories, and partial motor seizures. The recent availability of crack has led to a great increase in neurologic problems associated with the use of this drug.
