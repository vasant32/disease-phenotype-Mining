Saccadic eye movements and the adaptive control of their amplitudes were examined in patients with Wallenberg's lateral medullary syndrome. Half of the patients had permanent saccadic dysmetria. Their primary saccades had asymmetric amplitudes: those made in response to an ipsilateral target step (i.e. to the lesion side) tended to be hypermetric and saccades made in response to a contralateral target step were strongly hypometric. Multiple correction saccades were needed for target fixation. The adjustment of the amplitude of artificially induced hypermetric saccades, called gain adaptivity, was examined experimentally by using double target steps. The first target step elicited the primary saccade which triggered a further target displacement. This second, intra-saccadic target displacement was opposite to the first target step and caused the primary saccade to overshoot the final target position. In this way a post-saccadic target position error was generated which had to be corrected for foveal fixation. With repetition of this stimulus sequence the saccadic control system of normal subjects made an adjustment in amplitude of the main saccade such that the overshooting gradually diminished. After a few hundred trials primary saccades became orthometric with respect to the final target position; in respect to the first target step they were, however, strongly hypometric. The experimental data show that patients with Wallenberg's syndrome had a reduced capability to readjust saccadic amplitude. This observation together with the enduring saccadic dysmetria suggest that adaptive gain control of saccades is impaired in patients with lesions restricted to the dorsolateral medulla. It is speculated that these lesions most likely disrupt olivo-cerebellar pathways which are believed to be of paramount importance in visuo-motor adaptation of the cerebellum.
