A 55-years-old woman had left neck pain and headache, dizziness, left Horner's sign, left abducens palsy, diplopia, left peripheral facial palsy, left loss of hearing, left tinnitus, left paralysis of vocal cord and soft palate, dysphagia, left limb ataxia, truncal ataxia, disturbance of temperature and pain sensation over Th10 on the right involving the right face. Left vertebral angiography revealed tapering occlusion of the left vertebral artery. Right vertebral angiography showed normal angiogram of the basilar artery and bilateral anterior inferior cerebellar arteries. MRI disclosed infarcts in the left lateral inferior pons, left lateral medulla, and cerebellum of territories in the anterior inferior cerebellar artery and posterior inferior cerebellar artery. T2 weighted image showed septum (intimal flap) in the left vertebral artery. This is the very rare case of lateral inferior pontine syndrome and lateral medullary syndrome due to the vertebral artery dissection.
