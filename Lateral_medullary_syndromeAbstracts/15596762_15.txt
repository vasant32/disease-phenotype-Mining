The authors sought to clarify whether lesions in different parts of the cerebellum result in differential cognitive and affective impairment. Six subjects with cerebellar lesions due to posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) infarction, five subjects with lesions in the SCA vascular territory, and 11 matched controls were administered a battery of standard neuropsychological tests. PICA lesions but not SCA lesions resulted in cognitive and affective deficits pointing to a dominant role of posterior cerebellar regions in cognitive and affective processing.
