 BACKGROUND: The relationship between human immunodeficiency virus infection and stroke may be attributed in some cases to an underlying vasculopathy such as in spontaneous cervical arteries dissections. CASE REPORT: We report the case of an HIV-infected patient who developed a Wallemberg's syndrome due to a vertebral artery dissection. Screening laboratory exams showed hyperhomocysteinemia and also high C-reactive protein plasma levels. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first case describing the association between arterial dissection (AD) and HIV-infection. We suggest that AD should also be remembered as a possible mechanism of ischemic stroke in HIV-infected patients.
