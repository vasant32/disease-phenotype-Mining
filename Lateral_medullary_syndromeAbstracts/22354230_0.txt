CASE REPORT: A 45-year-old man came to our hospital with a chief complaint of occipital pain followed by gait disturbance and developing hypohidrosis on the right side 6 days after the onset. Brain MRI revealed an acute infarction in the dorsolateral part of right medulla. Bladder catheter was inserted because of dysuria. 8 days after the onset, the bladder contraction and desire to urinate were normal, by cystometry. However, micturition was still impossible without a catheter. His dysuria was considered to be due to Detrusor-Sphincter Dyssynergia (DSD). 19 days after the onset, he was able to urinate without a catheter. We found only 5 reported cases of lateral medullary infarction with dysuria, all of which had abnormal bladder contraction. This is the first case report of lateral medullary infarction with dysuria in spite of normal bladder contraction.
