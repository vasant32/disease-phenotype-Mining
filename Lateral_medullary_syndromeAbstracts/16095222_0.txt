A 68-year-old man presented with right eye pain and vertigo. Thereafter, he gradually leaned rightward, then laid down. He felt nausea and vomited. His right upper eyelid drooped and he felt dysethesia of the right hand. On neurological examination, ptosis of his right eye with slightly miotic right pupil, paresis of the right soft palate and hoarseness were noted. Arm deviation test demonstrated rightward deviation. He presented sensory ataxia of the right upper and lower extremities: finger nose test showed mild dysmetria of the right upper extremity, heel knee test demonstrated dysmetria of right lower extremity and these findings worsened when he closed his eyes. He showed mild bending of his bilateral ring and little fingers when he did rapid alternative movement. He leaned rightward when he sat and closed his eyes. Position sense of his right upper and lower extremities was decreased and sometimes he could not answer correctly when asked on which direction his finger pointed. Pinprick sensation was mildly decreased on the left side not including the face. Touch and vibration sense were normal. SEP findings on upper and lower extremity stimulation were normal. MRI of the brain showed T2 high intensity and partially T1 low intensity lesion at the right medulla (Figure). MR angiography showed no apparent lesion of major arteries such as dissection of the vertebral arteries. He complained and presented with hiccup initially. On MRI, the lesion was thought to involve the spinothalamic tract, medial lemniscus and inferior olivary nucleus. Ambiguus nucleus was in the lesion and solitary nucleus near the lesion. There is no report that seems to describe clinical features of a lesion like that in this case. Intermediate medullary infarction may present dissociated sensory disturbance like Brown-Sequard syndrome and position sensory disturbance without disturbance of vibration sense.
