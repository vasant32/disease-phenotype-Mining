A 75-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with dysesthesia of the right lip, dysphagia and gait disturbance. He presented with right Wallenberg syndrome and brain MR image showed a fresh infarction in the right lateral medulla. Therapy with heparin and ozagrel sodium was started. For a time his symptom improved a little, but after 8 days he developed re-infarction, thrombocytopenia and DIC, while being treated with heparin for cerebral infarction. Heparin was discontinued, and these symptoms improved quickly. The clinical course and the positive anti-platelet factor 4-heparin complex antibody suggested that these symptoms were caused by heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). HIT should be included as a differential diagnosis for progression of ischemic stroke under heparin therapy.
