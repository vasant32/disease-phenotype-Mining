A case of tonic deviation of gaze in a case of Wallenberg's syndrome is presented. Apart from oculostatic signs there were oculokinetic disorders presenting as a dysmetria of saccades with hypometria contralateral to the lesion. The physiopathology of this disorder is discussed. This syndrome of ocular lateropulsion probably results from a lesion of the restiform body interrupting cerebello-vestibular connections, associated with a lesion of the inferior part of the vestibular nuclei.
