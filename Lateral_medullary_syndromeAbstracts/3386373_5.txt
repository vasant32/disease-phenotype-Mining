The purpose of this paper is to illustrate the clinical usefulness of simultaneous fluoroscopy and manometry, as analyzed by the manofluorogram, in the evaluation of dysphagia. Four quantitative parameters calculated from the manofluorogram are analyzed and compared in six representative cases of dysphagia. The manofluorogram adds diagnostic information which cannot be obtained by barium swallow or standard manometry.
