A 25-year-old man developed Wallenberg syndrome (WS). At that time his carotid angiography was normal. When he was 28 years old, he suffered from retinal artery embolism in the left eye. At the age of 30 years, he had an acute onset of abducens nerve palsy in his right eye. The carotid angiography showed a giant aneurysm at the cavernous sinus portion in the right internal carotid artery. At his age of 38, the right oculomotor, trochlear and trigeminal nerves were involved. A vertebral angiography revealed a bead-like formation, and a diagnosis of fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) was made. An intensive angiographic examination revealed many stenotic or dilated lesions in the carotid, vertebral, coronary, renal, and hepatic arteries. A sural nerve biopsy specimen revealed that the sural vein was involved. In Japan only one case of FMD presenting with WS is known. FMD should be under consideration as an underlying disease, when WS occurred in younger patients with few risk factors. In this patient an angiography revealed no abnormality in the cavernous sinus portion of the internal carotid artery, when he suffered from WS. However, eight years later he was proved to have a giant aneurysm in the cavernous sinus portion. In conclusion, we support the hypothesis that aneurysm may originate from angiographically normal arterial wall in FMD.
