Hearing impairment is a rare but characteristic symptom of vertebrobasilar occlusive disease. Two patients with anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA) infarction and hearing loss as presenting complaint, are described. In patient 1 progressive bilateral AICA infarction was caused by occlusion of the basilar artery, verified by transcranial Doppler sonography. Initial dizziness and bilateral hearing loss were followed by ataxia, dysarthria, dysphagia and right facial sensory impairment. Hearing loss improved during the second week, parallel to a temporary partial recanalisation of the basilar artery, but the patient subsequently developed further progressive brain stem symptoms and died. A right-sided AICA-infarction was diagnosed in patient 2. Initial symptoms were right-sided deafness and dizziness. Neurological examination revealed nystagmus, ataxia and involvement of th 5th and 6th cranial nerve. A progressive improvement of hearing loss and total recovery of the other brain stem symptoms was evident. In conclusion every patient with sudden hearing loss should be examined for additional brain stem symptoms since this can be the presenting sign of a life-threatening basilar artery thrombosis.
