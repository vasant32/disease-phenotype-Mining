Shivering is mediated via the predominantly uncrossed reticulospinal tract. We report a case of a patient with left lateral medullary tract infarct involving the reticulospinal tract who displayed ipsilateral absence of shivering during a febrile episode. The physiology and anatomy of shivering and the reticulospinal tract is reviewed.
