 BACKGROUND: We present a 13-year followup of a case of Wallenberg's syndrome, including a first-person account and ocular motor abnormalities. METHODS: Objective infrared eye-tracking systems were used to record horizontal and vertical eye movements binocularly under a variety of conditions. RESULTS: Fixation in the dark along the midline remained as before, with vestibular jerk nystagmus continuously present. While saccades and pursuit to a visual target also remained the same as found earlier, fixation was somewhat worse, revealing not only saccadic intrusions but also a prominent right-jerk nystagmus. DISCUSSION: The results suggest lack of additional oculomotor neural plasticity after the end of the initial 10-year test period, and furthermore reveal apparent subtle age-related changes in oculomotor responsivity.
