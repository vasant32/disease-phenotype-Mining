A 63-year-old woman presented with an isolated axial lateropulsion as a sole manifestation of lateral medullary infarction. She had no vertigo, nystagmus, dysphagia, hiccup, facial/hemisensory loss, Horner syndrome, and limb ataxia. Brain MRI showed a small infarct selectively involving the most dorsolateral portion of the rostral medulla. This patient illustrates that lateral medullary infarction may present as an isolated lateropulsion. The possible mechanism of an isolated lateropulsion is described.
