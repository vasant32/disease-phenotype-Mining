A rare case of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) associated with lateral medullary syndrome and unilateral internuclear ophthalmoplegia was reported. A 15 year old girl was admitted to Kyushu University hospital on 2 September in 1987 because of vertigo, occular symptom, and sensory disturbance. She had noted vertigo since 28 August. On admission she had nystagmus, left Horner syndrome, sensory disturbance of left hemiface and right limbs and trunk and mild hemiparesis of right limbs. She also had a discoid erythema behind the left ear, butterfly rash on her cheek. She developed right internuclear ophthalmoplegia on 6 September. Investigations revealed biological false positive of serological test for syphilis, positive antinuclear antibodies, and prolonged APTT. Peripheral blood cell count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were normal. There was no proteinuria. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging failed to detect any lesions in the brain. Cerebrospinal fluid cell count was 20/3 and Ig-G index was 17.1%. Her neurological signs were thought to be related to SLE. Lupus anticoagulant might be responsible for the development of impairment of central nervous system (CNS). She was treated with prednisolone, initial dose of 40mg, and the symptoms and signs were improved quickly. Early diagnosis and treatment for SLE with CNS involvement is primarily important.
