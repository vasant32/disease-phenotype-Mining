We report an atypical Wallenberg syndrome presented with an acute vertigo, preceded by headache, simulating a peripheral vestibular pathology. The first Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) study done in urgencies is negative. Presence of headache, strong lateral ataxia and secondary focally neurological symptoms 48h after the beginning of the crises, lead to a repetition of the MRI which shows a right lateral bulbar infarct. We focus on the semiological elements that can guide us to a lateral bulbar pathology in patients with pseudoperypheric symptoms (axial latero-pulsion, ocular laterodeviation, posterior headache, oculographic test, etc.).
