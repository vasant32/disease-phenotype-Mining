Eight patients with a clinical diagnosis of lateral medullary (Wallenberg's) syndrome were studied with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 1.5 Tesla. On T1-weighted axial images, small hypointense lesion (infarct) was demonstrated in the region of lateral medulla in 6 patients. Ipsilateral hemiatrophy of the medulla was revealed in one patient. In the remaining one patient, a thrombosed vertebral artery was disclosed. It was therefore concluded that MRI is useful diagnostic modality for Wallenberg's syndrome.
