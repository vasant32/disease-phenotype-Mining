 OBJECT: The goal of this study was to implement an algorithm for and assess the multimodal (endovascular and microsurgical) treatment of patients with ruptured dissecting aneurysms of the vertebral artery (VA) during the acute stage. METHODS: During a 4-year period, the authors treated 19 ruptured dissecting aneurysms of the VA during the acute stage, within 3 days after the hemorrhage. Factors guiding management decisions were tolerance of the test occlusion and the site of the dissection. The algorithm takes into account these factors to select among treatment options, that is, trapping of the VA with Guglielmi Detachable Coils (GDCs); trapping of the VA and revascularization of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA); trapping of the VA and VA-posterior cerebral artery (PCA) anastomosis; and trapping of the VA, VA-PCA anastomosis, and revascularization of the PICA. Of the 15 aneurysms without PICA involvement, 14 were treated by trapping of the VA with GDCs and one by trapping of the VA and a VA-PCA bypass. The other four aneurysms with PICA involvement were treated by VA trapping and PICA revascularization. There was no episode of recurrent hemorrhage or ischemia during the posttreatment follow-up period. Although lateral medullary syndrome developed as a permanent complication in one patient, a good recovery was made by the other 18 patients by 6 months after the ictus. CONCLUSIONS: The factors that determine the appropriate treatment for ruptured dissecting aneurysms of the VA are tolerance of a test occlusion and the site of dissection. Favorable patient outcomes can be achieved when this algorithm is used.
