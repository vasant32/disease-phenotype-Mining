INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: The neurologic complications associated with herpes zoster are infrequent except for postherpetic neuralgia. The aim of this study was to review the clinical profile and the distribution of these complications in a retrospective series of patients. PATIENTS AND METHOD: A retrospective analysis of the last 100 patients admitted with the diagnosis of herpes zoster with neurologic complications to our center from 1992 to 1999 by the Departments of Internal Medicine and Neurology was performed. The characteristics of the complications other than postherpetic neuralgia are reported. RESULTS: Aside from the 88 patients with postherpetic neuralgia, the 12 remaining patients presented other complications: seven different peripheral neuropathies, including three with Ramsay-Hunt syndrome, two meningitis, one encephalitis and one myelitis. In addition, one patient had ophthalmic herpes zoster with cerebral vasculopathy as ipsilateral Wallenberg's syndrome. Nine patients (75%) were males, four (25%) were under the age of 20 years and seven older than 60 years and only three were immunodepressed. The CSF was abnormal in six out of the eight patients in whom it was studied with lymphocytic pleocytosis being shown on analysis without qualitative or quantitative alteration in intrathecal synthesis of IgG. In the immunosuppressed patients the serology in the CSF of the varicela zoster virus was negative. All patients demonstrated regressive evolution following treatment with acyclovir. CONCLUSIONS: Neurologic complications other than postherpetic neuralgia occurred in 12% of the patients of this series, there was male predominance and peripheral neuropathies were the most frequent complications. Serology of the varicela zoster virus in immunosuppressed patients may be negative. In this series the prognosis was mainly satisfactory.
