We report a case of rhombencephalitis with meningitis in a 36-years-old previously healthy man; neurological signs and symptoms were initially consistent with a diagnosis of Wallenberg syndrome. Analysis of cerebrospinal fluid showed predominantly lymphocytic pleocytosis and elevated protein levels. A CT brain scan was normal. MRI of the brain showed a hypertensive type lesion in T2, in the right pontomedullary region that suggested inflammation. A blood culture grew Listeria monocytogenes. The patient improved and fully recovered with appropriate antibiotic treatment. Listeria monocytogenes is a recognized cause of acute brainstem meningoencephalitis. Differential diagnoses that must be considered are other forms of purulent meningitis, viral meningoencephalitis, granulomatosis infections of the central nervous system and, occasionally, stroke.
