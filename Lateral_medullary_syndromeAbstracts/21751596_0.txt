Brainstem tuberculomas are quite unusual, accounting for less than 5 % of all intracranial tuberculoma. Intracranial tuberculoma is rare form of central nervous system tuberculosis. Lateral medullary syndrome is a combination of clinical features commonly attributed to infarction in territory of posterior inferior cerebellar artery or vertebral artery. We report a case suffering from lateral medullary syndrome resulting from brainstem tuberculoma which has not been reported so far in the literature. This patient was started on antituberculous chemotherapy and repeat magnetic resonance imaging of the cranium revealed regression of the lesion.
