The use of autogenous fat for augmentation of the paralyzed vocal fold is a promising substitute for alternate injectable material such as Teflon (polytef paste, polytetrafluoroethylene; Ethicon) and Gelfoam (absorbable gelatin sponge; Upjohn). Long-term histologic evaluation of fat grafts to the larynx has not previously been reported in the literature. We present a case report of autogenous fat augmentation of a paralyzed vocal fold with documentation of persistent fat graft present 5 months after transplant.
