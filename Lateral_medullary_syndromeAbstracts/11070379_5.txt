Isolated vertigo and ataxia have not been reported as manifestations of lateral medullary infarction. The author describes 3 patients with lateral medullary infarction who presented with almost isolated vertigo and gait ataxia without usual signs/symptoms of lateral medullary infarction such as facial/hemibody sensory changes, dysphagia, hoarseness, hiccup, limb ataxia, and Horner sign. Brain MRI showed small infarcts selectively involving the most dorsolateral portion of the rostral medulla that corresponds to the vestibulocerebellar pathway. These patients illustrate that lateral medullary infarction may present as an isolated vertigo and gait ataxia. Clinicians should be aware of this clinical variant, because these patients may be misdiagnosed as having labyrinthine disorders.
