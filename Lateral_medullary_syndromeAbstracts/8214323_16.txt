INTRODUCTION: A link between sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) and autoimmune disease is postulated. The association of SNHL in a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus is reported. METHODS: An adolescent female with left lateral medullary syndrome and right internuclear ophthalmoplegia was diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus. Treatment with prednisolone markedly improved her symptoms. Two years later, profound SNHL developed in the right ear. Extensive serologic testing was undertaken. RESULTS: Serologic tests for syphilis were false-positive. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to the immunoglobulin (Ig)G anticardiolipin antibody was positive. The anticardiolipin antibody is strongly correlated with episodes of recurrent venous or arterial thrombosis. CONCLUSIONS: It appears that the anticardiolipin antibody may be associated with sudden profound sensorineural hearing loss in patients with autoimmune disease.
