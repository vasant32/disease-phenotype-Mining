A 68-year-old man developed vertigo with a lateral medullary syndrome (figure). Right-beating nystagmus, seen under Frenzel lenses, reversed when a vibrator (60 Hz) was applied on either sternocleidomastoid muscle or either mastoid. When the vibrator was turned off, the nystagmus returned to right-beating (video on the NeurologyÂ® Web site at www.neurology.org).
