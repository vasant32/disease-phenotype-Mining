INTRODUCTION: Isolated bulbar infarcts are infrequent. Because of the vascular anatomy the lateral region is the most commonly affected, and in this clinical disorder the various signs and symptoms are grouped together as the so-called Wallenberg's syndrome. Since the introduction of magnetic resonance (MR) it has been possible to correlate the extent and site of the laterobulbar area involved with the most probable vascular topography and etiopathogenesis. CLINICAL CASE: We describe the case of a 69 year old female patient with all the symptoms of Wallenberg's syndrome and two potential causes of stroke (emboliogenic cardiopathy and atherothrombotic vascular occlusion), in whom MR showed the presence of an isolated bulbar lesion of unusual morphology which had previously been described as being of thrombotic origin. CONCLUSIONS: In spite of the small area of the brain involved, in laterobulbar infarcts MR permits definition of different topographic patterns of ischemic lesions. Some of these patterns have been correlated with the specific aetiology of an infarct. Therefore there is twice the importance of cerebral MR in cases of suspicion of lateral bulbar ischaemia, since it not only assists in diagnosis and its clinicopathological correlations, but also, as in our case, helps to have a clinical suspicion of the most likely etiopathogenesis of the stroke.
