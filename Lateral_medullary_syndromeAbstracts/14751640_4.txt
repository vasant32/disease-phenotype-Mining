 BACKGROUND: In patients with aneurysms that involve the origin of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) and require occlusion of the vertebral artery (VA), revascularization of the PICA is commonly performed. We present six patients with dissecting VA aneurysms who underwent PICA-PICA anastomosis combined with parent artery occlusion. METHODS: After a lower lateral suboccipital craniectomy and partial resection of the jugular tubercle, anastomoses were performed in a side-to-side fashion at the posterior medullary segment of the PICA. The VA was subsequently occluded by clipping proximal and distal to the aneurysm, and the PICA was occluded by clipping distal to the aneurysm. RESULTS: Postoperative cerebral angiography demonstrated patency of the anastomosis and regression of the aneurysm in five of six patients. The remaining patient experienced hemorrhage from contralateral VA dissection and subsequently died. One patient experienced myopathy of the lower extremities secondary to intraoperative fixed board compression and developed permanent lower extremity muscular weakness. The remaining four cases experienced no new neurologic deficits. CONCLUSION: PICA-PICA anastomosis is a useful procedure for reconstruction of the PICA when parent vessel occlusion or trapping is necessary to exclude a VA aneurysm involving the origin of the PICA.
