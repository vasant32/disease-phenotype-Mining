The present article describes a patient with ischemia in the vascular territory of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery, who developed, in addition to other typical signs of the dorsolateral medulla oblongata, myoclonic movements of the ipsilateral vocal cord. The essential neuropathological lesion is considered to be an impairment of the dentato-olivary system. In this respect there is a close relationship to other types of rhythmical myoclonus due to lesions of the brain-stem and cerebellum.
