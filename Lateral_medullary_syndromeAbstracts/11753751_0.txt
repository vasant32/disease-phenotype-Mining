Horner syndrome is defined as homolateral miosis, ptosis and enophthalmus, and occurs after a lesion of central or peripheral sympathetic pathways. The syndrome is mentioned as side effect for example with dysraphias, the Wallenberg syndrome, ischemic stroke of the middle cerebral artery, mediastinal tumors or iatrogen after pneumothorax interventions. We recently observed a patient with a transient significant miosis, without ptosis and enophthalmus, which we interpreted as an incomplete manifestation of a Horner syndrome occurring with spontaneous pneumothorax.
