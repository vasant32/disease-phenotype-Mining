A patient developed a trophic ulceration of the nose after an acute bulbar ischemia with infarction of the right trigeminal nuclei. Neurologic examination showed symptoms of a Wallenberg syndrome including ipsilateral hyp- and paresthesia of the second trigeminal branch and disturbed sensibility and temperature sense on the contralateral half of the body. The right ala nasi showed the characteristic sickle-shaped defect (ulc√©ration en arc). The differential diagnosis and therapeutic approaches are discussed.
