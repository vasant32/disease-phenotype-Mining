A 68-year-old man developed a sudden onset of the left Wallenberg's syndrome with additional left hypoglossal nerve palsy and contralateral hemiparesis sparing the face. The clinical constellation, known as Babinski-Nageotte syndrome, is regarded as a combination of the medial and lateral medullary syndrome. Magnetic resonance imaging showed potential of in vivo confirmation of the underlying vascular insult, which clearly demonstrated an infarct area in the left half of the medulla oblongata.
