This is the first report of a patient presenting with a combination of Wallenberg and posterior spinal artery syndromes. The patient developed right hemiplegia and sensory disturbances on the right side of the face and over the whole body. MRI showed infarcts of the cerebellum, medulla oblongata, and upper cervical cord. These lesions were in the territory of the right posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) and the right posterior spinal artery (PSA). The combination was due to severe stenosis of the right vertebral artery.
