A 65-year old man was admitted with severe dysphagia, ataxia and aspiration pneumonia. Dysphagia and ataxia were caused by lateral medullary infarction (Wallenberg's syndrome). The swallowing abnormality was assessed by videofluorography and we attempted the balloon dilatation method for cricopharyngeal dysphagia. Three months after initiation of swallowing training, videofluorography (VF) showed that the magnitude of aspiration to the trachea had decreased and the patient began taking food by mouth. The balloon dilatation method is successful for chronic stage cricopharyngeal dysphagia and the VF test is useful for quantitative assessment of dysphagia and for deciding when to start oral intake in elderly patients.
