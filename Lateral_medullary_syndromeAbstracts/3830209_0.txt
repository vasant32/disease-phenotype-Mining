A 63-year-old Caucasian man was admitted for Wallenberg's syndrome following a left vertebral artery thrombosis. In addition to the classical symptoms, an axial lateropulsion to the left and ocular motor disorders (vertical diplopia, tonic deviation of the gaze to the left, skew deviation and horizonto-rotatory nystagmus) were present. These clinical signs are unusual, but in common Wallenberg's syndrome, neurophysiological tests often reveal slight abnormalities of oculomotor function: impairment of jerks, skew deviation, lateral deviation of the gaze in darkness. Interruption of cerebellar pathways is thought to be the cause of these symptoms. Their existence does not seem to change the outcome of these cases.
