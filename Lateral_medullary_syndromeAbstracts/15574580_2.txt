Pure sensory stroke is a common manifestation of a thalamic stroke and may occur less frequently in the infarction of the brainstem, internal capsule, and parietal cortex. The authors report a 47-year-old man who presented with loss of pain and temperature sensation in the left face, arm, trunk, and leg and was found to have a right lateral medullary infarction on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first case describing pure sensory stroke as a single, isolated manifestation of the lateral medullary infarction that was detected by diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. This case suggests that with the availability of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, pure sensory stroke may carry a broader spectrum of the anatomical localizations than previously determined and can localize to the lateral medulla. Therefore, a possibility of medullary infarction should be considered when a patient presents with pure sensory stroke, especially when diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging is not immediately available to provide radiographic correlation.
