Body lateropulsion may occur without signs of vestibular dysfunction and vestibular nucleus involvement. The authors examined 10 such patients with three-dimensional brainstem mapping. Body lateropulsion without limb ataxia reflected an impairment of vestibulospinal postural control caused by a lesion of the descending lateral vestibulospinal tract, whereas body lateropulsion with limb ataxia was probably the consequence of impaired or absent proprioceptive information caused by a lesion of the ascending dorsal spino-cerebellar tract.
