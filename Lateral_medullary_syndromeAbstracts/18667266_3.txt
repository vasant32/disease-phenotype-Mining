 OBJECTIVES: Cheiro-oral syndrome is characterized by sensory impairment confined to perioral area and ipsilateral fingers/hand. It results from an involvement of the ascending sensory tracts above the pons. However, a crossed pattern of perioral and acral paresthesia was rarely reported before. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study reports the neuroanatomic relationship, course and clinical significance of perioral and contralateral acral paresthesia in four patients. We term it the crossed cheiro-oral syndrome. RESULTS: All patients had lateral or dorsolateral medullary infarctions that were ipsilateral to their perioral paresthesia. The contributory origin is considered a diagonal lesion involving the par oralis fibers within the descending trigeminal sensory tract and acral portion of the lateral spinothalamic tract at the lateral portion of medulla oblongata. Despite of a restricted sensory disturbance at initial, progressive neurological disability terminated to Wallenberg's syndrome ensued in three patients and disabling deficits persisted in two of them. CONCLUSION: The crossed cheiro-oral syndrome seems a mild form of Wallenberg's syndrome. Therefore, it predicts medullary involvement and is also a warning sign for progression.
