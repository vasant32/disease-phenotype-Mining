<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By mobilising the vessel, and securing it away from the nerve, symptoms were relieved in 16 of 17 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100661'>trigeminal neuralgia</z:hpo> and in seven of nine patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0010828'>hemifacial spasm</z:hpo> for a follow-up period of up to four years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Trigeminal microvascular decompression had few complications, but three patients treated for facial hemispasm had postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0000365'>deafness</z:hpo> and one had a probable small brainstem <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The major advantage of this surgical approach is that is possible to relieve the symptoms without facial anaesthesia or <z:hpo ids='HP_0003470'>paralysis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
