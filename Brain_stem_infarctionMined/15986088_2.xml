<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this report, we describe two KTWS patients treated with radiotherapy after long-term conservative treatment or multiple surgical interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The first patient, a 15-year-old female, presented with vascular masses located on the right upper extremity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>She was treated conservatively for 14 years, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_686'>amputation</z:mpath> was offered at the age of 14 due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>cardiac failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A course of radiotherapy to a total dose of 40 Gy with conventional daily fractionation was administered as an alternative to the mutilating surgery, and prominent improvement both subjectively and objectively was detected 1 year after radiotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The second patient, a 40-year-old male, suffered from huge vascular masses of both the trunk and lower extremities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Despite multiple surgical interventions and conservative treatment, disease progressed and neurological symptoms occurred due to compression of vertebral structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>He was administered a course of 30 Gy radiotherapy with 1.5 Gy daily fractions to the lower thoracic region and whole abdominal cavity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Six months after radiotherapy, subjective relief described by the patient but without any objective response was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Though considered as a benign disease, KTWS can cause life-threatening complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The response of one of our patients is a hopeful finding for considering radiotherapy as an alternative treatment modality for these patients </plain></SENT>
