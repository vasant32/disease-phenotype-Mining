<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present series cerebellar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> involved only the AICA territory in 13 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They were bilateral in 3 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In these pontocerebellar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> the middle cerebellar peduncle was the core of the affected territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It was seldom selectively affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a few cases, the infarction extended to the flocculus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Next most frequently involved was a thin band of tissue in the adjacent cerebellar white matter, comprising laterally the neighbouring cerebellar lobules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The largest <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> extended to the anterior and inferior aspects of the cerebellum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In these cases, the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) was hypoplastic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In most <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, the inferolateral pontine territory was involved, the infarction sometimes extending up to the middle third of the lateral pons and down to the superior part of the lateral medulla </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No <z:hpo ids='HP_0002512'>brainstem compression</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0393983" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tonsillar herniation</z:e> were observed with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> affecting the AICA territory alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Clinically, involvement of several cranial nerves (<z:hpo ids='HP_0010628'>facial palsy</z:hpo>, multimodal trigeminal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003474'>sensory impairment</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000365'>deafness</z:hpo>, sometimes with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000360'>tinnitus</z:hpo>, a vestibular syndrome, or lateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112261" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gaze palsy</z:e>) was constant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001317'>Cerebellar signs</z:hpo> and motor <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> occurred frequently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Contralateral pain and temperature sensory loss was present at times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002277'>Horner's syndrome</z:hpo> or skew deviation was rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Study of the arteries showed that <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> was mainly due to <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> superimposed on atheromatous stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In 7 cases, the infarction also involved the PICA territory or the PICA and the superior cerebellar artery territories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>These extensive <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were often associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0393983" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tonsillar herniation</z:e> and massive paramedian <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brainstem infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The cases in which the territories of the three cerebellar arteries were affected presented in deep <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo>, together with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002445'>tetraplegia</z:hpo> in some patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Those in which PICA and AICA territories were involved together presented with similar clinical features as in the cases in which only the AICA territory was involved </plain></SENT>
