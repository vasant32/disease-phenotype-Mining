<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Persistent sciatic vein (PSV) is a rare anomaly most often associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022739" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="KTS">Klippel-Trenaunay Syndrome (KTS)</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and extended use of phlebography have increased the frequency of diagnoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To evaluate our experience, we reviewed patients in whom PSV was diagnosed at our institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: MRIs and phlebograms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">KTS</z:e> seen since 1985 were reviewed, and patients with PSV were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-one of 186 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">KTS</z:e> underwent MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PSV was diagnosed in 20 of the 41 (48.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, one other patient without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">KTS</z:e> had PSV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients (61.9%) were female </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patient age ranged from 5 to 71 years, with a median age of 22 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>PSVs were present in the entire thigh and buttock of eight patients (38.1%), the upper thigh and buttock of six patients (28.6%), and the lower thigh of seven patients (33.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Six patients (28.6%) had anorectal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformations</z:hpo> with heavy <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Five patients (23.8%) had pulmonary embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Two patients (9.5%) died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_686'>Amputation</z:mpath> was required in one (4.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Nineteen patients (90.5%) underwent no specific surgery for PSV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Two patients (9.5%) underwent successful excision of PSVs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Excision of PSV appears to be rarely indicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>It may be indicated for localized symptoms in patients whose condition and <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> permit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>PSV may be a marker for patients with more extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformations</z:hpo> and for those at high risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002573'>rectal bleeding</z:hpo> and pulmonary embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Prognosis is related to the associated vascular malformations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>MRI and extended use of phlebography should increase the frequency of diagnoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Treatment rationales should evolve </plain></SENT>
