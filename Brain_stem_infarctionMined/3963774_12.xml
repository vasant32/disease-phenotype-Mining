<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We correlated clinical, computed tomographic (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings in 14 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0236073" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebellar infarctions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Before MRI, the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0236073" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebellar infarction</z:e> was made in only 7 patients on the basis of clinical and CT evidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0236073" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebellar infarction</z:e> was bilateral in 3 patients and was associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brainstem infarction</z:e> in 6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Infarction occurred in the territory of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) in 12 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The territory of the superior cerebellar artery (SCA) was involved in 1 patient, and 1 infarction encompassed the watershed between the PICA and the SCA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In patients with infarction of the PICA territory, the medial and intermediate hemispheric segments were most frequently involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Involvement of the lateral hemispheric segment was infrequent and was independent of brainstem involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Because of its fine demonstration of anatomical detail, its lack of bony artifact, and its ability to visualize infarctions readily within the first 24 hours, MRI is an excellent method for demonstrating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0236073" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebellar infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
