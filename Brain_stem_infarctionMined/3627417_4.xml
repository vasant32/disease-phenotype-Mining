<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarcts</z:mpath> were widely distributed in each patient between the thalamus, midbrain, pons, cerebellum, and occipital lobe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both thalami were involved in 7 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When the thalamus was involved bilaterally, the low density areas were symmetrical in size and localization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Angiography revealed that stenosis or occlusion lay within a circle 2 cm in diameter surrounding the five-forked junction at the top of the basilar artery in 84.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Recanalization of the occluded artery occurred in 61.5%, suggesting that embolism played an important role in appearance of this syndrome </plain></SENT>
