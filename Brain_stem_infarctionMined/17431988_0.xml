<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To compare neuro-otological test results in aged patients complaining of dizziness with their magnetic resonance imaging findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: The presence of lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> of the hind-brain was used as a gold standard </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: A department of otolaryngology in a regional general hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients over 60 years old with dizziness during a period of 1 year 2 months, excluding those with central lesions of other than vascular origin (n=48) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULT: Lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were found in 22 patients: the cerebellum for two patients, the brain stem for 17, and both regions for three </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with lesions of the cerebellum or the lower brain stem showed central vestibular abnormalities, whereas eight patients with only the upper brain-stem lacunae did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A canal <z:mp ids='MP_0000754'>paresis</z:mp> was found in 12 of 20 patients with the brain-stem lacunae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients without lesions in the posterior fossa did not show significant abnormalities, indicating central disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study documents a high prevalence of lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> of the hindbrain in patients over 60 years old with dizziness, and it also demonstrates the difficulty in detecting small lesions of only the upper brain stem by neuro-otological tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This calls attention to a differential diagnosis in aged patients with dizziness </plain></SENT>
