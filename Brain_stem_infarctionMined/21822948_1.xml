<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of gelified <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi>, a newly developed sclerosing agent for slow-flow vascular malformations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventy-nine sclerotherapy procedures were performed on 44 patients with 37 venous malformations, 2 glomuvenous malformations, 2 lymphatic malformations, 2 lymphatico-venous malformations, and 1 Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The median injected volume was 1.00 mL/site of injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Effects of sclerotherapy on pain, functional and cosmetic disturbance were statistically evaluated with a final result score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Local and systemic complications were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean Visual Analogue Scores were 5.20  ±  2.81 before and 1.52  ±  1.25 after treatment (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Functional and aesthetic improvement was achieved in 31/35 patients (89%) and in 33/41 (80%), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Minor local side effects included <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> with or without issue of ethylcellulose, palpable residue, and <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No systemic side-effects occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Per mL used, radio-opaque gelified <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> is at least as effective as absolute <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No systemic complication was observed, as only a low dose of <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> was injected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Indications for sclerotherapy can be widened to areas with higher risk for local side effects (hands and periocular region), as <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> is trapped in the lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Careful injection procedure is though necessary, because only a limited amount of ethylcellulose can be used per puncture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Key Points • Development of a new sclerosing agent for venous malformations. • Interesting novel way to deliver alcohol to slow-flow vascular malformations. • Alcohol-based with less local and systemic side-effects </plain></SENT>
