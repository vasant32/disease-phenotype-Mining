<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A series of cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> with associated bilateral occipital calcifications (EBOC) without signs of phakomatosis and without any disorders known to produce <z:hpo ids='HP_0002514'>cerebral calcifications</z:hpo> have been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is unclear whether EBOC is an incomplete variant of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber disease</z:e> (SWD) or if it is a different, as yet undefined <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We describe four new cases of EBOC that are different clinically by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo>, type, course, severity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e>, and associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive deficits</z:hpo> but that are linked by similar neuroradiologic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Similar to cases described in the literature, there is convincing evidence in favor of the hypothesis that these cases belong to an <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> different from SWD and frequently associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002608'>celiac disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
