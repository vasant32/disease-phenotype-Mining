<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 49-year-old woman with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022739" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="KTS">Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome</z:e> (KTW) is reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>She had characteristic features of KTW; cutaneous <z:mp ids='MP_0002947'>angiomas</z:mp> on her back, left knee and both plantae, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">varicosities</z:e> on both legs, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> of the left leg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition she had rare complications of KTW; asymmetric skull bone, hemicranial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath>, kyphosoliosis, idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000829'>hypoparathyroidism</z:hpo>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0001256'>abnormal length</z:mp> of the dactyl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Her hemicranial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> was examined by CT scan, MRI and angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Her right hemicranial volume was enlarged and her left lateral ventricle was enlarged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The T2-weighted MRI imaging demonstrated high signal intensity beside the right lateral ventricle and in the right basal ganglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cerebrovascular anomalies were not revealed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>She also had neurological manifestations of KTW that are rarely seen in adult cases; <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002196'>myelopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The anti-HTLV-I antibodies in serum and cerebrospinal fluid were positive, so it was thought for her to have HTLV-I associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002196'>myelopathy</z:hpo> (HAM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>She was treated with peroral <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> and alpha-interferon (intramuscular), which improved her ability to walk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It is known that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002808'>kyphosis</z:hpo> sometimes makes the disorder of spinal cord </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although KTW is known to be associated with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002390'>spinal arteriovenous malformation</z:hpo>, several examinations did not reveal the spinal vascular anomalies in this case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>So we think the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002196'>myelopathy</z:hpo> of this case was caused mainly by the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002751'>kyphoscoliosis</z:hpo> and HAM </plain></SENT>
