<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Dissecting vertebrobasilar <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> are challenging to treat, and standard treatment modalities remain controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively evaluated our experience using endovascular techniques to treat these <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: From February 1997 to December 2007, 42 patients with intradural vertebrobasilar dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> underwent endovascular treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-nine patients had ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, and 13 patients had unruptured dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The endovascular modalities for vertebrobasilar dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were the following: 1) trapping (n = 30), 2) proximal occlusion (n = 3), 3) stent with coil (n = 6), and 4) stent alone (n = 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventeen of the 29 patients with ruptured vertebrobasilar dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> had successful outcomes without procedural complications following endovascular treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Procedure-related complications were the following: 1) rebleeding (n = 3), 2) posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) territory infarction (n = 6), 3) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain stem infarction</z:e> (n = 2), and 4) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo>-related multiple infarctions (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Clinical outcomes were favorable in 32 patients (76.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were 3 (7.1%) procedure-related mortalities due to rebleeding, and 1 (2.4%) non-procedure-related mortality due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 13 patients with unruptured vertebrobasilar dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> had favorable clinical and radiologic outcomes without procedure-related complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Endovascular procedures for treatment of unruptured symptomatic dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> resulted in favorable outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Ruptured vertebrobasilar dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> are associated with a high risk of periprocedural complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Risks can be managed by using appropriate endovascular techniques according to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> location, configuration, and relationship with the PICA </plain></SENT>
