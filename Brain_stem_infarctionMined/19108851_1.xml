<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Hemimedullary syndrome is very rare and combines the clinical features of lateral and medial medullary infarctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In patients with hemimedullary syndrome, the presence of ipsilateral, rather than contralateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo>, is rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To describe a patient with an infarction in the right hemimedulla with an ipsilateral motor deficit due to dissection of the right vertebral artery (VA) and to assess whether the ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> may be the result of a specific <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed the reports of hemimedullary syndrome in the literature and compared the characteristics of patients with dissection of the VA with those with VA atherosclerotic disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In our patient, magnetic resonance angiography showed dissection of the right VA to be the cause of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a review of the literature (including our case), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> was ipsilateral to the infarction in four of the five patients with VA dissection, but contralateral in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> six patients with atherosclerotic disease of the VA (p=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> five cases of VA dissection, the right hemimedulla was involved, while, in the six cases of atherosclerotic disease, the left side of the medulla oblongata was affected in five instances and the right side in one (p=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Dissection of the VA may provoke a hemimedullary lesion at a lower level than <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, thus affecting medullary-penetrating branches that irrigate the medulla immediately below the pyramidal decussation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Hemimedullary syndrome accompanied by ipsilateral motor deficit should raise suspicion of dissection of the VA </plain></SENT>
