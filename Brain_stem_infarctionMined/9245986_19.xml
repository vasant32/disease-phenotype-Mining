<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To identify mutations that cause hereditary hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001009'>telangiectasia</z:hpo> (HHT, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039445" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Rendu-Osler-Weber syndrome</z:e>), clinical evaluations and genetic studies were performed on 32 families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Linkage studies in four of eight families indicated an endoglin (ENG) gene mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>ENG sequences of affected members of the four linked families and probands from the 24 small families were screened for mutations, by Southern blot analyses and by cycle sequencing of PCR-amplified DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seven novel mutations were identified in eight families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two mutations (a termination codon in exon 4 and a large genomic deletion extending 3' of intron 8) did not produce a stable ENG transcript in lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five other mutations (two donor splice-site mutations and three deletions) produce altered <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> that are predicted to encode markedly truncated ENG proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mutations in other families are predicted to lie in ENG-regulatory regions or in one of the additional genes that may cause HHT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that the molecular mechanism by which ENG mutations cause HHT is haploinsufficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, because the clinical manifestation of disease in these eight families was similar, we hypothesize that phenotypic variation of HHT is not related to a particular ENG mutation </plain></SENT>
