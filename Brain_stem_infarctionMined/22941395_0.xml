<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The revival of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> surgery after the introduction of modern presurgical evaluation procedures has led to an increase in hemispherectomy or hemispherotomy procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since a large part of our pediatric series was done using a newer hemispherotomy technique, we focus mainly on the outcomes after a recently developed hemispherotomy technique (transsylvian keyhole) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ninety-six pediatric patients (aged 4 months to 18 years, mean 7.3) were operated on between 1990 and 2009; 92 were available with follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The most frequent diagnosis was <z:hpo ids='HP_0002132'>porencephaly</z:hpo> in 46 % of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Progressive etiologies were present in 20 % and developmental etiologies in 22 % </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At last available outcome (LAO), 85 % of the patients were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> free (ILAE class 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Year-to-year outcome was rather stable; usually over 80 % were class 1 for up to 13 years (n = 24) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of 92 assessable patients, 71 were treated with the transsylvian keyhole technique, with 89 % being <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> free </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The overall shunt rate was 5.3 % for the whole series and 3 % for the keyhole technique subgroup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mortality was 1 of 96 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Excluding patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0007206'>hemimegalencephaly</z:hpo> (HME), patients with the shortest duration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> and the lowest age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> had the highest rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> freedom </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The etiology does influence outcome, with HME patients having the poorest <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> outcome and patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002132'>porencephaly</z:hpo> having excellent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Hemispherotomies/functional hemispherectomies are very effective and safe procedures for treating drug-resistant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> with extensive unihemispheric pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Etiology and surgery type clearly influence <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> outcome </plain></SENT>
