<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The purpose is to show and discuss the findings in three cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One adult and two children were examined in the last three years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The girl was scanned after diode laser treatment for her right eye <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ultrasonographic examinations were performed with 20- and 25-MHz probes (nominal frequencies) for posterior pole and 35-MHz probe (closed system, HiScan Optikon 2000, Rome, Italy) for anterior segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases were characterized by choroid thickening due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0005306'>capillary hemangioma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The thickening was not regular and the use of 25-MHz probe proved superior in visualizing the two layers (choroid vs. sclera), showing a striking reflectivity difference between them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases also showed enlarged vortex veins and some anomalous vessels adjacent to the external surface of the sclera, i.e. posterior episcleral dilated vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In one case only, very anomalous tortuous vessels were found in the orbit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Disk cupping and/ or pseudo cupping was always present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases; in the oldest patient only, who had a thinner choroid, it was possible to display a concave bottom of the cup instead of the straight, small, highly reflective segment representing the cribrosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Serous <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> and choroid detachments were present as temporary complications after <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, choroid, facial and encephalon involvement in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome</z:e> is widely described in ocular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>oncology</z:hpo> books, whereas by far less attention is paid to orbital involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Anterior dilated episcleral vessels are visible and till now the posterior vessel involvement has only been demonstrated in some pathology specimens </plain></SENT>
