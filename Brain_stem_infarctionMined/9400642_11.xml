<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: For many years, dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of the intracranial vertebral artery were believed to be quite rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In recent years, because <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disorders</z:e> have been studied more thoroughly by three dimensional-computed tomography (3D-CT), angiographically and pathologically, these <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> are being reported with more frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Among the 45 patients diagnosed to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> arising from the vertebral artery or its branches over a 20-year period, 16 had dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The authors present their therapeutic strategy for these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Surgery was performed in the 16 patients, the most common technique being clip-occlusion or trapping of the parent artery wherever feasible, in an attempt to optimize cerebral blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of the vertebral artery were classified into two groups for the purpose of determining a therapeutic approach, namely unilateral and circumferential groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the unilateral group, the dissection seemed to involve only on one side of the vessel according to the conventional cerebral angiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These patients underwent surgical reconstruction of the vertebral artery by direct clipping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the circumferential group, the dissection was <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> around the artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Proximal clipping or trapping was performed in this group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In six out of eight patients with unilateral dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, vascular reconstruction was possible by direct clipping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Of these six patients, the surgical outcome was considered excellent in four, fair in one, and one patient died of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>cardiac failure</z:hpo> after 12 days as his preoperative morbid condition remained the same after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Two other patients with unilateral dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were treated with trapping technique and the surgical outcome was excellent in one patient and good in the other patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Both patients resumed a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> social life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In five out of eight patients with circumferential dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, trapping or proximal clipping was performed and the surgical outcome was excellent in two patients, good in one and fair in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>One patient with preoperative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain stem infarction</z:e> died of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032285" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PNEUM">pneumonitis</z:e> after 8 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Two patients who were noted to have an increase in the size of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> during follow-up angiography underwent a craniotomy with clipping and wrapping of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>There was a favorable surgical outcome in both patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The remaining three patients had Grade IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) prior to surgery and at autopsy a disturbed vascular wall was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The authors' experience suggests that when surgically feasible, direct clipping is an effective alternative approach in the treatment of dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of the vertebral artery in which blood flow in the parent artery is to be preserved </plain></SENT>
