<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty three subjects were examined, with mean age 73 (range 62 to 86 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subjects with brainstem <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or with large hemispheric lesions were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Spin echo 1.5 T MRI images were graded from 0 to 4 for severity of white matter lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Urinary function was assessed by detailed questionnaire and urodynamic studies were performed in 33 of the subjects, including measurement of postmicturition residuals, water cystometry, and sphincter EMG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A mini mental state examination (MMSE) and examination of gait was also performed and compared with urinary function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Urodynamic studies showed subjects with grade 1-4 white matter lesions to have detrusor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001347'>hyperreflexia</z:hpo> more commonly (82%) than those with grade 0 white matter lesions (9%) (p&lt;0.05), indicating that leukoaraiosis was a factor associated with geriatric urinary dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Postmicturition residuals, low compliance, detrusor-sphincter <z:hpo ids='HP_0010867'>dyssynergia</z:hpo>, and uninhibited sphincter relaxation were also more common in grade 1-4 than in grade 0 white matter lesions, though the difference was not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In grade 1 white matter lesions urinary dysfunction (urge <z:hpo ids='HP_0000020'>urinary incontinence</z:hpo>) was more common than cognitive (MMSE&lt;19) (p&lt;0.05) and gait disorders (slowness, short step/festination, and loss of postural reflex) (p&lt;0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>05), which increased together with the grade of white matter lesions (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Urinary dysfunction is common and probably the early sign in elderly people with leukoaraiosis on MRI </plain></SENT>
