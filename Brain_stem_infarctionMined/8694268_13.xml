<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In the midline of the embryo an invisible barrier exists that keeps endothelial cells from migrating to the contralateral side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Interspecific grafting experiments between chick and quail were carried out in order to investigate the role of the axial structures in maintaining this barrier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The quail endothelial cells of the graft were therefore stained with QH1 antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> experimental series quail paraxial mesoderm was used as a source of endothelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>First, a quail somite was transplanted either ipsilaterally or contralaterally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results not only show the existence of laterality in the distribution pattern, but also demonstrate that the laterality does not depend on the origin of the graft but on the environment of the host embryo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Laterality in the distribution pattern of endothelial cells means that the endothelial cells of the two body halves migrate independently and do not change from one side to the other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Single cells do not know whether they are cells from the right or from the left half of the body </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the next series of experiments axial structures were removed in order to modify the barrier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, paraxial mesoderm was exchanged with the corresponding quail tissue in order to determine the migration behaviour of the grafted endothelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The removal of the neural tube does not influence the barrier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>After notochordectomy, however, the endothelial cells exhibited a balanced distribution pattern over both halves of the embryo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We concluded that the notochord forms a barrier for endothelial cells that presumably operates on the basis of chemical substances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It is conceivable that our results can explain the lateralization of illnesses of the vascular system, as the Klippel-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Tr</z:e>Ã©naunay syndrome or the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
