<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report 13 patients presenting with predominantly sensory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brainstem infarction</z:e>, without any other brainstem symptoms such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001260'>dysarthria</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002321'>vertigo</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of them had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarctions</z:e> localized at the medial lemniscus and/or spinothalamic tract, at the pontine (12 patients) or midbrain (1 patient) tegmentum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The presenting symptom was dysesthesia with a variety of distributions for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, and a thalamic-pain-like unpleasant dysesthesia persisted in 4 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The lesion on brain MRI was usually very small, and was sometimes overlooked by radiological evaluation, which led to a long delay in the correct diagnosis of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in two cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median nerve somatosensory evoked potentials showed a depressed N20 amplitude or a loss of the P15 potential unilaterally with preserved P13/14 potential in 7 out of 10 cases examined, and was useful in localizing the lesion intracranially </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During the 4-year study period, 10 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brainstem infarctions</z:e> were admitted to our department as <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> sensory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> cases (2.1% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>), whereas 11 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1611171" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thalamic infarctions</z:e> (2.3%) were admitted due to similar symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cases with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brainstem infarctions</z:e> had sensory symptoms localized below the neck more frequently (5/10) than cases with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1611171" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thalamic infarctions</z:e> (1/11), thus would be more likely to be confused with cervical or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0031117" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">peripheral nerve disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The relative frequency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brainstem infarction</z:e> as compared to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1611171" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thalamic infarction</z:e> was higher than that in previous reports, implying that some cases with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brainstem infarction</z:e> might have been overlooked due to difficulty in obtaining the correct diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One should always keep this syndrome in mind when assessing patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute-onset</z:hpo> sensory symptoms </plain></SENT>
