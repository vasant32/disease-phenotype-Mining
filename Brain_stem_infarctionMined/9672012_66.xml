<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Our purpose was to evaluate the clinical efficacy, sensitivity, and specificity of echo-planar diffusion-weighted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 194 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> diagnosed clinically within 24 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and studied with echo-planar diffusion-weighted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Examinations were considered to be positive for infarction when an increase in signal was noted on images acquired at a high b value but absent on images with a low b value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A final clinical diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was used as the standard of reference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A subset of 48 patients scanned within 6 hours was also analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Diffusion-weighted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging studies were positive in 133 of 151 cases of infarction (88% sensitivity) and negative in 41 of 43 cases with no infarction (95% specificity) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two cases identified as positive on diffusion-weighted images had nonischemic diagnoses (1.5% false-positive rate) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Diffusion-weighted imaging had a positive predictive value of 98.5% and a negative predictive value of 69.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Use of T2-weighted sequences as well as diffusion-weighted imaging produced no false-positive findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of the negative scans, 69.5% corresponded to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (mostly <z:mp ids='MP_0000774'>small brain</z:mp> stem <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>When only cases scanned within 6 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> were considered, the sensitivity rose to 94% and the specificity to 100% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Despite bias due to dependence between diffusion-weighted imaging and the final diagnosis, this analysis suggests high sensitivity and specificity for echo-planar diffusion-weighted imaging in the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, although negative scans did not rule out an ischemic pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
