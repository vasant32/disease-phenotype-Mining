<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: It has been reported that the activating mutation, E133K, in the angiogenic factor VG5Q (formally named AGGF1) causes <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022739" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="KTS">Klippel-Trenaunay Syndrome (KTS)</z:e>, a rare <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> associated with asymmetric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This proposal followed from the observation that five out of 130 KTS patients were constitutionally heterozygous for VG5Q, E133K </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To explore the possibility that VG5Q, and specifically E133K, is implicated in other mosaic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 24 patients were analysed for this sequence change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One patient was constitutionally heterozygous for E133K </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analysis of both parents revealed that the patient's mother, who was healthy, also carried E133K </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An analysis of 275 healthy controls showed that 3.3% (9/275) of the population were carriers of E133K </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The findings bring into question the assertion that VG5Q, E133K is a mutation and that it causes <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">KTS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
