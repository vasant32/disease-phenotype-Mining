<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One patient probably suffered a brainstem <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> at the time that the unilateral flush was first noticed, and was left with a subtle <z:hpo ids='HP_0002277'>Horner's syndrome</z:hpo> on the side opposite to the flush </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The other four had no other neurological symptoms and no ocular signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002277'>Horner's syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thermal and emotional flushing and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000975'>sweating</z:hpo> were found to be impaired on the non-flushing side of the forehead in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> five patients whereas gustatory <z:hpo ids='HP_0000975'>sweating</z:hpo> and flushing were increased on that side in four of the five patients, a combination of signs indicating a deficit of the second sympathetic neuron at the level of the third thoracic segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CT and MRI of this area failed to disclose a structural lesion but latency from stimulation of the motor cortex and thoracic spinal cord to the third intercostal muscle was delayed on the non-flushing side in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The complaint of unilateral flushing and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000975'>sweating</z:hpo> was abolished in one patient by ipsilateral stellate ganglionectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The unilateral facial flushing and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000975'>sweating</z:hpo> induced by heat in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> five patients was thus a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or excessive response by an intact sympathetic pathway, the other side failing to respond because of a sympathetic deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> in the four cases of peripheral origin followed strenuous exertion, which suggested that an anterior radicular artery may have become occluded at the third thoracic segment during <z:mpath ids='MPATH_562'>torsion</z:mpath> of the thoracic spine </plain></SENT>
