<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An additional increase of sensitivity for detection of lesions may be achieved by contrast-enhanced flair imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Based on flair imaging a dual-echo inversion recovery imaging sequence (=proton echo usage [=protoneus] - sequence) was developed, which could significantly extend the possibilities of conventional flair imaging </plain></SENT>
