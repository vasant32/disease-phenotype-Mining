<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Neck manipulation, unlike gentler forms of manual therapy such as mobilisation, is associated with a small risk of serious neurovascular injury and can result in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is thought however, that neck manipulation provides better results than mobilisation where clinically indicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There is long standing and vigorous debate both within and between the professions that use neck manipulation as well as the wider scientific community as to whether neck manipulation potentially does more harm than good </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary aim of this study is to determine whether neck manipulation provides more rapid resolution of an episode of neck pain than mobilisation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS/DESIGN: 182 participants with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and sub-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> neck pain will be recruited from physiotherapy, chiropractic and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0419203,C0005940" disease_type="Health Care Activity;Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">osteopathy</z:e> practices in Sydney, Australia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Participants will be randomly allocated to treatment with either manipulation or mobilisation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Randomisation will occur after the treating practitioner decides that manipulation is an appropriate treatment for the individual participant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both groups will receive at least 4 treatments over 2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome is number of days taken to recover from the episode of neck pain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Cox regression will be used to compare survival curves for time to recovery for the manipulation and mobilisation treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: This paper presents the rationale and design of a randomised controlled trial to compare the effectiveness of neck manipulation and neck mobilisation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> neck pain </plain></SENT>
