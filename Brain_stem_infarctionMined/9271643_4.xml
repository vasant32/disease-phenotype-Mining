<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on 38 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> of the cervical spine; 69 vertebrae were affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Polyvinyl alcohol particles, coils, gelfoam particles, either alone or in combination, were used for preoperative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After embolization a total of 57 corporectomies with <z:chebi fb="55" ids="33341">titanium</z:chebi> basket implantation were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 36 of 38 patients, complete (n = 27) or partial (n = 9) embolization was achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 23 patients one vertebral artery was completely occluded by coil placement, and in one patient the ipsilateral internal and external carotid arteries were occluded in addition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No neurological complications could be directly related to the embolization, but two postoperative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain stem infarctions</z:e> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean intraoperative blood loss was 2.4 L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Transarterial embolization of cervical spine <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> is a safe and effective procedure to facilitate extensive surgery </plain></SENT>
