<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although a poor prognosis has been mentioned in previously reported patients, the precise pathomechanism and clinical significance are still unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We report four patients with ocular salt-and-pepper pain, and review the clinical course, neuroimaging and prognosis in another eight patients reported in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In our series, they were three men and one woman, and their underlying cause was pontine <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>; hypertensive <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> in three and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001048'>cavernous hemangioma</z:hpo> in one patient, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In these 12 salt-and-pepper patients, the identifiable etiology was exclusively brainstem <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Life-threatening or disable neurological deterioration ensued within 24 h after pain <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Their <z:hpo ids='HP_0200026'>ocular pain</z:hpo> subsided rapidly after neurological deterioration occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A dual excitation of nociceptive quinothalamic pain fiber and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000734'>disinhibition</z:hpo> of trigeminosensory system from pontine reticular formation and cerulotrigeminospinal circuit may be responsible for this pain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In clinical practice, ocular salt-and-pepper pain in quiet eyes should be alerted for intracranial pathology and neurological deterioration until underlying cause is identified </plain></SENT>
