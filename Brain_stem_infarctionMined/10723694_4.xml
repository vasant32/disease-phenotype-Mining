<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine whether there are specific situations which may increase the risk of accidental asphyxia during sleep in children with physical and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306341" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">mental disabilities</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY: Review of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases where <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was attributed to accidental asphyxia caused by unsafe sleeping situations in children listed in the Department of Histopathology database over a 10-year period from March 1989 to February 1999 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 26 cases were found (M:F, 19:7; age range, 1-48 months; average age, 7.4 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of those cases, two involved children with significant mental and physical impairment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Case 1: A 4-year-old boy with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022739" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="KTS">Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000256'>macrocephaly</z:hpo> and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>developmental delay</z:hpo>, was found dead with his head hanging over a wooden board attached to the side of his bed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Case 2: A 4-year-old boy with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001339'>lissencephaly</z:hpo> and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>developmental delay</z:hpo> was found dead wedged between a retractable mesh cot side and the side of his bed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In both cases the devices resulting in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> had been put in place to prevent the boys from falling out of bed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Accidental asphyxia in physically and mentally impaired children may be caused by devices that have been used to prevent injury from falling out of bed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Careful assessment of the specific developmental problems that children suffer should be undertaken before their beds are modified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It may be safer for these children either to have no barrier, or to have drop-sided cots/beds that meet recognized safety standards </plain></SENT>
