<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To explore whether diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) can localize specific segments of primary motor areas in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS)</z:e>, this study investigated the corticospinal tract (CST) between precentral gyrus (PCG) and posterior limb of internal capsule (PIC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: DWI was performed on 32 healthy children and seven children with unilateral SWS affecting the sensorimotor area variably </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A hierarchical dendrogram was applied to find PCG-segments uniquely connected to PIC-segments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The resulting PCG-clusters were used to image primary motor pathways in DWI and find <z:mp ids='MP_0005266'>metabolic abnormalities</z:mp> of primary motor areas in <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography (PET) scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In healthy children, five PCG-clusters were found to have unique CST courses, corresponding to CST segments of mouth/lip, fingers, and leg/ankle primary motor areas determined by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In children with SWS, reduced streamlines in these PCG clusters were highly correlated with <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-hypometabolism on PET (R(2) = 0.2312, P = 0.0032) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Impaired CST segment corresponding to finger movements correlated with severity of hand motor deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The presented method can detect impaired CST segments corresponding to specific motor functions in young children who cannot cooperate for fMRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This approach can be clinically useful for a noninvasive presurgical evaluation of cortical motor areas in such children </plain></SENT>
