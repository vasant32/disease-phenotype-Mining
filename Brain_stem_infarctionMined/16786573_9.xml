<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To investigate physiological alterations in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS)</z:e> using <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> perfusion imaging (PWI) and proton spectroscopic imaging (MRSI), and their association with neurological status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Six consecutive patients with a clinically established diagnosis of SWS underwent MRI using a 1.5 Tesla scanner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The protocol consisted of conventional anatomic scans, dynamic PWI, and multislice MRSI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A pediatric neurologist evaluated the neurological scores, and the imaging results were correlated with neurological scores using nonparametric correlation analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two patients had classic neuroimaging findings of unilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002059'>cerebral atrophy</z:hpo> with corresponding leptomeningeal enhancement and hypoperfusion (prolonged mean transit time) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two patients had bilateral disease, and two had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> symmetric perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among clinical measures, the highest correlation was between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> index and hypoperfused tissue volume (Spearman's correlation coefficient, rho = 0.943, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was also a trend of correlation, although not statistically significant (P = 0.06), between the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> score and the <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>/Cr ratio in the mid to posterior centrum semiovale, lateral gray matter (GM), and splenium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In SWS, PWI indicates <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1695782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral hypoperfusion</z:e> predominantly due to impaired venous drainage, with only the most severely affected regions in some patients also showing arterial perfusion deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The extent and severity of the perfusion abnormality and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo>/dysfunction reflect the severity of neurological symptoms and disability, and the highest correlation is found with the degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These parameters may be useful as quantitative measures of disease burden; however, further studies in larger number of patients (and with a more homogeneous age range) are required to confirm the preliminary findings reported here </plain></SENT>
