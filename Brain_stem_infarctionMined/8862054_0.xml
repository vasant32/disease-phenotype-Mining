<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography (PET) in aiding in the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brainstem infarctions</z:e> that cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0000496'>abnormal eye movements</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Cerebral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism was examined by PET with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49134">18F-fluorodeoxyglucose</z:chebi> as a tracer in five <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control subjects and six patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000496'>abnormal eye movements</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The PET images were registered to and superimposed on magnetic resonance images (MRIs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> control subjects showed little asymmetry of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism in the brainstem, whereas <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> six patients demonstrated areas of low <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism in the brainstem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Areas of low metabolism seen by PET were wider than they appeared to be by MRI; MRIs even appeared <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in some patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Asymmetry index measurements at the level of the ischemic lesion ranged between 19% and 45% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">Positron</z:chebi> emission tomography detected metabolic abnormality in patients with brainstem lesions that caused <z:hpo ids='HP_0000496'>abnormal eye movements</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Superimposing PET images on MRIs accurately localized abnormally low metabolism in the brainstem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Combined imaging with PET and MRI can be used to diagnose ischemic lesions in the brainstem from functional (PET) and morphologic (MRI) viewpoints </plain></SENT>
