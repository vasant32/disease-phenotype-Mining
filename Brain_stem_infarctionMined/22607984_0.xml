<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to assess the respiratory mechanics components that might be associated with the success of extubation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> who needed mechanical ventilation support were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The maximal inspiratory pressure, gastric and the esophageal pressure (Pdi/Pdimax), minute volume, respiratory rate, static compliance, airway resistance, rapid and superficial respiration index (RSRI), inspiratory time/total respiratory cycle (Ti/Ttot), and PaO(2)/FiO(2) were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The group who presented success to the extubation process presented 12.5±2.2=days in mechanical ventilation and the group who failed presented 13.1±2=days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean Ti/Ttot and Pdi/Pdimax for the failure group was 0.4±0.08 (0.36-0.44) and 0.5±0.7 (0.43-0.56), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Ti/Ttot ratio was 0.37±0.05 (0.34-0.41; p=0.0008) and the Pdi/Pdimax was 0.25±0.05 for the success group (0.21-0.28; p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A correlation was found between Pdi/Pdimax ratio and the RSRI (r=0.55; p=0.009) and PaO(2)/FiO(2) (r=-0.59; p=0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients who presented a high RSRI (OR, 3.66; p=0.004) and Pdi (OR, 7.3; p=0.002), and low PaO(2)/FIO(2) (OR, 4.09; p=0.007), Pdi/Pdimax (OR, 4.12; p=0.002) and RAW (OR, 3.0; p=0.02) developed mechanical ventilation extubation failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Muscular <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> index is an important predicting variable to the extubation process in prolonged mechanical ventilation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
