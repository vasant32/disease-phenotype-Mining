<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are few diagnostic procedures which are of benefit for the evaluation of brainstem ischemic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Brainstem auditory evoked responses (BAERs) are a new electrophysiologic technique for assessing brainstem function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the use of BAERs in patients with brainstem ischemic events, 35 individuals with recent brainstem <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, selected by strict clinical criteria, were evaluated with BAERs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The initial BAER was abnormal in 22 of 35 patients (63%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When the clinical course and site of the lesion are correlated with the BAER results, several trends emerge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An unstable course, characterized by progression or remission and relapse, was present in 19/35 (54%) of patients, and 15/19 (79%) of these individuals had an initially abnormal BAER </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The other 16 brainstem <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with a stable clinical course had an initially abnormal BAER in 7 instances (44%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This difference is statistically significant at the p = 0.04 level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The principal sites of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> were mesencephalic in 11/35, pontine in 13/35, and medullary in 11/35 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The association of an abnormal BAER with an unstable clinical course seemed independent of the site of the lesion, However, of the 9 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> that occurred, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> were in patients with mesencephalic or pontine lesions, and 8 of these individuals had an initially abnormal BAER </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Abnormal BAERs in patients with brainstem ischemic lesions correlate with an unstable clinical course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, individuals with pontomesencephalic infarction and abnormal BAERs have an especially poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The BAER may be of prognostic value in the early evaluation of patients with brainstem <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
