<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Small <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in the territory of penetrator arteries were described as causing a number of distinct clinical syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The vascular pathophysiology underlying such <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> is difficult to ascertain without careful pathological study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the occurrence of multiple, small <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, linked closely in time but dispersed widely in the brain, raises the possibility of an embolic mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The current study determines the frequency and clinical characteristics of patients with well-defined lacunar syndromes and the diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) evidence of multiple <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty-two consecutive patients who presented to the emergency room with a clinically well-defined lacunar syndrome were studied by DWI within the first 3 days of admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: DWI showed multiple regions of increased signal intensity in 10 patients (16%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A hemispheric or brain stem lesion in a penetrator territory that accounted for the clinical syndrome ("index lesion") was found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DWI-hyperintense lesions other than the index lesion ("subsidiary infarctions") were punctate and lay within leptomeningeal artery territories in the majority </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As opposed to patients with a single <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e>, patients with a subsidiary infarction more frequently (P&lt;0.05) harbored an identifiable cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Almost 1 of every 6 patients presenting with a classic lacunar syndrome has multiple infarctions demonstrated on DWI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This DWI finding usually indicates an identifiable cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and therefore may influence clinical decisions regarding the extent of etiologic investigations and treatment for secondary prevention </plain></SENT>
