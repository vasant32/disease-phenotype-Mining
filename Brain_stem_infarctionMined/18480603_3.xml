<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We wanted to identify an easy-to-use pre-treatment <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>-based predictor of clinical outcome in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> BA occlusion treated with IAT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed 16 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> BA occlusion prospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Vascular risk factors, as well as National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) and Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Scale (GCS) scores were recorded on admission, together with a 10-point semiquantitative score reflecting the number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischaemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> on diffusion-weighted imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The recanalization grade was evaluated by angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The clinical outcome, using the modified Rankin scale (mRs), was measured 3 months later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Risk factors, NIHSS and GCS scores, time from symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> to treatment, recanalization rate, outcome and outcome predictors (such as age, NIHSS and GCS scores) were comparable to other studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Haemorrhagic transformation of infarction occurred in 2 patients (12.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We found that a high lesion score was an additional predictor of poor outcome (p = 0.026) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> BA occlusion, treated with intra-arterial recombinant tissue plasminogen activator, a high number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischaemic lesions, based on diffusion-weighted imaging, is a predictor of poor clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
