<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The case fatality rate was 23%, higher than for any other location of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> studied over the same period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>Death</z:hpo> was most often due to concomitant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brainstem infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Obstructive <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> occurred in 4 patients (13%), and in 2 cases diagnosis, facilitated by urgent CT scanning, allowed early surgical intervention that was life saving </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients who survived the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase were followed for an average of 21 months, and over that time 22% sustained further <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brainstem infarction</z:e>, representing a 13% <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate per year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Over the latter 3 years of the clinical study, an autopsy survey revealed 11 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0236073" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebellar infarction</z:e> that had been clinically unrecognized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>None of these died as a direct result of their infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mechanisms of infarction inferred from autopsy included in situ <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, embolism, watershed, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333559" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lacunar infarction</z:e>, with in situ <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> being the most common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the case fatality rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0236073" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebellar infarction</z:e> is greater than of any other form of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>, but it may be reduced by prompt recognition of those patients who will benefit from surgical decompression </plain></SENT>
