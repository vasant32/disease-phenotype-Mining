<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated clinicopathologic features, associated conditions, immunohistochemistry, and outcome in 59 LPB identified from surgical pathology and consultation files </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pathology materials, cytogenetics reports, and medical records were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry for S100 protein, CD34, and Mib-1 was performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue using standard techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fifty-nine patients had 74 samples, including 14 patients with one or more with local recurrences among the 30 patients who had available follow-up information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were 37 males and 22 females (ratio 1.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Age at diagnosis ranged from 3 months to 16 years with 22% in the first year, 68% at 1 to 9 years, and 10% at 10 to 16 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sixty-four percent arose on the trunk, 27% on the extremities, and 8% in the head/neck </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Forty-six percent had one or more recurrences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> diameter ranged from 1.2 to 15.5 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The white to yellow cut surface showed variable lobulation and myxoid change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Histologically, nodules of adipose and myxoid tissue were demarcated by bands of fibrous tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The cells displayed a range of differentiation from multivacuolated lipoblasts to mature adipocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Mitoses were nonexistent to rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Histologic variations included a subtle zonal architecture of fat maturation, abundant myxoid material, primitive mesenchymal cells, a focal plexiform vascular pattern, and multinucleated cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases tested were immunoreactive for S100 and CD34; Mib-1 reactivity was absent to low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic aberrations included chromosome 8 abnormalities in 8 cases, nonspecific numerical abnormalities in 1 case, and a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype in 1 case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Ten patients had other medical conditions including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000256'>macrocephaly</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>developmental delay</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo>, congenital anomalies, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome</z:e>, or a family history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001012'>multiple lipomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>In summary, this large series of LPB demonstrates its occurrence in older children and adolescents, documents a recurrence rate of 46% and confirms that the degree of adipocytic differentiation does not predict biologic behavior </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>An unexpected finding was the presence in 17% of patients of central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system disorders such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000717'>autism</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>developmental delay</z:hpo>, congenital anomalies, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome</z:e>, or a family history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0012032'>lipomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>These observations raise the question of whether predisposing genetic or other constitutional factors contribute to the development of LPB or whether LPB is indicative of a syndrome </plain></SENT>
