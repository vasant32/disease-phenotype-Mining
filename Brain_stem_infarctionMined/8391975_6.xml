<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Distal colectomy is curative but the formation of a colostomy is undesirable in patients who already have a poor self-image due to the other manifestations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022739" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="KTS">Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome</z:e> such as multiple cutaneous hemangiomata, severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002619'>varicose veins</z:hpo>, and prominent limb <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Endoscopic laser ablation alone is often not feasible in these patients because of the extensive and often circumferential nature of the colonic hemangiomata </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Case 1 demonstrates that endoscopic laser ablation of the diseased colonic mucosa, while not feasible with the extensive involvement of the left colon, was very effective when combined with partial colectomy at curing the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> while maintaining anal sphincter function </plain></SENT>
