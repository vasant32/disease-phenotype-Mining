<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>Seizures</z:hpo> began at 1 day to 14 months (mean, 4.0 months) after birth, occurred frequently (often many times per day, and were refractory to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">antiepileptic</z:chebi> drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were evaluated for surgery at 2.5-24 (mean 12.4) months of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seven patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> and eight had slowed cognitive development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>Seizures</z:hpo> were characterized by arrest or marked reduction of behavioral motor activity with nuclear level of consciousness (n = 4, with temporal or temporoparietal EEG <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>), focal clonic activity (n = 3, with perirolandic EEG <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>), generalized tonic stiffening (n = 3, with temporoparieto-occipital, parietal, or frontal EEG <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>), or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037769" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infantile spasms</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002521'>hypsarrhythmia</z:hpo> (n = 2, with a frontal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> or temporoparieto-occipital <z:hpo ids='HP_0002539'>cortical dysplasia</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed the epileptogenic lesion in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but two patients, both with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002539'>cortical dysplasia</z:hpo> localized by interictal <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi>-emission tomography (PET) and other clinical or EEG features and confirmed on histopathologic examination of resected tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At follow-up 4-86 (mean 32) months after surgery, six patients were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> free (Engel outcome class I), three had rare <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> with none in at least the previous 6 months (Engel class II), and two had worthwhile improvement (Engel class III) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Except for the severely developmentally delayed infant with <z:hpo ids='HP_0007206'>hemimegalencephaly</z:hpo>, several patients had marked "catch-up" developmental progress after class I, II, or III outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Postoperative complications included <z:hpo ids='HP_0100309'>subdural hematoma</z:hpo> over the contralateral hemisphere (one patient) and entrapment and enlargement of the ipsilateral temporal horn (one patient) after hemispherectomy, both corrected uneventfully with a second surgical procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One patient died of unexplained causes several hours after frontal lobectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No patients had new neurologic deficits after surgery, and one patient had resolution of progressive fluctuating <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> after resection of temporoparieto-occipital <z:hpo ids='HP_0002539'>cortical dysplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results agree with previous reports that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> surgery can provide relief from catastrophic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> in carefully selected infants </plain></SENT>
