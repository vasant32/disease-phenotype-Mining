<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies suggested that unilateral pontomedullary brainstem lesions cause ipsiversive roll-tilt of SVV, whereas pontomesencephalic lesions cause contraversive roll-tilts of SVV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, previous data were of limited quality and lacked a statistical approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We therefore tested roll-tilt of the SVV in 79 human patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> unilateral brainstem lesions due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> by applying modern statistical lesion-behavior mapping analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Roll-tilt of the SVV was verified to be a brainstem sign, and for the first time it was confirmed statistically that lesions of the medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF) and the medial vestibular nucleus are associated with ipsiversive tilt of the SVV, whereas contraversive tilts are associated with lesions affecting the rostral interstitial nucleus of the MLF, the superior cerebellar peduncle, the oculomotor nucleus, and the interstitial nucleus of Cajal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, these structures constitute the anatomical pathway in the brainstem for verticality perception </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Present data indicate that graviceptive otolith signals present a predominant role in the multisensory system of verticality perception </plain></SENT>
