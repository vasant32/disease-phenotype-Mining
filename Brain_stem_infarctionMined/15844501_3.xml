<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000421'>Epistaxis</z:hpo> is the most common symptom of a complex, genetically determined vasculopathy, which is known under the notion hereditary hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001009'>telangiectasia</z:hpo> (HHT, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039445" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Rendu-Osler-Weber-syndrome</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was initiated to gain more knowledge about the natural history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000421'>epistaxis</z:hpo> in a German HHT-population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data of 49 HHT patients were ascertained by interviewing these patients with a standardized disease specific questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients' files were retrospectively reviewed for data concerning age, gender, past medical history, laboratory parameters, number of hospital admissions for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000421'>epistaxis</z:hpo>, conservative and operative types of therapy, treatment results and follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MAIN RESULT: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000421'>Epistaxis</z:hpo> was the first and most prominent symptom in 93% of the patients and could be triggered most frequently by stress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Half of the patients had experienced first episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000421'>epistaxis</z:hpo> in childhood, but usually <z:hpo ids='HP_0000421'>epistaxis</z:hpo> did not become troublesome before the age of 35 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The effects of hormonal changes or therapies with systemic hormones were inconclusive with regard to impact on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000421'>epistaxis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with septal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforations</z:mpath> had to be admitted for inpatient <z:hpo ids='HP_0000421'>epistaxis</z:hpo> treatment more frequently than patients with an intact nasal septum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An overall reduction of frequency and intensity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000421'>epistaxis</z:hpo> could be achieved in 89% of the patients through the daily use of nasal lubricants and a minimum of two treatment sessions with the Nd:YAG laser </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However in none of the cases the treatment results were permanent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>More than 50% of the patients, who had been screened for visceral <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformations</z:hpo>, were positive for pathologic vascular lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>PRINCIPAL CONCLUSION: The natural history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000421'>epistaxis</z:hpo> in German HHT patients is similar to previously described entities from other parts of the world </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>First clinical signs of HHT may be present at an earlier age than previously thought </plain></SENT>
