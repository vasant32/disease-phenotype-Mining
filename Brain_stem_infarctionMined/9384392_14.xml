<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirty-nine <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> arose at the BA bifurcation, 11 at the origin of the superior cerebellar artery (SCA), and two from the upper BA trunk just below the SCA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patient population consisted of 36 women and 13 men, with a mean age of 50 years (range 23-74 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the 35 patients presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, 10 were Grade I, 10 were Grade II, 11 were Grade III, and four were Grade IV according to the Hunt and Hess scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment consisted of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> neck clipping in 28, proximal occlusion of the BA in three, and endovascular therapy with coils in four patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The remaining 14 patients with unruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> underwent direct neck clipping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Postoperatively, 38 patients developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000651'>diplopia</z:hpo> in at least one direction of gaze but this had resolved in 31 of them at the last follow-up evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were four <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (8.2%): two as a result of rebleeding following coil compaction at 8 days and 9 months posttreatment, respectively; one as a result of vasospasm; and one as a result of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brainstem infarction</z:e> after proximal occlusion of the BA in a giant bifurcation <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the surviving patients, 33 (67.3%) made an excellent recovery, seven (14.3%) made a good recovery, and five (10.2%) were in poor condition at the last follow-up review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Direct microsurgical clipping of most <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of the BA apex region can be performed with acceptable rates of morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data from an unselected series of patients in a general hospital provide a basis for comparison with developing alternative techniques </plain></SENT>
