<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To report and discuss a case of post-traumatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100310'>epidural hematoma</z:hpo> of the craniocervical junction with concomitant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain stem infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Post-traumatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100310'>epidural hematoma</z:hpo> of the cervical spine and brain stem post-traumatic infarction are very <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0678236" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rare disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Post-traumatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100310'>epidural hematoma</z:hpo> is usually located dorsally in the epidural space </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The clinical, neuroradiologic, and neurophysiologic findings in one patient with post-traumatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100310'>epidural hematoma</z:hpo> located ventrally at the cervicomedullary junction and associated with medial infarction at the pontomedullary junction are reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The main clinical finding in this patient was bilateral corticospinal and corticobulbar tract involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A magnetic resonance image showed displacement and flattening of the medulla oblongata and of the most cranial portion of cervical cord, which were caused by the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100310'>epidural hematoma</z:hpo> associated with an ischemic lesion of the pontomedullary junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results of central motor conduction studies indicated that the abnormality of the central motor pathways was localized at brain stem level, and that there was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> conduction from the cervicomedullary junction to spinal cord </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This is the first reported case of spinal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100310'>epidural hematoma</z:hpo> located ventrally in the cervical spine at the cervicomedullary junction level and concomitant infarction at the pontomedullary junction resulting from whiplash injury </plain></SENT>
