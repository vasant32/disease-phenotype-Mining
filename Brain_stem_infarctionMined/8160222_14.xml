<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study our purpose was to assess quantitatively autonomic cardiovascular disturbances in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> by measuring cardiovascular autonomic reflexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied the autonomic regulation of cardiovascular functions prospectively in 40 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase, 1 month, and 6 months) and in 55 healthy control subjects by recording heart rate and blood pressure responses to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and deep breathing, the Valsalva maneuver, tilting, and isometric work </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase, heart rate responses to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> breathing, deep breathing, the Valsalva maneuver, and tilting were significantly (P &lt; .05) impaired in both hemispheric and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain stem infarctions</z:e>, thus indicating hypofunction of the parasympathetic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At 1 month heart rate responses to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> breathing (brain stem, P &lt; .05), the Valsalva maneuver (brain stem, P &lt; .01), and tilting (hemispheric, P &lt; .05) were still significantly lower than those of the control subjects, but at 6 months significant suppression of the response was found only in tilting (hemispheric, P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that in addition to the previously well-established sympathetic hyperfunction, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> also seems to cause parasympathetic hypofunction, brain which may be involved in cardiovascular and other known manifestations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0393911" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">autonomic failure</z:e> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
