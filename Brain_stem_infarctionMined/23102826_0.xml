<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Laryngeal manifestations of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> play a significant role in the morbidity and mortality among affected patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this article was to describe unique myoclonic vocal fold <z:hpo ids='HP_0100022'>movement disorder</z:hpo>, which is an unusual post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> manifestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective case study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: The study group included post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> who were referred to the Swallowing Clinic at Edith Wolfson Medical Center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent flexible laryngoscopy and flexible endoscopic evaluation of swallowing with sensory testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The vocal fold movement was analyzed with the Sisson-Ammons video analysis system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Three post-pontine <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients presented with vocal fold <z:hpo ids='HP_0001336'>myoclonus</z:hpo> (VFM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001336'>myoclonus</z:hpo> was spontaneous, unintentional, and irregular (19-420 jerks per minute) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two patients presented with unilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001336'>myoclonus</z:hpo>, ipsilateral to the brainstem <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One patient, who experienced subsequent pontine <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, presented with bilateral VFM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>When patients were asked to swallow or phonate, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001336'>myoclonus</z:hpo> disappeared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Isolated VFM is an unusual manifestation of pontine injury, resulting in a sudden, involuntary, and non-rhythmic vocal fold movement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This laryngeal pathology is not associated with either <z:hpo ids='HP_0002094'>dyspnea</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001618'>dysphonia</z:hpo> and most likely not with inefficient swallowing </plain></SENT>
