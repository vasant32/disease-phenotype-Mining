<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to identify the risk factor profiles, subtypes and recurrence of non-cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> for the two largest subpopulations, the Arab and South Asians, at the only <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-admitting hospital in Qatar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients admitted to Hamad Medical Corporation from January through December 2001 were reviewed in January 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Only patients with non-cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and complete work-up were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 303 patients with ischemic non-cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> fit the entry criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sixty seven percent of the overall patient population (sex ratio 2:6, M/F) was of Arab origin, and 32% were South Asians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> was the most commonly encountered risk factor followed by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Significant differences between the Arab and South Asian subgroup of patients were observed with respect to number of risk factors and occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Carotid artery stenotic lesions, ventricular wall motion abnormalities and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrence were observed with a higher frequency in the Arab subgroup of patients compared with the South Asians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The majority of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> were lacunar hemispheric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> (68%), followed by lacunar brainstem <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> (15%) and large-vessel hemispheric infarctions (10%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with a previous history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> had a higher frequency of carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> (p = 0.05) and risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrence (p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Unlike in other studies originating from the Arabian Gulf, lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is the most common subtype of non-cardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in both the Arabs and South Asians in Qatar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Significant ethnic differences in age of occurrence, risk factor profile, and cardiovascular variables were observed </plain></SENT>
