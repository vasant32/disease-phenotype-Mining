<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Extracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, proximal to the carotid bifurcation and V3 segment of the vertebral artery, is considered to be an infrequent condition with a benign prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, its prevalence may be underestimated due to lack of data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to determine the prevalence of proximal extracranial plaques and stenosis in the common carotid artery, innominate and subclavian arteries, and proximal vertebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a systematic analysis of intra- and extracranial arteries, the aortic arch, and the heart in 339 consecutive autopsies of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>; 259 patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e>; 80 patients had brain <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> and were used as control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical history, risk factors, imaging data, and general autopsy reports were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Proximal extracranial plaques and stenosis were present in the arteries of 46.9% and 19.8% of patients, respectively, without a significant difference between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarction</z:e> and brain <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Proximal extracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> occurred more frequently in the proximal vertebral artery than in other arteries (stenosis prevalence 12.7% versus 5.3% in the common carotid artery) and in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751953" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">posterior circulation brain infarction</z:e> (except for the posterior cerebral artery territory) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>More specifically, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in the proximal vertebral artery was significantly associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751953" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">posterior circulation brain infarction</z:e> (age- and sex-adjusted OR, 2.31; 95% CI, 1.28 to 4.17 for plaques and 2.10; 95% CI, 1.01 to 4.38 for stenosis) using patients with isolated anterior circulation infarctions as control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Proximal extracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> was frequent and was significantly associated with brainstem <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings support the importance of a systematic workup, including the evaluation of proximal extracranial <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
