<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There has been no systematic study that carefully investigates the characteristic features of abnormal cervical vestibular-evoked myogenic potential (cVEMP) response associated with the AICA territory infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To investigate the frequency, the characteristic patterns of abnormal cVEMP associated with AICA territory infarction, and the crucial site for producing abnormal cVEMP response in the AICA territory infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 16 consecutive cases of unilateral AICA territory infarction diagnosed by brain MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>VEMP was induced by a short click sound and was recorded in contracting sternocleidomastoid muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each patient underwent a quantitative audiovestibular evaluation, including bithermal caloric test and pure tone audiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eight patients (50%) exhibited abnormal cVEMP response on the side of the AICA territory infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with abnormal cVEMP showed an absent or decreased response in amplitude but no difference in latency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with abnormal VEMP were significantly more likely to have canal <z:mp ids='MP_0000754'>paresis</z:mp> (CP), <z:mp ids='MP_0004740'>sensorineural hearing loss</z:mp>, or both compared with patients who had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cVEMP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Conversely, abnormal cVEMP was more frequently observed among patients with CP than among those without CP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in lesion sites according to brain MRI among patients with or without abnormal cVEMP response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the peripheral vestibular structure with the inner ear probably plays a crucial role in producing abnormal cVEMP response associated with AICA territory infarction </plain></SENT>
