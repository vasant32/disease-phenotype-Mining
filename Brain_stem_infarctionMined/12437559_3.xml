<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The term <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022283" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">hypomelanosis of Ito</z:e> (HI) is applied to individuals with skin <z:hpo ids='HP_0001010'>hypopigmentation</z:hpo> following the lines of Blaschko (type 1a of patterns indicative of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001442'>somatic mosaicism</z:hpo> as defined by Happle) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Even though originally described as a purely cutaneous disease, subsequent reports of HI have included a 30-94% association with multiple extracutaneous manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The frequency of extracutaneous associations has led many authors to consider HI to be neurocutaneous disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report a male infant with cutaneous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162835" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypomelanosis</z:e> along the lines of Blaschko distributed on the left half of the body who developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002133'>status epilepticus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neuroimaging studies disclosed an angiomatous enlargement of the right choroid plexus and a gyral pattern of cortical and subcortical calcification in the right occipital region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus a diagnosis could be made of HI and associated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome</z:e>-like leptomeningeal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002992,C1411989" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">angiomatosis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This previously unreported association lends further support to the consideration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022283" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">hypomelanosis of Ito</z:e> as a marker of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001442'>somatic mosaicism</z:hpo> with frequently associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000707'>neurologic abnormalities</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A relationship between HI and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome</z:e>, two neuroectodermal disorders with a genetic mosaicism basis, might be possible due to nonallelic twin-spotting which in the embryologic period would define an abnormal development of neural, vascular, and cutaneous structures </plain></SENT>
