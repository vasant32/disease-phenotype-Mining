<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Each intramural clot localization determines different clinical form </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We present the clinical observations carried out in two patients with vertebrobasilar dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> and we review the state of the art of this process to remark the early identification of these unusual lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORTS: Two cases of vertebrobasilar dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They were young patients that debuted, one as posteroinferior artery brain steam infarction and the other one as a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> caused by a right posterior cerebral artery dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Lesions were confirmed by helicoidal cerebral angiotomographic and angiograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This patient was operated on and we clipped the posterior communicating that irrigated dissecting segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We carry out an anatomical and hemodynamic analysis of that lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both patients had a satisfactory clinical evolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Dissecting intramural <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematomas</z:mp> of the vertebrobasilar territory are frequent cause of young people ictus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested that the ictus may happen after minor head trauma and pain, main symptom, always precedes neurological dysfunction signs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Hemorrhagic presentation has a high incidence of rebleeding and elevated mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It always requires, as soon as possible, direct microsurgical treatment or endovascular methods (coils) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Most useful microsurgical procedure, until today, is parent artery clipping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This technique has a low index of isquemic and neural postoperative damage </plain></SENT>
