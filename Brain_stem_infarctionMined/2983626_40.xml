<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Elongation of the impaired limb was invariably found while <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> was present in 84%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002619'>varicose veins</z:hpo> in 36%, and flat angiomata in 32% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Venography and surgical exploration have demonstrated malformation of the deep veins involving the popliteal vein in 51%; superficial femoral vein, 16%; both popliteal and superficial femoral veins; 29%; iliac veins, three per cent; and lower vena cava, one per cent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Good clinical results have been achieved following the surgical release of these deep veins in the lower limb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During childhood, when the difference in limb length is noteworthy, ligature of the popliteal vein of the shorter limb induces a compensating elongation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Klippel and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Tr</z:e>énaunay's syndrome may be associated with lymphatic malformations, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001004'>lymphedema</z:hpo> and malformation of the lymph vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Knowledge of the pathophysiology of these malformations of the deep veins enables a better understanding of the clinical manifestations of the condition, as well as the improved treatment of the serious vesical or <z:mp ids='MP_0003293'>rectal hemorrhage</z:mp> which occurs in one per cent of these patients </plain></SENT>
