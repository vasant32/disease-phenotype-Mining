<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to examine the use of fully supported open stent grafting (OSG) with a Matsui-Kitamura (MK) stent for treatment of distal arch <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> (DAA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Surgery was performed using a newly developed device in seven DAA patients (six men and one woman) from 58 to 86 years of age (mean, 73 years old) from August 2005 to June 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aorta was transected at the arch between bracheocephalic artery and left subclavian artery under <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> with total cardiopulmonary bypass and selective cerebral perfusion; then the stent grafting (SG) system was inserted and positioned with a 14 Fr. pusher </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The SG and a transected edge were then sutured and anastomosed with the arch graft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The surgery was completed by constructing three cerebral branches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean SG diameter and length were 34.6 mm (range, 32-38 mm) and 150 mm (120-200 mm), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean time of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> time and surgery were 41 min (35-55 min) and 358 min (269-450 min), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Simultaneous mitral valve replacement was performed in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> surgeries were completed successfully, and complete <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002385'>Paraparesis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>respiratory failure</z:hpo> occurred in one patient each, and one patient died of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brainstem infarction</z:e> 1 month after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These initial results suggest that the OSG method is a useful surgical procedure for the treatment of DAA </plain></SENT>
