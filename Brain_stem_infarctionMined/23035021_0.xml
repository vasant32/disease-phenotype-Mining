<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate if markers of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> were associated with risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the general elderly population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was part of the large population-based Rotterdam Study and included 5,234 participants who were aged 55 years or older and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> free and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> free at baseline (1997-2001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fasting insulin levels and homeostasis model assessment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> were used as markers for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cox regression was used to determine associations between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> markers and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk, adjusted for age, sex, and potential confounders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During 42,806 person-years of follow-up (median: 8.6 years), 366 first-ever <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> occurred, of which 225 were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarctions</z:e>, 42 were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhages</z:hpo>, and 99 were unspecified <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fasting insulin levels were not associated with risk of any <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Homeostasis model assessment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo>, which almost perfectly correlated with fasting insulin levels, was also not associated with risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes </plain></SENT>
