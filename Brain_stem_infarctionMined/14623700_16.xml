<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Surgery is difficult and frequently unsuccessful, radiological intervention with embolization has an ill-defined role, and conventional sclerotherapy has little to offer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of sclerosant in microfoam form in treating congenital venous malformations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A retrospective study of medical records, pretreatment and posttreatment color photographs, echo-Doppler ultrasonographic results, and/or magnetic resonance imaging in patients with congenital vascular malformations of venous predominance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Follow-up ranged from 6 to 103 months (mean, 30 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Private vascular surgery clinic in Granada, Spain, and dermatology department at a university hospital in Pamplona </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients The study population comprised 50 patients, 19 with limited venous malformations, 16 with infiltrating venous malformations, and 15 with Klippel-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Tr</z:e>Ã©naunay syndrome.Intervention Percutaneous sclerotherapy by direct injection of 0.25% to 4% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46859">polidocanol</z:chebi> microfoam under <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">du</z:e>-plex ultrasonographic guidance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The number of sessions varied between 1 and 46 (mean, 12 sessions) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The primary efficacy end point was defined as a reduction in size after completion of the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>Sclerosis</z:mp> therapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46859">polidocanol</z:chebi> microfoam was judged beneficial in 46 (92%) of the 50 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Among the 46 responders, 18 showed disappearance of treated malformations, 15 showed a reduction in malformation size of more than 50%, and 13 showed a reduction in malformation size of 50% or less </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Of the 39 patients who presented with pain, the pain disappeared in 25 and was reduced in 14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No major adverse effects were reported by any patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There were 4 cases of transient skin <z:hpo ids='HP_0001000'>pigmentation</z:hpo> and 3 cases of skin <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Color echo-Doppler ultrasonography-guided sclerotherapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46859">polidocanol</z:chebi> microfoam was effective in 46 (92%) of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The technique is delivered on a strictly ambulatory basis and has proved simple and innocuous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The quality and durability of the outcome make this novel procedure the treatment of choice in the care of patients with congenital venous malformations </plain></SENT>
