<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We reported a 20-year-old female of intractable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0393691" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">occipital lobe epilepsy</z:e> associated with calcification in the left occipital lobe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>She developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> since 2 years old and electroencephalography showed paroxysmal activities on the left occipital area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At 8 years old, partial resection of the lesion and interictal spike focus under intraoperative corticography guidance was performed, but the favorable <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> outcome was not obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At the age of 20 years old, the frequency of her <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> has increased and admitted to our department </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Preoperative evaluation with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> invasive subdural recording showed that the ictal zone was located in the inferior (tentorial) surface and convexity of the left occipital lobe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Functional mapping involving cortical stimulation and cortical recording of pattern-reversal visual evoked potentials demonstrated that the ictal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> zone was not in the visual area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Following cortical resection of the ictal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> zone and multiple subpial transection on the surrounding cortex, she had good relief with less than one minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> per 1-3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Histological findings of the resected specimen were consistent with those of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> invasive subdural recording may improve <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> outcome in patients whose epileptogenic area was located near the visual field </plain></SENT>
