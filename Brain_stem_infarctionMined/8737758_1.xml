<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: A randomized double-blind controlled trial of doxapram versus placebo against late postoperative hypoxaemia was planned to include 40 patients (2 x 20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After inclusion of 18 patients a serious adverse event was encountered with development of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain stem infarction</z:e> in a 90-year-old woman receiving doxapram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At this point the randomization code was broken and we decided to terminate the trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three of nine patients receiving doxapram had had an adverse event whereas none of the patients receiving placebo had adverse events (P = 0.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the 18 patients studied, there was an insignificant trend towards higher mean oxygen saturation in the doxapram group, and a significantly higher minimum oxygen saturation and reduced number of hypoxaemic events on the first postoperative night </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although these preliminary data on the effect of doxapram on postoperative hypoxaemia seem promising, further studies on the effect of continuous nocturnal postoperative doxapram infusion on levels of arterial oxygen saturation should be postponed until more knowledge about the pharmacokinetics of doxapram in this particular clinical situation has been gathered </plain></SENT>
