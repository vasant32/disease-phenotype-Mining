<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the study was to establish the role of VEMP in patients with brainstem <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002321'>vertigo</z:hpo> were admitted and underwent a battery of auditory vestibular tests including caloric and VEMP tests; then they were surveyed by magnetic resonance imaging scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seven patients (two men and five women) were demonstrated as having brainstem <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, including infarction in five patients and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> in two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Clinical manifestations consisted of dizziness/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002321'>vertigo</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, spontaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000639'>nystagmus</z:hpo> in five (71%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> in three </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No patients had experienced conscious change or conventional neurological deficits (eg, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002423'>long tract signs</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Electronystagmography revealed abnormal findings on eye tracking test in 100% of patients, on optokinetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000639'>nystagmus</z:hpo> test in 71% of the patients, and on caloric testing in 10 ears (71%), including absent ice-water caloric test response in 7 ears and canal <z:mp ids='MP_0000754'>paresis</z:mp> in 3 ears </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Vestibular evoked myogenic potential testing displayed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> response in 3 ears and abnormal response in 11 ears (79%), including <z:mp ids='MP_0004745'>absent vestibular evoked myogenic potentials</z:mp> in 8 ears and delayed vestibular evoked myogenic potentials in 3 ears </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When results of both caloric testing and VEMP test were combined, the abnormal rate increased to 93% (13 of 14 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Caloric testing assesses the vestibulo-ocular reflex, which passes upward through the upper brainstem, whereas VEMP testing evaluates the sacculocollic reflex, which travels downward through the lower brainstem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Hence, in evaluating the extension of brainstem <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, both caloric and VEMP testing should be performed </plain></SENT>
