<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An abnormal Q-Tc interval (greater than 0.44 sec) was found in 18% of S and in 8% of the control subjects (p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These abnormalities in S were more common at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the disease (18%) than from 3 weeks after the development of focal signs (9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An abnormal Q-Tc interval was found in 18% of NLI (8 of 44 cases) and in 18% of NLI (10 of 56 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Regarding the topography of the lesions, an abnormal Q-Tc interval was found in 20% (3 of 15 cases) of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brainstem infarctions</z:e>; in 19% of the infarctions of basal ganglia (9 of 47 cases) and in 13% (4 of 30 cases) of hemispheral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results show that the abnormalities of Q-Tc interval in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> are not uncommon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>They may be reversible and in some cases they are related with the topography of the cerebral lesion </plain></SENT>
