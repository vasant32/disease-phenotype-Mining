<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 55-year-old hypertensive man developed right <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> with slight <z:hpo ids='HP_0001260'>dysarthria</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo> upon awaking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The right side of his face and right upper limb and trunk to the level of the Th8-9 territory showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000975'>hyperhidrosis</z:hpo>, which disappeared in a week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ocular motor examination revealed that during forward gaze with the left eye fixing, the right eye deviated outward </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient was able to adduct the right eye to midposition with the right eye fixing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rightward gaze elicited full abduction and right-beating <z:hpo ids='HP_0000639'>nystagmus</z:hpo> of the right eye, but the left eye did not adduct </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When he attempted to gaze leftward, both eyes made the full excursion, but saccades were slow in that direction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Convergence was intact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Vertical gaze was full, and he did not show Horner's sign </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This ocular sign, non-paralytic pontine <z:hpo ids='HP_0000577'>exotropia</z:hpo>, disappeared three days later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>T2-weighted spin echo magnetic resonance imaging disclosed a small lesion with high intensity in the inner side of the left middle pons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This <z:hpo ids='HP_0000975'>hyperhidrosis</z:hpo> was thought to be caused by destruction of inhibitory fibers thermoregulating <z:hpo ids='HP_0000975'>sweating</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that at the level of the middle pons inhibitory fibers descend along the inner side of facilitatory fibers thermoregulating <z:hpo ids='HP_0000975'>sweating</z:hpo>, which are speculated to descend the dorso-lateral part of the pontine tegmentum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These findings also suggest that lesions of non-paralytic pontine <z:hpo ids='HP_0000577'>exotropia</z:hpo> may be located in the paramedian pontine reticular formation rostral to the abducens nucleus with ipsilateral medial longitudinal fasciculus lesion, but further investigation is necessary </plain></SENT>
