<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, recent availability of non-invasive diagnostic techniques, such as the transcranial Doppler (TCD), has increased the frequency with which this anomaly is diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we present the case of a young woman affected by post-partum peripheral <z:hpo ids='HP_0010628'>facial palsy</z:hpo>: further exams disclosed not only its truncal-ischaemic origin, but also, significantly, the presence of <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp>, as well as of anticardiolipin antibodies (acL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Given the increased embolic risk in labouring women, this study highlights the importance of searching for <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> in case of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> during pregnancy </plain></SENT>
