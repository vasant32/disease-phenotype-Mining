<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using the apparent diffusion coefficient (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>), we studied 18 consecutive patients with brain-stem <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> who underwent DWI during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We calculated and compared the <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> ratio (lesion <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>/contralateral <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>) in 10 patients with brain-stem and 23 with supratentorial cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> examined within 24 h of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
