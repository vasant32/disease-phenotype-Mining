<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>From 1944 to 1978 we have operated on 614 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 51 % of these cases the malformation concerned the popliteal vein, in 16 % it concerned the superficial femoral vein, and in 25 % both veins were affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We had only 3 % of iliac malformations and 1 % of inferior vena caval malformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the popliteal vein, ageneses and atresias were of equal incidence, but compressions by fibrous bands were much more frequent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the femoral vein, compressions were most frequent, followed by atresias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ageneses were very rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the iliac vein, atresias were twice as common as ageneses, whereas with the inferior vena cava we only found ageneses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The obstruction to the deep veins can be sectioned but one must also free the supplying vessels </plain></SENT>
