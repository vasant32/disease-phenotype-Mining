<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Venous angiomata, or venous malformations, are often present at birth, although they may not be evident until later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They consist of a spongy tangle of veins, and these lesions usually vary in size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Treatment of venous angiomata is often requested for cosmetic reasons, but painful ulcerations, nerve compression, functional disability can command care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This presentation describes management using sclerosant foam as the treating agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During a 30-month period ending March 2004, 1,321 patients were investigated for venous disorders at the Vein Institute of La Jolla </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fourteen (incidence 1%) were found to have venous angiomata (: nine women) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The age range was 15-76 years (mean 30.8 +/- 18.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Lesions were classified by the Hamburg system and were primarily venous, extratruncular in 12 patients and combined extratruncular and truncular in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eight patients, three males, had manifestations of lower extremity <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022739" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="KTS">Klippel-Trenaunay</z:e> (syndrome; six had only venous <z:mp ids='MP_0002947'>angiomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Only 10 of the 14 patients were treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were studied by Doppler duplex examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Selected lesions were chosen for helical computed tomographic studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance venography was also used to image the lesions, define the deep circulation, note connections with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> circulation, identify vessels for therapeutic access, and determine infiltration of the lesion into adjacent soft tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Foam was produced by the Tessari two syringes one three-way stopcock teclinique, with the air to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46859">Polidocanol</z:chebi> ratio being 4 or 5 to 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This was used at 1% or 2% concentration, specific for each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The SonoSite 190 plus Duplex Doppler was used for ultrasound guidance, whenever deep access was required and to monitor progress and effects of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>A goal was set for each patient before treatment was begun </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Ten patients were treated, and four await treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The mean number of treatments was 3.6 +/- 2.8 (range 1-10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>A primary goal of pain-free healing was set in patients with nonhealing, painful ulceration or symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002619'>varicose veins</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>This was achieved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> treated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Cosmetically, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the patients were improved, and symptomatic patients were relieved of pain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The single complication was formation of a cutaneous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> following injection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001009'>telangiectasias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Sclerosant foam is a satisfactory tool to use in treating venous angiomata including the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022739" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="KTS">Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Use of foam sclerotherapy in this experience has proven the technique to be effective, essentially pain-free, and durable in the short term </plain></SENT>
