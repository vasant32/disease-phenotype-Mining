<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective review was undertaken of 50 consecutive MRI studies ordered for suspected <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accident</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> studies included FLAIR and rapid acquisition with relaxation enhancement (RARE) T2-weighted spin-echo sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The two sequences were compared independently by four observers at two different institutions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Detectability of lesions and image quality were scored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Overall, FLAIR sequences proved superior in 10 patients, detecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> missed with RARE spin-echo technique in five patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In five additional patients, improved characterization of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> infarction and improved detection of microangiopathic deep hemispheric changes were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One brain stem <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> was missed with the FLAIR sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: FLAIR offers advantages in detection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> affecting the cortical ribbon, is a useful, rapid adjunct to conventional T2-weighted spin-echo sequences, and has the potential to replace these in the future </plain></SENT>
