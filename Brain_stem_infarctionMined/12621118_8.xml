<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We therefore hypothesized that abnormal gene expression of fibronectin and other extracellular matrix genes would be found in SWS brain tissue and SWS port-wine skin fibroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fibronectin gene and protein expression from port-wine-derived fibroblasts were compared with that from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> skin-derived fibroblasts of four individuals with SWS using microarrays, reverse transcriptase-PCR, Western analysis, and immunocytochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fibronectin gene and/or protein expression from eight SWS surgical brain samples was compared with that in two surgical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> brain samples and six postmortem brain samples using microarrays, reverse transcriptase-PCR, and Western analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The gene expression of fibronectin was significantly increased (p &lt; 0.05) in the SWS port-wine-derived fibroblasts compared with that of fibroblasts from SWS <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> skin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A trend for increased protein levels of fibronectin in port-wine fibroblasts was found by Western analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No difference in the pattern of fibronectin staining was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The gene expression of fibronectin was significantly increased (p &lt; 0.05), and a trend for increased fibronectin protein expression was found in the SWS surgical brain samples compared with the postmortem controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest a potential role for fibronectin in the pathogenesis of SWS and in the brain's response to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> ischemic injury in SWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The reproducible differences in fibronectin gene expression between the SWS port-wine-derived fibroblasts and the SWS <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> skin-derived fibroblasts are consistent with the presence of a hypothesized <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutation</z:hpo> underlying SWS </plain></SENT>
