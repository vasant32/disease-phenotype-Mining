<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Medulla oblongata, the lowest segment of the brainstem, is a dense anatomic structure with different conglomerate of nuclei, ascending and descending pathways within a very small area and tiny insults can present with expressive clinical manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sensory dysfunction is often a noteworthy element in lateral medullary infarctions and its distribution depends of the site and shape of the lesion within the medulla oblongata </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From etiological point of view the most frequent cause of lateral medullary infarctions is <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> although vertebral dissection has to be carefully ruled out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: A 65 year-old man with a left pain and temperature sensory level up to T4 in a right lateral medullary infarctions due to ipsilateral PICA territory infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Crossed pattern of sensory loss with a sensory level is a quite unusual presentation of lateral medullary infarctions and expresses the involvement of the most external aspect of the spinothalamic tract </plain></SENT>
