<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Liver involvement in hereditary hemorrhagic teleangiectasia is a rare and sometimes severe disease which was unknown and mostly detected at autopsy until a few decades ago </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Typical findings are vascular malformations and connective tissue formation with <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> and atypical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the last years we observed five Osler patients with exclusive or prevailing involvement of the liver </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The present study was undertaken to demonstrate the courses of disease, the techniques of examination and the therapeutical options of this rare manifestation of Osler-disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In every case one could observe hepatic malformations which were established as typical Osler findings with the assistance of histological and above <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> sonographical/color-Doppler-sonographical devices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These special sonographic/color-Doppler-sonographic features make it possible to give up the histological diagnostics or exhaustive investigations by means of angiography, computer-tomography or MRI </plain></SENT>
