<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber disease</z:e>, facial <z:mp ids='MP_0002947'>angioma</z:mp> concerned the whole upper eyelid, extending to the forehead and/or cheek </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Less often, it was localized to the root of the nose; in such cases it was a port-wine, homogeneous <z:mp ids='MP_0002947'>angioma</z:mp>, with clearcut outlines, quite different from the angiomatous dots frequently seen in this area in neonates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Except for these rare cases, <z:mp ids='MP_0002947'>angiomas</z:mp> concerned only half or less of the upper eyelid and no pial <z:mp ids='MP_0002947'>angioma</z:mp> was associated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Finally, congenital capillary naevi with this topography typical of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber disease</z:e> were frequently associated with pial <z:mp ids='MP_0002947'>angioma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
