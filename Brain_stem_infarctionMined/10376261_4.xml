<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Commercially available <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6384">latanoprost</z:chebi> 0.005% was added as a single drop once daily to other antiglaucoma medications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured at 1, 3, and 6 months of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A successful response was defined as a reduction of at least 20% in IOP at the final follow-up evaluation without additional medical or surgical therapy and no adverse events related to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6384">latanoprost</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 18 eyes of 18 patients with SWS and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> were enrolled from 9 clinical centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean baseline IOP was 28.4 +/- 7.1 mmHg (range, 17-42 mmHg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using Kaplan-Meier analysis, a successful response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6384">latanoprost</z:chebi> was observed in 3 of 18 (16.7%) patients at the 6-month interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Seven (38.9%) patients required surgery; three (16.7%) patients required additional medical therapy, seven (38.9%) patients had no change in therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One (5.6%) patient discontinued <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6384">latanoprost</z:chebi> treatment because of intolerable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0155169" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">conjunctival hyperemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two successfully treated patients had significantly greater episcleral vessel engorgement after initiation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6384">latanoprost</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patients with SWS and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> respond poorly to adjunctive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6384">latanoprost</z:chebi> therapy and often require additional medical or surgical intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Increased episcleral vascular engorgement might result in greater operative risks should filtration surgery become necessary in these patients </plain></SENT>
