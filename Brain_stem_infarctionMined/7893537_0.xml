<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patient 1 was a 63-year-old woman who developed an infarction in the red nuclei associated with "top of the basilar" syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two months later, she showed 2-4 c/s rhythmic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001336'>myoclonus</z:hpo> (rubral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001337'>tremor</z:hpo>) involving four extremities </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Rhythmic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001336'>myoclonus</z:hpo> had subsided to some extent after 20 to 24 months </plain></SENT>
