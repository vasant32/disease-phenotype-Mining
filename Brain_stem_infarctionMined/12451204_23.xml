<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the feasibility and usefulness of ictal magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings in the presurgical evaluation of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty patients with frequent or predictable <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> were studied with the intent to capture <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> using a large array single-probe 37-channel or dual-probe 74-channel biomagnetometer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Successful ictal MEG recordings were made in 6 of 20 patients with neocortical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In one other patient, a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> was captured but movement artifact made MEG recordings impossible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As determined by invasive EEG recording and postsurgical outcome, ictal MEG provided localizing information that was superior to interictal MEG in three of the six patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Localization of ictal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> by MEG was at least equivalent to invasive EEG in five of the six patients, and was superior in two patients as determined by postsurgical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Larger studies are necessary to confirm that ictal MEG recordings in patients with frequent or easily provoked neocortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> can contribute localizing information equivalent or superior to invasive EEG recording </plain></SENT>
