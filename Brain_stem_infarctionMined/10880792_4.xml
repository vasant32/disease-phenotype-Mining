<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Magnetic stimulation of the motor cortex can be used to determine the involvement of the cortex in rhythmic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100022'>movement disorders</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic palatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001337'>tremor</z:hpo> (SPT) is thought to come from a pacemaker that is relatively resistant to internal and external stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the effect of magnetic stimulation of motor cortex on SPT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Five male patients, aged 67-79 years, with SPT after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain stem infarction</z:e> or <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had a synchronous mouth angle twitch with the palatal movement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Electromyographic activity was recorded with a monopolar needle electrode from orbicularis oris </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In experiment 1, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was delivered at 200% motor threshold (MT) to reset SPT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In experiment 2, the effect of TMS intensities was studied at 80-240% MT in two SPT patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To determine the influence of the TMS, we used the resetting index (RI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: TMS reset the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001337'>tremor</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 5 SPT patients at 200% MT with RIs of 0.86-0.96 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The latency of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001337'>tremor</z:hpo> reappearance after TMS was longer than the pre-stimulus <z:hpo ids='HP_0001337'>tremor</z:hpo> interval, and the intervals between the subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001337'>tremor</z:hpo> bursts were also prolonged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001337'>tremor</z:hpo> resetting was closely correlated with the magnetic stimulus intensity and the latency of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001337'>tremor</z:hpo> reappearance after TMS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Stimulation of the motor cortex may modulate the generator of SPT </plain></SENT>
