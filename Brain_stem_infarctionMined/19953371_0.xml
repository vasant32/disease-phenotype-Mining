<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: Intracranial VA dissections are reported to cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain stem infarction</z:e>, and SAH with an associated high morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to clarify both the clinical characteristics and effectual treatment of intracranial VA dissections, and to present a retrospective analysis of our experience in the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHOD: Between 1995 and 2007 we experienced 62 VA dissections in our institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fourteen of 62 (23%) cases of VA dissections were associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, and received surgical treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five of fourteen cases presented with SAH, 8/14 cases with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, 1/14 cases with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the hemorrhagic group, internal trapping of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> (ITA) was successfully performed in four cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In one case, bypass surgery was followed by ITA, while one case with treatment-related complication was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>But Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) of almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases was severe; 2/5 cases showed good recovery (GR), and 3/5 cases had severe disability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the non-hemorrhagic group, proximal clipping or trapping was performed in 4/9 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Bypass surgery followed by proximal clipping or trapping was performed in 2/9 cases, and ITA in 1/9 case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One case showed treatment-related complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>GOS was GR in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Outcome in the hemorrhagic group was more severe as compared to the non-hemorrhagic group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The surgical strategy should be planned according to the location of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and the origin of PICA </plain></SENT>
