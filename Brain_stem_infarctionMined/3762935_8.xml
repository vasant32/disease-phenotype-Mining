<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Seven had vertebrobasilar <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo>, eight a brainstem <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (severe in two), and two had only carotid symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Brainstem <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> were more frequent with bilateral intracranial occlusion (60%) than with at least one extracranial occlusion (28.6%), but long-term prognosis did not differ in these two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In follow-up, the mortality rate was 4.5% per year, and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate was 1.8% per year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Major functional disability was seen in 16.7% of the survivors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Bilateral distal VA occlusion may sometimes have a better prognosis than previously assumed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings raise doubts about the value of extra-intracranial surgical bypass procedures in patients with these lesions </plain></SENT>
