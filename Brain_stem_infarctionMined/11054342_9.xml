<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective noncomparative case series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: The authors reviewed the medical records of children under the age of 14 years with SWS who underwent two-stage BGI for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> at two tertiary care referral centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Intraoperative and postoperative complications, intraocular pressure (IOP), number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> medications, visual acuity, and further surgical intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ten eyes of nine patients were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ages of the nine patients at time of first stage BGI ranged between 6 weeks and 13 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With average follow-up of 35 months (range, 10-50), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> eyes had adequate IOP control (&lt; or = 21 mmHg) without the need for additional <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Intraocular pressure was reduced from a mean (+/- standard deviation) of 24.8 +/- 6.2 mmHg preoperatively to 16.9 +/- 2.3 mmHg at last follow-up visit (P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The number of medications used for control of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> was reduced from a mean (+/- standard deviation) of 1.8 +/- 1.0 preoperatively to 1.1 +/- 1.4 at last follow-up visit (P = 0.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005163'>One eye</z:mp> had serous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0339434" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">choroidal effusions</z:e> with overlying serous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000541'>retinal detachment</z:hpo> that resolved spontaneously after 7 days with no permanent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0005163'>one eye</z:mp> had low <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0339434" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">choroidal effusion</z:e> that lasted 4 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were no intraoperative or postoperative suprachoroidal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At last follow-up, visual acuity had improved by one or more lines in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients in whom vision was measurable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Two-stage BGI surgery appears to be a safe and effective treatment for refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> in children with SWS </plain></SENT>
