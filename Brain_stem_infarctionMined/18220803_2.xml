<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>From a clinical viewpoint, HHT patients suffer from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000421'>epistaxis</z:hpo>, mucocutaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001009'>telangiectases</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformations</z:hpo> in various organs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mutations in two known genes (ENG and ALK1) account for the majority of HHT patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additional loci are predicted, but the underlying genes are still to be identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, SMAD4 mutations have been reported to cause JP-HHT combined syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both endoglin and ALK-1 bind to various growth factors in the context of the Transforming Growth Factors (TGF)-beta superfamily and their expression is restricted to vascular endothelial cells and very few other cell types, such as activated monocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Endoglin and ALK1 mutations are thought to affect endothelial cell metabolism, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> and vascular remodelling, even if the precise mechanism leading to the HHT lesions is still obscure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Endoglin is also overexpressed in smooth muscle cells of atherosclerotic plaques, suggesting a role for this protein in atherogenesis and plaque progression, as well as in other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Recently, we demonstrated that HHT adult patients display several deficits of both innate and adaptive immune system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Here, we investigated the function of immune cells in HHT pediatric patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our results clearly show that HHT children have a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> functionally immune system, and suggest that HHT patients become immunocompromised host during their lifetime, likely due to a precocious immunosenescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the relationship between immune responsiveness in HHT and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> are discussed </plain></SENT>
