<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To discuss the clinical characteristics and imaging findings so as to improve the understanding of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751572" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vertebrobasilar dolichoectasia</z:e> (VBD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The clinical profiles of 25 VBD patients diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were retrospectively collected during January 2009-January 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Their clinical characteristics and imaging findings were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: (1) Clinical characteristics: Posterior circulation <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (84%) was predominant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Different degrees of dizziness (40%) was the most common clinical manifestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>(2) Imaging analysis: two cases (8%) had a missed diagnosis by head computerized tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The diagnostic accuracy rate of head MRI and MRA was 100% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The degree of bifurcation height or lateral deviation of basal artery was mainly of the 2nd degree according to the Smoke's criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The lateral deviation of basal artery was mostly of a rightward shift (60%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The medulla oblongata was often compressed to deformation (40%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Basal artery calcification (12%) and VBD-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> (4%) were rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>VBD was usually complicated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> plaques of intracranial arteries in posterior circulation (&gt; 40%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>(3) Follow-up results: three cases (12%) suffered serious <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brainstem infarction</z:e> during a follow-up period of 0.5 - 1.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Two (8%) of them were dead </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The degree of bifurcation height or lateral deviation of basal artery was of the 3rd degree in 3 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The clinical manifestations of VBD are multiple </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>But posterior circulation <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> is not rare, especially for the elderly patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Because of a high rate of disability and mortality, early diagnosis is essential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>MRI is of a great value in confirming the diagnosis and evaluating the prognosis </plain></SENT>
