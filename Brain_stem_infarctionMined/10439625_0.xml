<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIM: Thalamic and brainstem <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> are a cause of organic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100786'>hypersomnia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In thalamic lesions it has been attributed to disruption of ascending activating impulses from the brainstem reticular formation and to insufficient spindling and slow-wave production, which depends upon activities of reticular thalamic nucleus and thalamocortical neurons, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Reported <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0851578,C0852564" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">sleep disorders</z:e> in brainstem lesions have occasionally been contradictory and that is because of the presence of nearby structures in the brainstem with different functions in sleep-waking cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study is to present the results of polysomnographic records in patients with thalamic and/or brainstem vascular lesions, and to correlate them with the anatomical structures affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We have performed a polysomnographic study, (8-channel system), in patients with thalamic and/or brainstem <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of them showed alterations of sleep-wake cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neuroimaging studies were carried out in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We report seven patients, 4 males and 3 females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two cases presented thalamic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, in 3 the lesion was located in the brainstem and 2 patients had thalamo-mesencephalic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of them developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0100786'>hypersomnia</z:hpo> with an increase of NREM sleep </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In patients with bilateral mesencephalic lesions we found that REM sleep was diminished as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We have confirmed that lesions affecting thalamus and mesencephalic or pontine tegmental reticular formation are a cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100786'>hypersomnia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The observation that this sleepiness is transient, supports the evidence of an extrathalamic alternative activating route </plain></SENT>
