<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Subsequent autopsy disclosed a brainstem <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> secondary to a primary dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the basilar artery, and a histologic picture of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002383'>encephalitis</z:hpo> in the walls of the lateral and third ventricles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Metrizamide may cause pathologic changes that must be recognized for the correct interpretation by the pathologist of tissue sections previously exposed to metrizamide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present case, the changes were seen 11 days after exposure of the tissue to metrizamide, consonant with the time course of similar changes observed in animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The localization of the cellular infiltrates to the Virchow-Robin spaces corroborates evidence from the literature that metrizamide enters brain parenchyma via these spaces </plain></SENT>
