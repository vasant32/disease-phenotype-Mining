<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Venous drainage is frequently abnormal because of embryonic veins, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_57'>agenesis</z:mpath>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath>, valvular incompetence, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of deep veins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We previously reported on the surgical management of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">KTS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this article, we update our experience </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">KTS</z:e> underwent surgical treatment for VMs between July 1, 1987, and January 1, 2000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This group represented 6.9% of 290 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">KTS</z:e> who were seen at our institution during this 12.5-year study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Surgical indications, venous <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> (determined with duplex scan, contrast phlebography, magnetic resonance imaging or magnetic resonance phlebography), operative procedures, and complications were reviewed, and outcomes were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twelve male and eight female patients (mean age, 23.4 years; range, 7.7-40.6 years) underwent 30 vascular surgical procedures in 21 lower limbs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 20 patients (100%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002619'>varicose veins</z:hpo> or VMs, 13 (65%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001052'>port-wine stains</z:hpo>, and 18 (90%) had limb <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Pain was the most common complaint, which was present in 16 patients (80%), followed by swelling in 15 (75%), <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> in 8 (40%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002638'>superficial thrombophlebitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100658'>cellulitis</z:hpo> in 3 (15%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Imaging confirmed patent deep veins in 18 patients, hypoplastic femoral vein in 1, and entrapped popliteal veins bilaterally in 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Four patients (20%) had large persistent sciatic veins (PSVs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The CEAP clinical classification was C-3 for 17 patients (85%), C-4 for 1 patient (5%), and C-6 for 2 patients (10%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Stripping of large lateral veins, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_625'>avulsion</z:mpath>, and excision of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">varicosities</z:e> or VMs were performed on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> limbs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Three patients required staged resections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The release of entrapped popliteal veins was performed in both limbs of one patient; another underwent a popliteal-saphenous bypass graft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>One patient underwent excision of a PSV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Open and endoscopic perforator vein ligation was performed in one patient each </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Two patients (12%) had <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematomas</z:mp> that required evacuation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>No patients had caval filter placement; none had postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep venous thrombosis</z:hpo> or pulmonary <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up was 63.6 months (range, 0-138 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients reported initial improvement, but some <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">varicosities</z:e> recurred in 10 patients (50%), an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> did not heal in one, and a new <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> developed in one, 8 years after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>Three patients underwent reoperation for recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">varicosities</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Follow-up CEAP scores were C-2 in 10 patients (50%), C-3 in 6 patients (30%), C-4 and C-5 in 1 patient each (5%), and C-6 in 2 patients (10%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Clinical scores improved from 4.3 +/- 2.2 to 3.1 +/- 2.3 </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The management of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">KTS</z:e> continues to be primarily nonoperative, but those patients with patent deep veins can be considered for excision of symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002619'>varicose veins</z:hpo> and VMs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Although the recurrence rate is high, clinical improvement is significant, and reoperations can be performed if needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Occasionally, deep vein reconstruction, excision of PSVs, or subfascial endoscopic perforator surgery is indicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Because <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">KTS</z:e> is rare, patients should receive multidisciplinary care in qualified vascular centers </plain></SENT>
