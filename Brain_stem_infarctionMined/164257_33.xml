<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the patients of Group A with a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221057" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thalamic syndrome</z:e>, the somatosensory cerebral evoked potentials had a reduced voltage and increased latency on the affected side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No significant anomalies were recorded in the patients of Group B with a Wallenberg or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505,C0022739,C0455717" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Weber syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In patients of group C with a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023944" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">locked-in syndrome</z:e>, the cerebral evoked potentials presented marked bilateral anomalies which provided interesting data about the extension of the pontine vascular lesions into the tegmentum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The pathophysiological mechanisms involved in the changes of average cerebral evoked potentials and in the slowing of corticipetal conduction are discussed </plain></SENT>
