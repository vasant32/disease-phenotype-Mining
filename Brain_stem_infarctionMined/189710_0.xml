<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>1) The Klippel or Venous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>Dysplasia</z:mpath> Group (n = 8) demonstrated: cutaneous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027960" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">nevi</z:e> of metameric distribution, congenital <z:mpath ids='MPATH_99'>varices</z:mpath> (many of which were anomalous by phlebography), <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> of bone and other tissues, but no evidence of arterial involvement by arteriography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>2) Congenital Arterio-Venous Fistulae Group (n = 7) showed: cutaneous angiomata, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> of bone and soft tissues, but arteriographic findings of single or multiple arterio-venous fistulae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>3) Scattered Angiomata Group (n = 4) had single or multiple angiomata involving the lower limb in particular </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Arteriography was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, while phlbography revealed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002624'>venous abnormalities</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Lymphography was performed on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Six of 8 of the Klippel group demonstrated aplastic or hypoplastic lymphatics by lymphography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By contrast, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 7 of the patients in the Congenital Arterio-Venous Fistulae Group showed in their lymphographic findings-three of 4 of these patients had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fourteen of the 19 patients complained of painful swelling as a major symptom </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Lymphatic fistulae and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024248" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lymphoceles</z:e> developed in several patients.Four patients underwent reduction operations for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001004'>lymphedema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Lymphatic abnormalities as demonstrated by lymphography play a significant role in mixed vascular deformities of the lower extremities </plain></SENT>
