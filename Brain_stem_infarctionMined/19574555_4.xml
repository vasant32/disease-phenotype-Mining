<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, long-term outcome has not been systematically analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this monocentric retrospective study we analyzed mortality, long-term functional outcome, and quality of life of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> consecutive patients that were treated by SDC for malignant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0236073" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebellar infarction</z:e> in our institution between 1995 and 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 57 patients were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of them were treated by bilateral SDC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An external ventricular drainage was inserted in 82%, necrotic tissue was evacuated in 56% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no fatal procedural complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Five patients were lost for follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the remaining 52 patients, the mean follow-up interval was 4.7 years (1 to 11 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Within the first 6 months after surgery 16 of 57 patients (28%) had died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At follow-up, 21 of 52 patients (40%) had died and 4 patients (8%) lived with major disability (mRS 4 or 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one patients (40%) lived functionally independent (mRS 0 to 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The presence of additional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain stem infarction</z:e> was associated with poor outcome (mRS &gt; or =4; hazard ratio: 9.1; P=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Quality of life in survivors was moderately lower than in healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: SDC is a safe procedure in patients with malignant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0236073" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebellar infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath>- but not procedure-related early mortality is substantial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Long-term outcome in survivors is acceptable, particularly in the absence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain stem infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
