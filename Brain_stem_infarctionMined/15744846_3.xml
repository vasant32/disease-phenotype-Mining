<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Venous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_107'>congestion</z:mpath> of the brain stem due to dural <z:hpo ids='HP_0004947'>arteriovenous fistulas</z:hpo> (DAVFs) in the cavernous sinus is rare and presents therapeutic challenges </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To assess the prognosis of patients with symptomatic DAVFs and brain stem dysfunction, we evaluated the degree of venous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> by examining pre- and post-treatment magnetic resonance images (MRI) in 2 patients presenting with venous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_107'>congestion</z:mpath> of the brain stem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A 56-year-old woman with left <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> and a 70-year-old woman with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001288'>gait disturbance</z:hpo> attributable to right cavernous sinus DAVFs were referred to our hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In both cases, T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) disclosed a hyperintensity lesion in the brainstem due to venous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_107'>congestion</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: Both patients underwent open surgery for direct embolization of the cavernous sinus because there were no approach routes for transvenous embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patient whose pretreatment MRI demonstrated Gd enhancement continued to manifest neurological deficits and persistence of the abnormal hyperintensity on post-treatment T2-weighted MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the other patient whose pretreatment MRI showed no Gd enhancement, treatment produced a complete response of her neurological deficit and disappearance of the abnormal hyperintensity area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We tentatively conclude that lesions corresponding to hyperintensity areas on non-Gd-enhanced, T2-weighted MRI may reflect a reversible condition whereas lesions identified as hyperintense areas on GD-enhanced T2-weighted MRI may be indicative of irreversibility </plain></SENT>
