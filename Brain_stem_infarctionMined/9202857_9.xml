<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We divided eight patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome</z:e> into two groups, depending on the presence or absence of clinical progression, and investigated differences in brain hemodynamics between the groups by measuring regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) before and after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> activation using stable <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi> computed tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The most evident difference between the groups was <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> vaso-reactivity (delta CBF) in the primarily healthy area remote from lesion. delta CBF on the contralateral side and in distant areas on the affected side was significantly lower in the group with progression group (unpaired t-test), although both groups had similar delta CBF values in the area of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1402294" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary lesion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This remote hemodynamic compromise might aggravate the clinical condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Operations were performed on three patients with progressive disease, resulting in good <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> control with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">anticonvulsants</z:chebi> and a variable degree of improvement in neurological symptoms and vasoreactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The neurological improvement appeared to correlate with the size of the resected area and the increase in delta CBF after surgery </plain></SENT>
