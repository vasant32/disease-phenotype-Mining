<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A series of patients with congenital blood and lymph anomalies of the lower limb investigated and treated at St Thomas's Hospital, London, are reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They fell into three classes: (1) those in which the venous element predominated (Klippel and other syndromes), (2) those with arteriovenous shunts and (3) those with <z:mp ids='MP_0002947'>angiomas</z:mp> of blood or lymph vessels scattered through the limb (diffuse mixed <z:mp ids='MP_0002947'>angiomas</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Most of the patients were investigated by angiography (of blood or lymph systems) as well as by plethysmography, dermal temperature measurements and other techniques in the thermal laboratory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Phlebography showed most abnormalities in the Klippel group and was useful in delineating them before operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The importance of confirming the existence of an adequate deep venous circulation prior to ablation of abnormal superficial vessels is emphasized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Arteriography showed most abnormalities in the group with suspected arteriovenous shunts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most commonly performed operations in this group were for control of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> of the limb or for ulceration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Lymphography showed many of the Klippel group to suffer from insufficiency of the main pathways, either <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition many had vesicles, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistulas</z:mpath> and lymph <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cysts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients in the arteriovenous shunt group had large hyperplastic lymph pathways, which were possibly either congenital or a hypertrophic response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One hundred and thirty-eight operations were performed in 46 patients for a variety of lesions and disabilities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These are reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The scope and benefit of surgery in these children are greater than has been accepted in the past </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Three patients required <z:mpath ids='MPATH_686'>amputation</z:mpath> of a limb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>There were 5 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in the series, 4 of these being in the scattered <z:mp ids='MP_0002947'>angioma</z:mp> group and in patients in whom the deformities extended beyond the limb into the trunk </plain></SENT>
