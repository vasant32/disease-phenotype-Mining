<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of 648 patients who had not undergone prior intracranial procedures for <z:hpo ids='HP_0010828'>hemifacial spasm</z:hpo>, 65% were women; their mean age was 52 years, and the mean preoperative duration of symptoms was 7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms was typical in 92% and atypical in 8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An additional 57 patients who had undergone prior microvascular decompression elsewhere were analyzed as a separate group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were followed prospectively with annual questionnaires </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier methods showed that among patients without prior microvascular decompression elsewhere, 84% had excellent results and 7% had partial success 10 years postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subgroup analyses (Cox proportional hazards model) showed that men had better results than women, and patients with typical <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms had better results than those with atypical <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nearly <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> failures occurred within 24 months of operation; 9% of patients underwent reoperation for recurrent symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Second microvascular decompression procedures were less successful, whether the first procedure was performed at Presbyterian-University Hospital or elsewhere, unless the procedure was performed within 30 days after the first microvascular decompression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patient age, side and preoperative duration of symptoms, history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010628'>Bell's palsy</z:hpo>, preoperative presence of facial <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> or synkinesis, and implant material used had no influence on postoperative results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Complications after the first microvascular decompression for <z:hpo ids='HP_0010828'>hemifacial spasm</z:hpo> included ipsilateral deaf ear in 2.6% and ipsilateral permanent, severe facial <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> in 0.9% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Complications were more frequent in reoperated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, one operative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (0.1%) and two <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brainstem infarctions</z:e> (0.3%) occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Microvascular decompression is a safe and definitive treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0010828'>hemifacial spasm</z:hpo> with proven long-term efficacy </plain></SENT>
