<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to standardize the corneal reflex elicited by air puff to cornea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors studied the corneal reflex with air puff and direct touch by using a standardized method in patients with thalamic <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> (n = 15), hemispheric infarction (n = 9), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brainstem infarction</z:e> (n = 9), multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> (n = 12), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0010628'>Bell's palsy</z:hpo> (n = 12) and in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control subjects (n = 21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The conventional blink reflex (BR) was also studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The reflex responses were recorded from both orbicularis oculi muscles by air puff and direct touch to cornea in addition to the electrical stimulation of the supraorbital nerve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No statistical difference could be detected between the responses elicited by air puff or direct touch to cornea (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Corneal reflex responses were statistically different from the R2 response of the BR (P &lt; 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Because the responses elicited by direct touch and air puff to cornea are identical, air puff to cornea can be used confidently to study the corneal reflex </plain></SENT>
