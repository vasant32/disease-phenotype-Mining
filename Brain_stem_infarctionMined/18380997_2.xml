<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The syndrome consists of a classic triad of anesthesia, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003401'>paresthesias</z:hpo>, and secondary persistent or recurrent facial ulcerations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The most common causes include destruction of the trigeminal ganglion, rhizotomy, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We describe a patient who developed the syndrome as a sequel to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brainstem infarction</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0152177" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">trigeminal neuropathy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Whereas a-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30314">lipoic acid</z:chebi> and gabapentin were ineffective, a remarkable benefit was achieved by administering carbamazepine (200 mg 3 times a day), which influences both neuropathic and behavioral factors in this rare syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our experience with the presented case, together with the scarce information in the literature, indicates that carbamazepine should be the first treatment option for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1274928" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">trigeminal trophic syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
