<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we describe a detailed analysis of musical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000738'>hallucinations</z:hpo> developing after a probable brainstem <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in an 83 year old musician who was able to describe and notate the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000738'>hallucinations</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0000738'>hallucinations</z:hpo> comprised simple, repetitive melodic and rhythmic motifs that were combined apparently randomly without definite tonality, large-scale structure, or timbre </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This observation is consistent with the proposal that musical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000738'>hallucinations</z:hpo> represent abnormal spontaneous activity in auditory cortical areas beyond the primary auditory cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This activity may generate novel musical motifs </plain></SENT>
