<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This report describes SEMG characteristics associated with swallow attempts in 6 dysphagic patients who had suffered brainstem <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> compared with 6 age and gender-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Results indicated that patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> secondary to brainstem <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> differed in both amplitude and timing aspects of swallowing attempts from asymptomatic controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Specifically, the results indicated that during swallow attempts, dysphagic patients produced more muscle activity over a shorter duration and with less coordination than controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Potential physiological mechanisms of these results are discussed </plain></SENT>
