<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This would explain his <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> respiratory complaints, recurrent episodes of <z:mp ids='MP_0001182'>pulmonary hemorrhage</z:mp>, and his <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, at age 44 years, of probable <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
