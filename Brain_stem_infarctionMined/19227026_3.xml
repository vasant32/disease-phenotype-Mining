<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Vestibular Evoked Myogenic Potentials (VEMPs) are saccular responses to acoustic stimuli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They can be recorded from the sternocleidomastoid muscle ipsilaterally to the stimulated ear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Their reflex arc includes the ipsilateral vestibular nuclei </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the usefulness of VEMPs in localising brainstem lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used VEMPs, Blink Reflex (BR) and Brainstem Auditory Evoked Responses (BAERs) to evaluate six patients presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischaemic or haemorrhagic brainstem lesions, or basilar dolichoectasia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: MRI in patient one revealed a dorsolateral medullary <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> on the right </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>VEMP amplitude was reduced ipsilaterally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The R2 BR component was delayed bilaterally upon stimulation of the affected side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients two and three had suffered a left lateral lower pontine <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and a right lateral lower pontine haemorrhage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In patients four and five, MRA revealed dolichoectasia of the basilar artery exerting pressure on the lower lateral pons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>VEMP amplitude was reduced ipsilaterally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patient six had an ischaemic lesion in the right upper lateral pons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The R1, R2i and R2c BR components were delayed ipsilaterally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>BAERs waves IV and V were absent on the right </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>VEMPs were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: VEMPs are affected by lesions of the lateral lower pons and upper medulla </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that they may be a useful addition in the localisation of such lesions </plain></SENT>
