<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventeen patients with a recent focal pontine <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> underwent 3 DTIs at week 1 (W1), week 4 (W4), and week 12 (W12) after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seventeen age-matched and gender-matched controls underwent DTI one time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy (FA) were measured in the basis pontis and bilateral middle cerebellar peduncles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neurological deficit, motor deficit, functional independence, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002070'>limbs ataxia</z:hpo> were assessed with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale, Fugl-Meyer scale, Barthel Index, and the second part of International Cooperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>Ataxia</z:hpo> Rating Scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: FA values at the bilateral middle cerebellar peduncles decreased significantly from W1 to W12 progressively (P&lt;.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patients improved on the NIH <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale, Fugl-Meyer scale, and Barthel Index over time (P&lt;.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Greater absolute value of percentage reduction of FA at the bilateral middle peduncles, however, was associated with the less absolute value of percentage reduction of the NIH <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale and less increase in the Fugl-Meyer scale, as well as greater <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Wallerian degeneration in the middle cerebellar peduncle revealed by DTI may hinder the process of neurological recovery following a focal pontine <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
