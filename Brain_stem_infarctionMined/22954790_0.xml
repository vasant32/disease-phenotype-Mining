<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Their inactivation produces <z:hpo ids='HP_0010545'>downbeat nystagmus</z:hpo>, which resembles eye <z:hpo ids='HP_0100022'>movement disorders</z:hpo> resulting from lesions of the cerebellar flocculus in animal experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, paramedian tract cells are assumed to fulfill an important function in ocular movement control, such as gaze-holding and maintaining vestibular balance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This paper presents a 50-year-old female who manifested <z:hpo ids='HP_0010545'>downbeat nystagmus</z:hpo> due to damage to the paramedian tract cells caused by a localized ischemic lesion in the medulla oblongata </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that a paramedian medullary lesion-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000639'>nystagmus</z:hpo>, similar to that observed following floccular lesions, clearly indicates that a subgroup of paramedian tract cells projecting to the flocculus was impaired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This finding has important implications in considering a brainstem-cerebellar feedback loop involved in vestibulo-oculomotor controls, such as vestibular balance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although there have been a few reports of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010545'>downbeat nystagmus</z:hpo> caused by lesions in the midline region of the lower brainstem, to our knowledge none report the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000639'>nystagmus</z:hpo> due to a strictly localized medullar lesion, such as the one described here </plain></SENT>
