<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Evaluation of the feasibility as well as the success and complication rates of a change of access direction in patients with PAOD for bilateral intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Over the course of one year, 239 patients referred to our department for intervention of the iliac and femorocrural vessels were evaluated for an ipsilateral change of access direction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 38 patients (16%), the symptoms indicated a bilateral femorocrural intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three patients (8%) had to be excluded due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003259'>elevated creatinine</z:hpo> level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the remaining 35 patients, an attempt was made to change the cross-over access to an antegrade access in the same session </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The procedure was accomplished by drawing a sidewinder catheter in the ipsilateral CIA, pushing a hydrophilic guide wire into the SFA and repositioning the sheath </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sonographic and clinical controls followed the next day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 32 patients (91%), the procedure was successful, and in 3 cases (9%), it failed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One major <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> (3%), which could be treated conservatively, occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 2 cases (6%) pseudoaneurysms developed and were treated by compression or thrombin injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>3 minor <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematomas</z:mp> (9%) were documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In one patient (3%) a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> occurred during the intervention after a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain stem infarction</z:e> some weeks before, which could not be related to the intervention (total rate of minor complications 9%, major complications 12%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The bilateral intervention of femorocrural vessels in one session by changing the access direction ipsilaterally is feasible and associated with acceptable complication rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It offers the opportunity to optimize endovascular therapy economically </plain></SENT>
