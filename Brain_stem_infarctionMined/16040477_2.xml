<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A retrospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS: Forty-seven consecutive patients, 28 with recurrent cortical/subcortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and 19 with first-time brainstem <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, referred for dysphagic evaluation to the rehabilitation department of a medical centre </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-five male and 12 female patients with a mean age of 62.0+/-11.5 years were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> duration was 17.0 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The records of clinical examination and a videofluoroscopic study of swallowing were collected through chart review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The percentages of abnormalities seen at clinical examination and videofluoroscopic swallowing study between recurrent cortical/subcortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and first-time brainstem <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients were compared using a chi-square test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The recurrent cortical/subcortical patients suffered from a higher rate of impaired tongue movement, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002307'>drooling</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> at clinical examination and a higher percentage of swallowing abnormalities in oral-preparatory and oral phases in the videofluoroscopic swallowing study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The abnormal videofluoroscopic findings in first-time brainstem <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients predominantly occurred in the pharyngeal phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both groups had more <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0011168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">difficulties swallowing</z:e> thin <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32594,32595">barium</z:chebi> than they did swallowing the thick and paste <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32594,32595">barium</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The recurrent cortical/subcortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and first-time brainstem <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients show different manifestations in some parameters of both clinical examination and videofluoroscopic swallowing study </plain></SENT>
