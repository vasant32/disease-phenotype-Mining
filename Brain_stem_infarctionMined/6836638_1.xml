<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis and control examinations of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were performed by ophthalmoscopy, fluorescence angiography, and ultrasonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ten eyes (nine patients, three out of them with Sturge-Weber's disease) were treated between 1967 and 1982 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A first group (five eyes, five patients) treated until 1974 received a target volume dose of 1,65 to 6,5 Gy combined with subsequent photocoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> these eyes could be preserved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, the second group (five eyes, four patients) treated since 1975 with unique radiotherapy showed better results with respect to visual acuity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The average follow-up period was four years (seven months up to nine years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Late effects were not observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Even in case of advanced disease with <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> ablation and secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo>, an inactivation of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001028'>hemangioma</z:hpo> of the choroid and a simultaneous regression of the secondary alterations could be achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>According to our experiences, enucleations can be prevented by an irradiation with a target volume dose of 20 to 30 Gy </plain></SENT>
