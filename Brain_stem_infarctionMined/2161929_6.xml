<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Her symptoms, including febrile attacks, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002829'>arthralgia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo>, and neurological signs, were characteristic of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002986" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Fabry's disease</z:e> hemizygotes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The neurological findings were compatible with a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain stem infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis was confirmed by the finding of low activities of alpha-galactosidase A (alpha-galA) in plasma, lymphocytes, and cultured fibroblasts, and by the observation of typical lamellar inclusions in the lysosomes of cultured fibroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Increased levels of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="17761">ceramide</z:chebi> trihexoside were also found by TLC of urine sediment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The family history gave no indication of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002986" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Fabry's disease</z:e> in the patient's relatives, and biochemical and ultrastructural investigations of their cells were also <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our findings therefore suggest that the defective gene in the heterozygote has resulted from a new mutation </plain></SENT>
