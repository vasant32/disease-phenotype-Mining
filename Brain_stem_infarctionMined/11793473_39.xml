<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report here a genetic epidemiologic study in a county, A, in the Akita prefecture (population 1.2 million) located in northern Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nine HHT patients who had been referred to tertiary-care hospitals were located in and near the study county </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 137 pedigree members were traced of which 81 were alive and 32 were affected by HHT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Complications associated with cerebral or <z:hpo ids='HP_0006548'>pulmonary arteriovenous malformations</z:hpo> were proven in six out of seven families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Linkage analysis in two large families revealed a weak yet suggestive linkage to the HHT1 locus (encoding endoglin; ENG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three novel mutations were found in four families, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of which led to a frameshift: a G to C transversion at the splicing donor site of intron 3 (Inv3+1 G&gt;C) in one family, one base pair insertion (A) at nucleotide 828 (exon 7) of the endoglin cDNA in two large families (c.828-829 ins A), and a four base pair deletion (AAAG) beginning with nucleotide 1120 (exon 8) of the endoglin cDNA (c.1120-1123 delAAAG) in one family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The insertion of A in exon 11 (c.1470-1471 insA) mutation found in one family has also been reported in a European family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No endoglin gene mutations were found in two families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The population prevalence of HHT in the county was estimated to be 1:8,000 approximately 1:5,000, roughly comparable with those reported in European and U.S. populations, which is contradictory to the traditional view that HHT is rare among Asians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We recommend that families with HHT be screened for gene mutations in order that high-risk individuals receive early diagnosis and treatment initiation that will substantially alter their clinical course and prognosis </plain></SENT>
