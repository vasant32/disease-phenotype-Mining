<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The lack of highly recurrent mutations, locus <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo>, and the presence of mutations in almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> coding exons of the two genes makes the screening for mutations time-consuming and costly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we developed a DHPLC-based protocol for mutation detection in ALK1 and ENG genes through retrospective analysis of known sequence variants, 20 causative mutations and 11 polymorphisms, and a prospective analysis on 47 probands with unknown mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Overall DHPLC analysis identified the causative mutation in 61 out 66 DNA samples (92.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found 31 different mutations in the ALK1 gene, of which 15 are novel, and 20, of which 12 are novel, in the ENG gene, thus providing for the first time the mutational spectrum in a cohort of Italian HHT patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, we characterized the splicing pattern of ALK1 gene in lymphoblastoid cells, both in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls and in two individuals carrying a mutation in the non-invariant -3 position of the acceptor splice site upstream exon 6 (c.626-3C&gt;G) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Functional essay demonstrated the existence, also in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals, of a small proportion of ALK1 alternative splicing, due to exon 5 skipping, and the presence of further aberrant splicing isoforms in the individuals carrying the c.626-3C&gt;G mutation </plain></SENT>
