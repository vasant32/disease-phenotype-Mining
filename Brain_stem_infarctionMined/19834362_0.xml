<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This is the first report of a ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> involving a collateral branch to the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) in a patient who had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 56-year-old man initially presented with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> and underwent 2 catheter-based 4-vessel angiograms with negative results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A delayed angiogram 4 weeks later revealed a dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the posterior meningeal artery, a branch of the vertebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: A 3-dimensional reconstruction of the vertebral angiogram showed proximal occlusion of the proximal left PICA and distal filling via a collateral branch from the posterior meningeal artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A far-lateral approach was used for this patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was found along the course of the collateral posterior meningeal artery and was clipped successfully </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>Aneurysms</z:hpo> involving collateral branches of the PICA are rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is important to recognize such collateral flow preoperatively because inadvertent sacrifice of these vessels during a surgical approach could lead to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and neurological deficits of the PICA territory </plain></SENT>
