<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The abnormal lateral venous channel characteristic of this syndrome was examined, together with its deep venous connections and deep venous patency established if present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seventeen patients (18 limbs) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ultrasound demonstrated calf vein patency in 15 out of 17 limbs and deep venous patency from the popliteal vein to the inferior vena cava in 17 out of 17 limbs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ultrasound was also effective in demarcation of the abnormal lateral venous channel, together with its deep connections (13 out of 16 limbs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that ultrasound is superior to the more established venographic techniques in the investigations of patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022739" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="KTS">Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>From this study, the deep venous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> said to occur in the condition would appear to be less common than previously thought </plain></SENT>
