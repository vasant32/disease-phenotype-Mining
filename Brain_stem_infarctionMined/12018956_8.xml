<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber disease</z:e>, motor and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive defects</z:hpo> are supposed to result mostly from severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They might, therefore be partly prevented by prophylactic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">antiepileptic</z:chebi> drug treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This condition constitutes a possible model for the study of prophylactic drug treatment in severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we compared the outcome of patients treated prospectively with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8069">phenobarbitone</z:chebi> before the first <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo>, with those referred following the first <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo>, in order to identify the issues related to the evaluation of prophylactic treatment of severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Motor and cognitive outcome were compared in patients treated prophylactically with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8069">phenobarbitone</z:chebi> (16 cases) and in those treated following the first <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> (21 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Whereas the incidence of motor deficit was similar in both groups (44 vs. 52%), that of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo> was lower in the group treated prophylactically (76.2 vs. 43.7%, P&lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The major methodological issues encountered included the small number of patients identified at birth that could be included in the study, the need for randomization taking into account the size of the <z:mp ids='MP_0002947'>angioma</z:mp>, and the choice of the prophylactic medication, including the occurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> together with the course of motor and cognitive functions among the endpoints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Prophylactic anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> drug treatment is worth considering for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber disease</z:e>, but a randomized prospective study is necessary to determine this </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It should be multicentric, take in account the size of the <z:mp ids='MP_0002947'>angioma</z:mp>, and decide what the most appropriate medication should be </plain></SENT>
