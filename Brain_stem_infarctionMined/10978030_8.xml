<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The potential role of neuroimaging in predicting deterioration has not been systematically studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study we determine the role of neuroimaging in predicting deterioration in CIMASS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS:-We retrospectively reviewed the clinical and neuroimaging features in 90 patients with cerebellar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We selected for detailed analysis CIMASS in 35 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eighteen patients remained stable and 17 deteriorated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of these 17 patients, 8 were treated conservatively and 9 had surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Radiological features indicative of progression were more common in deteriorating patients compared with stable patients: fourth ventricular shift (82.3% versus 50%, P:=0.075, OR=4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>67), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> (76.5% versus 11.1%, P:=0.0001, OR=26), brain stem deformity (47% versus 5.6%, P:=0.0065, OR=15.1), and basal cistern compression (35.3% versus 0%, P:=0.0076, OR=20.91) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Differences in upward displacement of the aqueduct and pontomesencephalic junction from Twining's line, tonsillar descent on sagittal MRI, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes between stable and deteriorating patients were not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>Hydrocephalus</z:hpo>, brain stem deformity, and basal cistern compression may herald deterioration in CIMASS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Admission to a neurological-neurosurgical intensive care unit and consideration of preemptive surgery are warranted in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Vertical displacement of tonsils or aqueduct, demonstrated by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging, did not predict deterioration </plain></SENT>
