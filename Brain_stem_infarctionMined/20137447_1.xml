<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective case series study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The general clinical data and related ocular manifestations in 16 patients (21 eyes) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome</z:e>-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> in our hospital from January 2003 to December 2007 were analyzed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Age of the patients ranged between 1 month to 31 years old, and the median age was 11 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Bilateral facial <z:mp ids='MP_0002947'>angiomas</z:mp> were present in 8 patients, and two of them had extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001028'>hemangioma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eleven cases had unilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> and 3 of them had bilateral facial <z:mp ids='MP_0002947'>angiomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five patients had bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of them had bilateral facial <z:mp ids='MP_0002947'>angiomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Open anterior chamber angle was found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> affected eyes by gonioscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>B-scan ultrasonography was performed in 21 eyes and diffused occupying lesions in the choroid were found in 8 eyes (38.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Posterior bowing of the iris, low echo in ciliary body and shallow ciliary body detachment were found by ultrasound biomicroscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> surgeries including trabeculotomy, trabeculectomy, non-penetrating deep sclerectomy, valve implantation and cyclocryotherapy were performed in 18 eyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Eighty percent of the eyes which underwent trabeculectomy developed choroidal detachment after operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Ten patients (11 eyes) were followed-up for 22 months on average </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Intraocular pressure was significantly lower than that before the operation (t = 5.3956, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Intraocular pressure in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> followed-up eyes was controlled at &lt; or = 21 mm Hg (1 mm Hg = 0.133 kPa) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The clinical features of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome</z:e>-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> include facial <z:mp ids='MP_0002947'>angiomas</z:mp>, open anterior chamber angle and choroidal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001028'>hemangioma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> surgery can reduce the intraocular pressure effectively </plain></SENT>
