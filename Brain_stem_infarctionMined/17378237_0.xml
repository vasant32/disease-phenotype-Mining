<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2972">Baclofen</z:chebi> is frequently used in the management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001257'>spasticity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>When the therapeutic benefit of oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2972">baclofen</z:chebi> is not satisfactory, intrathecal administration should be considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This method reduces side effects due to a reduction in dosage compared to oral administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CASE DESCRIPTION: This study presents a 52-year-old man with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002445'>tetraplegia</z:hpo> after a brainstem <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four days after the placement of a Synchromed II infusion pump (100 mcg per day), the patient presented a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002590'>paralytic ileus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The treatment was conservative and the dosage of intrathecal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2972">baclofen</z:chebi> was reduced to lowest drug flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After 15 days of treatment the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002595'>ileus</z:hpo> was resolved and the dosage progressively increased without incident </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002595'>Ileus</z:hpo> should be considered as a rare side effect after intrathecal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2972">baclofen</z:chebi> administration, especially in cases of brainstem injury because <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2972">baclofen</z:chebi> seems to act directly over vegetative brainstem nuclei </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Based on this case, it is strongly recommended to decrease the dose of intrathecal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2972">baclofen</z:chebi> as one of the main therapeutic options </plain></SENT>
