<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Vascular lesions are common in infants and children and can be grouped into two main classifications: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282607" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">vascular tumors</z:e> and vascular malformations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001028'>Hemangiomas</z:hpo> are proliferative lesions characterized by increased endothelial cell turnover </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Vascular malformations are congenital abnormalities involving capillaries, veins and/or lymphatics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A multidisciplinary approach regarding diagnosis and treatment of vascular anomalies in children is crucial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Several options are available for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001028'>hemangiomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Since January 2003, 14 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001028'>hemangioma</z:hpo> located in the cervicofacial region were treated at "La Sapienza" University </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seven patients underwent surgical resection, using Varioscope, and seven laser therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The Varioscope is an operating microscope, which is mounted on the head </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Specific advantages convinced the authors to use the Varioscope initially </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Autofocus, a magnification range between 3.6-7.2X and automatic parallax control allow unlimited freedom of movement which alleviates the discomfort of keeping the same distance for a long time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Laser therapy can selectively destroy specific targets within the skin by using an appropriate wavelength and pulse duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Laser treatment parameters are based on several factors, including lesion location, lesion <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, and patient skin type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The purpose of our study was aesthetic and functional improvement in patients comparing surgical and laser therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We obtained an aesthetic improvement in 11 patients and local pain control in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the cosmetic results was subjective but <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> parents indicated satisfaction with their decision regarding their child's treatment </plain></SENT>
