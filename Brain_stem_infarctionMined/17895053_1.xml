<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance brain scanning showed four pontine <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and one midbrain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> without accompanying diencephalic or cerebral convexity lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Frontal (n=5) and parietal (n=5) hypoperfusion was detected by SPECT scanning and comparison in terms of mean counts made to five age-matched controls with a significant P value of .01 and .02, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neuro-psychological testing showed a frontal system syndrome in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> five patients and parietal lobe signs in two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Excellent medical recovery ensued in four of the five patients and a moderately good recovery in one as judged by the Canadian Neurological Scale, Barthel Index, and Rankin Scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The three relatively young patients in this series were unable to resume their former employment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This was attributed to a significant frontal system syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Brainstem <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> may cause significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> best delineated by formal neuropsychological evaluation, and SPECT scanning may be more sensitive than structural neuroimaging techniques in this setting </plain></SENT>
