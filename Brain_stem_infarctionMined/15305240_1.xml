<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As a result, different clinical syndromes are designated with the same eponym, other crossed syndromes are nearly completely forgotten </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, the original historical publications on the classical alternating pontine syndromes of Foville, Millard-Gubler, Raymond, Raymond-Cestan, Brissaud-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270885" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sicard</z:e>, Gasperini, Grenet and Gelle were reviewed and critically analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Their anatomic basis and etiology, and the main publications about each syndrome were discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the syndromes of Foville, Millard-Gubler, Raymond, Raymond-Cestan and Brissaud-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270885" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sicard</z:e> are interpreted in their essential parts concurring to their historical descriptions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Crossed syndromes of Foville and Millard-Gubler are occasionally mixed up with each other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The syndromes in the last decades described as crossed syndromes of Gasperini and Grenet were, however, never described by Gasperini and Grenet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The existence of the Gelle's as "paralysie altern√© de l'acoustique" postulated syndrome seems to be very questionable </plain></SENT>
