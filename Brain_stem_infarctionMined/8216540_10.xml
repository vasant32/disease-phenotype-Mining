<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001052'>nevus flammeus</z:hpo> was unilateral in 27 patients (twice as often on left side) and bilateral in 13 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Only 3 of these 13 patients had bilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral lesions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>Seizures</z:hpo>, most of which were focal, were present in 32 patients (80%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The percentage of patients in whom the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> subsequently became generalized was very high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>Seizure</z:hpo> presentation coincided with febrile episodes in 10 of 32 patients (31%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Total <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> control was obtained in 15 patients (47%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Abnormality of the cerebral parenchyma can be detected from birth in some patients and has a progressive character; at the same time, progressive <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> and parenchymatous hyperdensity of the affected hemisphere is evident, as well as a decrease in arterial size, especially during the first decade of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No relationship exists between the size of the facial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001052'>nevus flammeus</z:hpo> or its unilateral or bilateral location and clinical neurologic impairment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conversely, a direct relationship exists between greater anatomic manifestations (i.e., <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath>, calcification) in the involved hemisphere when the lesion is unilateral as well as the presence of leptomeningeal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002992,C1411989" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">angiomatosis</z:e> in both cerebral hemispheres in patients with bilateral facial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001052'>nevus flammeus</z:hpo> and the severity of clinical disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>Mental retardation</z:hpo> was present in 60% of patients and was severe in 32.5% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Even though computed tomography and T1- and T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging have great diagnostic value, magnetic resonance imaging enhanced with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35739">DTPA</z:chebi> discloses the cerebral, leptomeningeal, and ocular lesions before the first evidence of neurologic abnormality.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
