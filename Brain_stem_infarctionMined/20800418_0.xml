<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Few previous studies have focused on the involvement of the lymphatic system in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022739" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="KTS">Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome (KTS)</z:e>, although some evidence suggests that lymphatic abnormalities are associated with the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to investigate the involvement of the lymphatic system in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">KTS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Magnetic resonance lymphangiography (MRL) with the use of gadobenate dimeglumine as the contrast was performed on 32 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">KTS</z:e> involving the extremities to evaluate lymphatic vessels, lymph nodes, and veins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-one of 32 patients exhibited lymphatic vessel and/or lymph node anomalies, including <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> (11/31), <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> (20/31) of lymphatic vessels, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001004'>lymphedema</z:hpo> (31/31) of the affected limbs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two patients showed asymmetry of the inguinal nodes exhibiting either the absence, or an increase or a decrease in number and size of the inguinal nodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Venous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> was found in 31 patients in superficial and/or deep veins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results showed a high concomitance of malformations of the lymphatic system and veins in the affected limbs of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">KTS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Lymphatic system abnormalities as examined with MRL are commonly associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">KTS</z:e> and are likely to play a significant role in the disorder </plain></SENT>
