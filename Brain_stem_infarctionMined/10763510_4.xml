<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Using the previously reported method of experimental localized brainstem <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in dogs, we designed this study to elucidate sequential changes of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in three separate regions of the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system: the cerebral cortex, thalamus, and midbrain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The data obtained were referred to in subsequent investigations of cerebrovascular autoregulation and vasomotor reactivity to <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2 </z:chebi></plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Localized brainstem <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> was produced by permanently occluding the perforators of the posterior cerebral arteries between the bilateral origins of the posterior communicating arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The hydrogen clearance method was applied to measure rCBF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cerebrovascular autoregulation and <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> reactivity were assessed in three regions 1, 3, and 5 h after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">vascular occlusion</z:e>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">Vascular occlusion</z:e> resulted in a decrease of rCBF that was 65% in the midbrain and close to 30%-40% in the thalamus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, no significant change was seen in the cerebral cortex even 5 h after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">vascular occlusion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> impaired autoregulation in the thalamus, while it was preserved in the cerebral cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> did not alter autoregulation in any of the three regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A marked loss of <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> reactivity was observed in the ischemic brainstem, although it was well preserved in the cerebral cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that noradrenergic fibers originating from the cervical sympathetic ganglia play a main role in the cerebrovascular autoregulation in the cerebral cortex, while noradrenergic fibers possibly originating from the autonomic centers in the brainstem are responsible in the thalamus; that the noradrenergic neuron probably is not involved in the maintenance of cerebral blood flow during <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo>; and that the effect of <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> is mediated by its direct effect on the arteriolar wall in the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system </plain></SENT>
