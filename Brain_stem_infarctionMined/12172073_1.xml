<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the case of our patient, the infarction was difficult to diagnose because the patient had atypical features and a past history of head injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, we could diagnose the medial medullary infarction easily using diffusion MRI within several hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Then, a rehabilitation program was started the day after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We believe that diffusion MRI can be used as a useful method for very early stage diagnosis and to execute rehabilitation for early <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
