<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022739" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="KTS">Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome</z:e> is a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1275966" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">congenital vascular disease</z:e> characterized by cutaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001028'>hemangiomas</z:hpo>, venous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">varicosities</z:e>, and limb <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath>; and is associated with both hemorrhagic and thrombotic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The importance of this diagnosis, including the presence of neuraxial vascular anomalies, is often under-appreciated by both obstetric and anesthesia providers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>While regional <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anesthetic</z:chebi> management of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">KTS</z:e> has been discussed by others, we present a case in which regional anesthesia presented an unwarranted risk to the patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL FEATURES: An <z:mp ids='MP_0001261'>obese</z:mp>, 18-yr-old parturient with a fetus in the breech position underwent Cesarean delivery at 35 weeks gestation secondary to evolving <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032914" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PEE|PREG1|PEE1">preeclampsia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, no neurovascular imaging of this patient's spine was available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patient underwent an attempted external cephalic version, a failed obstetric induction, and, ultimately, a Cesarean delivery under general anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The resulting infant was without any stigmata of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">KTS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both mother and infant did well during the course of their hospitalization, and were discharged home without incident </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The posterior cutaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001028'>hemangiomas</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">KTS</z:e> may be associated with underlying epidural and subdural vascular malformations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Disruption of these vascular anomalies during regional anesthesia may lead to neuraxial <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> formation, which may be further compounded by a consumptive <z:hpo ids='HP_0003256'>coagulopathy</z:hpo> observed in some cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">KTS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>If neuraxial vascular anomalies cannot be ruled out radiographically, regional anesthesia should be avoided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Additionally, regardless of the <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anesthetic</z:chebi> technique chosen, the coagulation profile of these patients should be verified for signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003256'>coagulopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
