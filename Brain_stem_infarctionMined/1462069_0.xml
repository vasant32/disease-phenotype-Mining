<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In unilateral internuclear <z:hpo ids='HP_0000602'>ophthalmoplegia</z:hpo>, 38 of 60 patients (63.3%) had masseter reflex abnormalities, two patients (3.3%) showed changes of the blink reflex R1 component, and 13 patients (21.7%) combined alterations of the masseter reflex and the blink reflex R1 component </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>46 (86.8%) of these 53 patients with electrophysiological abnormalities had unilateral changes, which were ipsilateral to the medial longitudinal fasciculus lesion in 42 patients (91.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In bilateral internuclear <z:hpo ids='HP_0000602'>ophthalmoplegia</z:hpo>, 24 of 40 patients (60.0%) had abnormalities of the masseter reflex, two (5.0%) showed changes of the blink reflex R1, and nine (22.5%) combined alterations of the masseter reflex and the blink reflex R1 component </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>20 (57.1%) of these 35 patients with electrophysiological abnormalities had bilateral changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, masseter reflex abnormalities indicating midbrain lesions were seen in 63.3% and 60.0%, respectively, of unilateral and bilateral internuclear <z:hpo ids='HP_0000602'>ophthalmoplegia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Blink reflex R1 component changes with or without impairment of the masseter reflex indicating rostral pontine to midpontine lesions occurred in 25.0% and 27.5%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These figures correspond to the results of postmortem examinations and to theoretical considerations based on the length of the medial longitudinal fasciculus </plain></SENT>
