<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 48-year-old man with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stoke was found to have an unusual combination of three rare mesencephalic syndromes after detailed neuro-ophthalmic evaluation: the plus-minus lid syndrome, the vertical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1282373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">one-and-a-half syndrome</z:e>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Claude's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We discuss the clinical and anatomical localization of these syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This was corroborated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) which revealed areas of infarction at the thalamo-mesencephalic junction and the right rostral midbrain involving the third nerve fascicle and the red nucleus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our case highlights the importance of a careful ocular motility examination as a tool which has a highly localizing value in the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
