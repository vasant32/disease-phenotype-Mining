<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The management of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0236073" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebellar infarctions</z:e> is controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine which patients require surgical treatment and which surgical procedure should be performed when a patient with a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0236073" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebellar infarction</z:e> exhibits progressive neurological deterioration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 44 patients (24 male and 20 female patients; average age, 56 yr) were treated at our institution for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0236073" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebellar infarctions</z:e> in the past 8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five patients received conservative treatment; two patients who were deeply <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009421" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">comatose</z:e> received no treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The remaining 17 patients underwent emergency surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of those 17 patients, 8 underwent external ventricular drainage alone, 5 underwent external ventricular drainage as the first treatment plus secondary suboccipital craniectomy, and 4 underwent suboccipital craniectomy, with removal of necrotic tissue, as the first treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 25 conservatively treated patients, 20 experienced good outcomes, 4 experienced moderate outcomes, and 1 died as a result of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002204'>pulmonary embolism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the 17 surgically treated patients, 10 experienced good functional recoveries (7 treated with external ventricular drainage only and 3 treated with drainage followed by suboccipital craniectomy) and 3 survived with mild neurological deficits (one patient underwent ventriculostomy, one suboccipital craniectomy plus external ventricular drainage, and one suboccipital craniectomy only) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The overall mortality rate was 13.6% (6 of 44 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: For patients with worsening levels of consciousness and radiologically evident ventricular enlargement, we recommend external ventricular drainage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We reserve surgical resection of necrotic tissue for patients whose clinical status worsens despite ventriculostomy, those for whom worsening is accompanied by signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002512'>brainstem compression</z:hpo>, and those with tight posterior fossae </plain></SENT>
