<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study we investigated recovery following <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> and resuscitation in the aged rat brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Male Fischer 344 rats (6, 12 and 24 months old) underwent 7 minute <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> before resuscitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overall survival and hippocampal neuronal counts were determined at 4 days of recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Brainstem function was assessed by hypoxic ventilatory response (HVR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mitochondria of brainstem, cortex and hippocampus were isolated and assessed for respiratory function </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The time course of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> function was established using 3-month old Wistar rats with 12-minute <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
