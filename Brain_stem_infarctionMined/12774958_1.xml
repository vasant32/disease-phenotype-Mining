<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Stereotyped, repeated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> manifesting as pure motor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> are most often attributed to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> of the internal capsule or ventral pons resulting from in situ disease of the small penetrating arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CASE DESCRIPTION: We report a 61-year-old man presenting with recurrent episodes of left-sided <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> consistent with the lacunar syndrome of pure motor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subsequent neuroimaging revealed infarction of the right ventral pons and a critical basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> as the inciting lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Despite maximal antithrombotic therapy, he continued to have repeated symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Angioplasty and stenting were attempted but both failed due to plaque recoil and technical difficulties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After the procedure, the patient had no further ischemic episodes and remained symptom-free at two months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This case illustrates the imprecise and discordant relationship between the mode of presentation of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> syndrome and its presumed pathophysiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The lacunar syndrome of pure motor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> should be recognized by clinicians as a mode of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> presentation due not only to small vessel disease, but also to large artery atherosclerotic disease such as basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Prompt institution of treatment can lead to a good clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
