<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The four cases presented here (ages 8-9, two females) illustrate the broad range of physiologic involvement and associated neuropsychological functioning in SWS, and argue against the idea of a "typical" SWS neuropsychological presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rather, we highlight a preliminary collection of disease status/severity factors thought to impact neuropsychological presentation in SWS, including degree of cortical involvement (unilateral versus bilateral; posterior only versus posterior/anterior), age at time of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, extent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> control, history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002401'>stroke-like episodes</z:hpo>, and magnitude of neurologic decline/deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We discuss the need for broad-based assessment in this medical population, as various impairment combinations (e.g., perceptual, language, executive) create unique presentations as well as the need for individualized intervention </plain></SENT>
