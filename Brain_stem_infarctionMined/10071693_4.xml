<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A diagnosis of BAO due to basilar <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">artery dissection</z:e> (BAD) was suspected at angiography, and this was confirmed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi>-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These investigations clearly showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the typical diagnostic signs such as a pseudolumen, double lumen and intimal flap, and a pseudolumen in resolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The spontaneous healing of the dissection was clearly demonstrated during 10 months of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We stress that BAD can occur in young children and that combined diagnosis with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi>-enhanced MRI and angiography is conclusive for diagnosis of dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Wider use of these combined diagnostic methods will allow the detection of less severe basilar <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">artery dissection</z:e>, thus extending the spectrum of presentation and prognosis </plain></SENT>
