<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 2-Deoxy-2[<z:chebi fb="0" ids="36939">18F</z:chebi>]fluoro-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4167">D-glucose</z:chebi> (FDG) PET was performed in 13 children (age range 0.7 to 15.1 years; five boys, eight girls) with unilateral SWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Based on asymmetries between homologous cortical areas in FDG PET images, cortical areas of mildly (10% to 20% decrease), and severely (&gt;20% decrease) asymmetric cortical metabolism were defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These areas were normalized to the size of the ipsilateral hemisphere and correlated with clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> characteristics, full-scale IQ, and interictal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002353'>EEG abnormalities</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> frequency (p = 0.027) and lifetime number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> (p = 0.017) showed a positive correlation with the area (expressed as the percentage of cortical area of ipsilateral hemisphere) of mildly asymmetric cortical metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with higher IQ had a shorter duration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> (p = 0.044) and a larger area of severely asymmetric cortical metabolism (p = 0.044) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with bilateral interictal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002353'>EEG abnormalities</z:hpo> had larger lifetime number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> (p = 0.042), lower IQ (p = 0.024), and smaller area of severely asymmetric cortical metabolism (p = 0.019) than those with only ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002353'>EEG abnormalities</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Association of severely asymmetric cortical metabolism with relatively preserved cognitive function in SWS suggests that functional reorganization occurs more readily when cortex is severely rather than mildly damaged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the area of mildly asymmetric cortical metabolism may exert a nociferous effect on the remaining of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, the extent and degree of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> asymmetry detected by PET are sensitive markers of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> severity and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> in SWS </plain></SENT>
