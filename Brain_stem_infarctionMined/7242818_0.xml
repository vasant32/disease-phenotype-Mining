<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Initially she showed slight <z:hpo ids='HP_0000711'>restlessness</z:hpo> due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, neck stiffness and subhyaloid <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four-vessel study revealed a basilar <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> on right retrograde brachial angiography and anterior communicating <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> on left carotid angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two weeks after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, when she had no neurological deficit except for intermittent appearance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001289'>disorientation</z:hpo>, both <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were successfully clipped through right pterional approach of Yasargil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> was apparently due to basilar bifurcation <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Postoperatively, she showed right <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> including her face, aniscocoria (left, 4 mm, oval: right, 1.5 mm, round) and conjugate deviation toward the left </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The disturbance of conjugate eye movement and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> completely disappeared in 2 and 7 days respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patient was discharged 4 weeks postoperatively with mild left <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028866" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">3rd nerve palsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At present, one year postoperatively, she is fully engaged in her housewife life without any neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A case of superior <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0455716" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Foville syndrome</z:e> combined with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505,C0022739,C0455717" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Weber syndrome</z:e> after clipping of basilar bifurcation <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was reported and its anatomicoclinical mechanism was reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The pathogenesis was supposed to be left midbrain ischemic lesion due to circulatory disturbance of P-1 perforators (P-1: proximal posterior cerebral artery); e.g., occlusion on clipping of vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This P-1 perforator syndrome after aneurysmal clipping has been reported only little </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The importance of preservation of these perforators with careful dissection and manipulation under microscopy was emphasized </plain></SENT>
