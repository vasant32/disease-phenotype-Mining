<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>But in less dramatic cases, it is often difficult to make accurate clinical diagnosis and to document the precise extent of an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present study is to demonstrate clinicotopographic correlations in patients with various brainstem and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0236073" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebellar infarctions</z:e> and to reevaluate the importance of bedside clinical examinations for understanding pathophysiology and planning management of the patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One hundred forty-three patients with clinical diagnosis of the vertebrobasilar infarction confirmed by MRI were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MRI is superior to CT scanning in delineating areas of infarction in the territory of posterior cerebral circulation because of the three dimensional approach and the lack of bone artifact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MRI also allowed very precise clinicotopographic correlations even in patients with good recovery, in whom pathologic verification of the lesion is not possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There are some restrictions of MRI diagnosis to detect the clinical features which change from hour to hour, because of the mechanical limitation in spatial resolution and of the temporal uncertainty of the lesions such as reversible <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> or coincidental asymptomatic old lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Clinical importance of ocular signs (eg. skew deviation, gaze limitations, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000639'>nystagmus</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000615'>pupillary abnormalities</z:hpo> and so on) was discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Some <z:hpo ids='HP_0000496'>eye-movement abnormalities</z:hpo> (eg. gaze <z:mp ids='MP_0000754'>paresis</z:mp>, MLF syndrome, 'one-and-a-half' syndrome, lateropulsion or contrapulsion of eyes, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0010544'>vertical nystagmus</z:hpo> at the primary position) served as useful localizing signs, and especially their consecutive observations were of importance for clinical local diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Clinical syndromes, caused by lacunar lesions located either in the supratentorial or in the infratentorial structures, such as pure motor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> and ataxic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> were also discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In some cases of these syndromes, MRI failed to document the precise lesion responsible for the episode due to the multiplicities of small asymptomatic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Even in such cases, detailed clinical informations (temporal profiles of the episode, past medical histories, neuro-ophthalmic signs and so on) may enable the differential diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the use of new imaging techniques such as MRI may provide new insights in the diagnosis of cerebrovascular diseases, but the importance of clinical observations can not be overemphasized </plain></SENT>
