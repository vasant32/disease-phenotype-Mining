<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both of them were successfully treated with one-stage reconstruction combined with aorto-carotid-subclavian bypass and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>While it could not be over-emphasized how to protect both myocardium and cerebrum during CABG, cerebral perfusion through the reconstructed carotid bypass graft is the key maneuver during <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> and moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hypoperfused cerebral hemispheres were both improved extensively in the follow-up angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The absence of cerebral deficit and the free from coronary <z:mp ids='MP_0006112'>angina</z:mp> suggested that surgical technique to combine innominate with coronary artery surgery is feasible with acceptable mortality and morbidity rate </plain></SENT>
