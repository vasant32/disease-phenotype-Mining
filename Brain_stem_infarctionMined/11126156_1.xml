<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report on 2 patients who uncommonly developed isolated limb myorhythmia in association with inferior olive <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> (IOH) after an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the brain stem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A slow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001337'>tremor</z:hpo> presented in the proximal upper limbs predominantly when at rest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It was aggravated by outstretched arms and by active hand movements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The surface electromyogram (EMG) recorded simultaneous activities over the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> muscles with a rate of 3.5 Hz and 2.5 Hz in 2 patients respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the first patient, bilateral limb myorhythmia presented 12 months after the brain stem <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and both inferior olives were hypertrophic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the second patient, unilateral limb myorhythmia developed in the left hand 7 months after right pontine <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, and only the right inferior olive was hypertrophic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that limb myorhythmia commencing after brain stem insult is anatomically and temporally related to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> of the contralateral inferior olive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Based on our 2 patients and previously reported cases, we propose that a possible causal relationship exists between limb myorhythmia and contralateral IOH, although its pathophysiological mechanisms remain to be established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We suggest that, similar to <z:hpo ids='HP_0010530'>palatal myoclonus</z:hpo>, isolated limb myorhythmia is within the clinical spectrum of IOH </plain></SENT>
