<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Earlier findings in patients with a small supratentorial white matter <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> demonstrated subtle impairments of cognition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This is in line with reported difficulties in regaining premorbid level of functioning in daily life activities, even though any physical neurological deficits are no longer present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Either a "bystander effect" of adjoining gray matter or a long distance effect through hypometabolism or other neurochemical changes might underlie these impairments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To find the best explanation, a group of 17 patients with a lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in the brainstem was neuropsychologically evaluated and compared with a closely matched control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients demonstrated significantly impaired task performance on a constellation of neuropsychological tasks that was very similar to the findings previously found in patients with a supratentorial lacunar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> (Boston Naming Test, <z:chebi fb="29" ids="28621,35026">TEA</z:chebi> visual elevator, category fluency, Trailmaking Test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that a small white-matter <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> may affect cognitive functioning in a nonspecific way independently of its location </plain></SENT>
