<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The presence of fixed, <z:mp ids='MP_0002546'>dilated pupils</z:mp> after cardiac surgery is an ominous sign, typically indicating severe diffuse <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0752304" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoxic-ischemic brain injury</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rarely, however, this finding can be seen as a result of focal midbrain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is important to differentiate between these syndromes, as the latter might be amenable to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> treatments, and because they affect consciousness very differently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CASE: A 46-year-old man with diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> underwent coronary artery bypass grafting and closure of an incidentally discovered <z:hpo ids='HP_0001655'>patent foramen ovale</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>He underwent neurologic evaluation on post-operative day 6 because he was not speaking and appeared to have a new right <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eye movements, pupillary, and lid function were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> at this time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MRI showed multiple posterior circulation <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, involving both cerebral peduncles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On post-operative day 12, he became unresponsive, quadriplegic, and had bilaterally fixed, <z:mp ids='MP_0002546'>dilated pupils</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CT showed low attenuation in nearly the entirety of both cerebral peduncles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Midbrain infarction is rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Bilateral midbrain infarction is even rarer and typically presents as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023944" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">locked-in syndrome</z:e> with preservation of pupillary function and at least vertical eye movements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In our review of the literature, we found only three other cases of midbrain infarction associated with bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0011499'>mydriasis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>As in our case, these characteristically involved the anteromedial midbrain bilaterally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Fixed, <z:mp ids='MP_0002546'>dilated pupils</z:mp> after cardiac surgery can rarely be caused by bilateral anteromedial midbrain infarctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>It is important to differentiate this from the much more common diffuse hypoxic-ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
