<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The association between congenital vascular malformations and peripheral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> is very rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study reports a case of giant superficial femoral artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> (7-cm-long) associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505,C0022739" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Parkes-Weber syndrome</z:e> (capillary malformation, multiple <z:hpo ids='HP_0004947'>arteriovenous fistulas</z:hpo> [AVFs], skeletal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> of the affected limb) treated by positioning two covered self-expandable endoprostheses after embolization of AVFs with Gianturco coils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The peri- and postoperative course was uneventful and the postprocedural angiography showed the complete exclusion of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> sac </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At last follow-up, after 87 months, the duplex scan and computed tomography scan showed regular patency of the vessels with <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> sac and the presence of a large number of AVFs </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The lack of evidence does not allow the establishment of the most suitable treatment for this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Endovascular approach associated with previous embolization of AVFs may represent a valid alternative to traditional surgical repair, which is still burdened by a high percentage of complications and failures </plain></SENT>
