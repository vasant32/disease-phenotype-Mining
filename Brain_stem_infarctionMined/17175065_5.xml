<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Klippel-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Tr</z:e>Ã©naunay syndrome (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">KTS</z:e>) is a well-known eponym for a capillary-lymphatic-venous malformation which is associated with soft tissue and skeletal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath>, usually of one or more limbs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Plain films, sonograms, conventional venograms, and arteriograms have been employed for the evaluation of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the usefulness of multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) and fast 3-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging (3D-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) venography for the assessment and therapeutic planning of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">KTS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A prospective study in 16 consecutive patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">KTS</z:e> using MDCT and 3D-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venography, performed between January 2004 and January 2006 in a university hospital in Pamplona, Spain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In nearly <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, persistent embryologic veins were observed, and in one subject <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath>/atresia of the whole deep venous system of the affected extremity was seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In four individuals <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> of the femoral vein was observed; one subject had duplication of the femoral vein, and in three patients <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath>/atresia of this vein was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only half of the patients had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> popliteal veins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In one patient, aneurysmal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of the popliteal vein was detected, and in six subjects, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> of this vein was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The presence of geographic stains was suggestive of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> and/or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> of femoral and popliteal veins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: The small size of the group of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">KTS</z:e>, which is related to low incidence of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: MDCT and 3D-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venography are extremely helpful for the global evaluation of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">KTS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Information regarding soft tissue and bony <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> as well as information about superficial and deep venous systems may be obtained with a single exam </plain></SENT>
