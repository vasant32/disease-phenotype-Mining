<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Pulmonary arteriovenous fistulae (PAVF) should be investigated in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000961'>cyanosis</z:hpo> of unknown cause </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This is a case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000961'>cyanosis</z:hpo> in a child submitted to pulmonary lobectomy with PAVF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: Male patient, 3 years old, with history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000961'>cyanosis</z:hpo> without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002094'>dyspnea</z:hpo> since 8 months of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>He presented significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0000961'>cyanosis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100759'>finger clubbing</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> heart auscultation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Chest X-ray showed condensation in the upper half of the left lung </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> echocardiography and ECG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PaO2 = 28 mmHg in room air and PaO2 = 31.5 mmHg with nasal O2 catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pulmonary <z:hpo ids='HP_0004947'>arteriovenous fistula</z:hpo> was diagnosed through magnetic resonance imaging, with no possibility of embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patient was submitted to upper left lobectomy under general anesthesia associated to spinal anesthesia with <z:chebi fb="71" ids="17303">morphine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3215">bupivacaine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Selective tracheal tube for the right lung was inserted for monopulmonary ventilation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>SaO2 was 59% in room air; at operating room admission 69% (FiO2 = 1.0); after general anesthesia induction 65% (FiO2 = 1.0); during monopulmonary ventilation 58% (FiO2 = 1.0), after lobectomy 98% (FiO2 = 1.0) and 98% at the end of the surgery (FiO2 = 0.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Extubation was performed one hour after surgery completion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>As from the fifth postoperative day patient started presenting progressive SpO2 decrease down to 83% due to increase of another PAVF, which was embolized under general anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Patient was discharged on the 15th PO day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this case, there was poor preoperative response to oxygen therapy, and patient has immediately improved after surgical treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>However, after surgical resection of the largest PAVF, another <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> increased, thus leading to decrease in postoperative SpO2, reverted by embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>As the child grows, other pulmonary <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> or fistulae in other organs may be diagnosed, indicating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039445" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Rendu-Osler-Weber Syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
