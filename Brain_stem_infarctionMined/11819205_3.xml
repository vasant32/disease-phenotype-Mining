<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Clinical assessment, surgical management, and outcome of 29 children (18 girls, 11 boys) affected by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">KTS</z:e> observed from October 1998 to October 2000 were reviewed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients ranged in age from 8 months to 17 years (median age at surgery, 10.3 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The clinical findings are presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Surgical treatments included stripping of persistent marginal vein (n = 16), multiple legation of bulky <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">varicosities</z:e> (n = 10), complementary sclerotherapy (n = 14) and laser photocoagulation (n = 13), and excision of associated lymphatic malformations (n = 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No mortality or major postoperative morbidity occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Follow-up period ranged from 6 months to 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These preliminary results suggest that early surgical management of DVH in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">KTS</z:e> is safe and could be effective in preventing or minimising the long-term haemodynamic effects of DVH in absence of associated deep venous system anomalies </plain></SENT>
