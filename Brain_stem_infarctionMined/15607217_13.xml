<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The aim of this study is to document the clinical features and natural history of sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0000365'>deafness</z:hpo> associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042568" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vertebrobasilar ischemia</z:e> (VBI) and to describe the vascular topographic patterns of ischemic lesions on brain MRI associated with sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0000365'>deafness</z:hpo> based on data collected from a prospective <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From 364 consecutive cases of VBI diagnosed by clinical features and brain MRI between January 2000 and September 2003, 29 patients were identified as having sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0000365'>deafness</z:hpo> as a symptom of VBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In our series, the incidence of sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0000365'>deafness</z:hpo> following VBI is 8.0% (29/364) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hearing loss occurred unilaterally (n=27) or bilaterally (n=2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> but one had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002321'>vertigo</z:hpo> as an associated symptom </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nine patients (31%) presented with an isolated audiovestibular loss initially and subsequently had delayed neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nearly a half of patients (14/29: 48%) showed cochlear features of hearing loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Seventeen (81%) of 21 patients who were followed for at least 1 year after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0000365'>deafness</z:hpo> had a recovery of hearing partially (n=10) or completely (n=7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The improvement rate of hearing loss in patients with profound hearing loss was significantly lower than that in patients with less than profound hearing loss (40% vs. 89%, P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition to infarction in the territory of anterior inferior cerebellar artery (n=23), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0236073" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebellar infarction</z:e> in the territory of the medial branch of posterior inferior cerebellar artery (n=4) or an isolated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brainstem infarction</z:e> (n=2) was also associated with sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0000365'>deafness</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: An isolated sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0000365'>deafness</z:hpo> with cochlear audiometric features can be the initial presentation of VBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0000365'>deafness</z:hpo> due to VBI often has a good outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There is topographic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of ischemic lesions on brain MRI in patients with sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0000365'>deafness</z:hpo> due to VBI </plain></SENT>
