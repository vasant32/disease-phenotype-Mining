<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is often accompanied by visceral manifestations, and rarely combined with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001744'>splenomegaly</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE OUTLINE: A 30-year-old female patient came to the Surgery Clinic because of occasional left hypochondrial pain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After she was diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">KTS</z:e> combined with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001744'>splenomegaly</z:hpo>, splenectomy was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Macroscopic and microscopic spleen examination indicated the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> of vascular origin, presenting a combination of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100764'>lymphangioma</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001028'>hemangioma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">KTS</z:e> demands a thorough clinical examination of the patient because of the potential presence of visceral manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When <z:hpo ids='HP_0001744'>splenomegaly</z:hpo> is present, even though being often benign, splenectomy is usually performed to alleviate accompanying symptoms which occur as a result of organ enlargement and compression, to prevent rupture and consequential <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> when the vascular spleen <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> is large, and finally to avoid a possibility of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1608408" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignant transformation</z:e> </plain></SENT>
