<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This is a report of unruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> with occlusion of the basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 61-year-old female was admitted to our hospital because of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001260'>dysarthria</z:hpo> and numbness of her left face </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Angiography revealed occlusion of the basilar artery and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> of the bilateral cerebral carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pcom was not visualized on bilateral carotid angiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These neurological signs were considered to be derived from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042568" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vertebrobasilar insufficiency</z:e> by occlusion of the basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Right STA-SCA anatomosis was performed to prevent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain stem infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Postoperative angiography showed a good filling of both <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi> and SCA by collateral circulation via a right STA and an unruptured basilar top <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Seven months after the bypass surgery, angiography disclosed that the basilar top <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was visualized clearly, and its size was unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The fact that there was no <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was considered to be due to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9588">ticlopidine</z:chebi>, and the hemodynamic changes after the bypass surgery were suspected to have increased the intraaneurysmal pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore we performed neck clipping of the basilar top <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> by using a right pterional approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two years after the second operation, the patient complained of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CT scan showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, and angiography demonstrated a newly developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> which might have ruptured on left internal carotid anterior choroidal artery bifurcation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Emergency neck clipping of the second <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was performed, and the patient showed a good postoperative course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The newly developed second <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> might have been caused by severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in addition to hemodynamic stress </plain></SENT>
