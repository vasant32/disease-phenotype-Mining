<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In the management of basilar invagination, traction therapy may help by pulling down the odontoid process away from the brain stem that may result in clinical and radiological improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to discuss the role of the halo vest apparatus traction on the reduction of severe anterior compression pathologies in basilar invagination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE DESCRIPTION: We describe a simple and safe cervical traction method by the halo vest apparatus that is followed by rigid posterior occipitocervical fixation and foramen magnum decompression in a patient who presented with basilar invagination and symptoms of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002512'>brain stem compression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>-suitable halo vest apparatus was used for reduction of the deformity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The reduction of the basilar invagination was achieved gradually by distracting the halo crown in stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The halo vest apparatus can be safely used in complex craniocervical junction anomalies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An effective cervical traction can be performed in basilar invagination, and reduction of the deformity may be achieved without the risk of overdistraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In some cases, even partial reduction of the deformity may facilitate brain stem and spinal cord relief without any need of posterior decompression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients may benefit from ambulatory functions because bed rest is eliminated in this procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Neurovascular structures and the degree of the reduction can be observed on MRIs when an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>-suitable device is used </plain></SENT>
