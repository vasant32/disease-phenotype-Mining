<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of augmented trabeculectomy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> (5-FU) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27504">mitomycin C</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="172" ids="27504">MMC</z:chebi>) compared to 5-FU only for the treatment of pediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a prospective randomized clinical trial, 8 children (12 eyes) with pediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo>, either congenital or secondary to: lens <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome</z:e>, or steroids underwent augmented trabeculectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Six patients (8 eyes) underwent augmented trabeculectomy with 5-FU plus <z:chebi fb="172" ids="27504">MMC</z:chebi> and 2 patients (4 eyes) underwent augmented trabeculectomy with 5-FU only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Between-group comparison of postoperative parameters: change in intraocular pressure (IOP), dependence on antiglaucoma medication, number of 5-FU injections, cup-disc ratio, corneal diameter, drug-induced complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the 5-FU/<z:chebi fb="172" ids="27504">MMC</z:chebi> group, 7/8 eyes showed good control of postoperative IOP (9-16 mm Hg), which was independent of antiglaucoma therapy; only 2 injections of 5-FU were needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By contrast, in the 5-FU group, no control of the postoperative IOP (21-23 mm Hg) was achieved in 4/4 eyes, and these patients remained dependent on antiglaucoma medication; up to 6 injections of 5-FU were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no deterioration in the cup-disc ratio or the corneal diameter in either group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results were maintained on follow-up (23-27 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant drug-induced complications were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Augmented trabeculectomy with adjunctive 5-FU/<z:chebi fb="172" ids="27504">MMC</z:chebi> may be an option for the control of pediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> in patients with a poor surgical prognosis </plain></SENT>
