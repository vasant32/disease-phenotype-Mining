<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A long-term follow-up study (minimum duration 2 years) was made of 13 patients with tortuous dilated basilar arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of these, five patients had symptoms related to the presence of such arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Symptoms present at a very early stage included <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042568" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vertebrobasilar insufficiency</z:e> in two patients, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brainstem infarction</z:e> in two patients, and left <z:hpo ids='HP_0010828'>hemifacial spasm</z:hpo> in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Initial magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) imaging in serial slices of basilar arteries obtained from the five symptomatic patients showed an intimal flap or a subadventitial <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp>, both of which are characteristic of a dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the basilar arteries in the eight asymptomatic patients did not show particular findings and they remained clinically and radiologically silent during the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the lesions in the five symptomatic patients gradually grew to fantastic sizes, with progressive deterioration of the related clinical symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Dilation of the basilar artery was consistent with <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> into the "pseudolumen" within the laminated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e>, which was confirmed by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the five symptomatic patients studied, two died of fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) and two of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002512'>brainstem compression</z:hpo>; the fifth patient remains alive without neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the three patients who underwent autopsy, a definite macroscopic double lumen was observed in both the proximal and distal ends of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> within the layer of the thickening intima </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Microscopically, multiple mural dissections, fragmentation of internal elastic lamina (IEL), and degeneration of media were diffusely observed in the remarkably extended wall of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The substantial mechanism of pathogenesis and enlargement in the symptomatic, highly tortuous dilated artery might initially be macroscopic dissection within a thickening intima and subsequent repetitive hemorrhaging within a laminated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> in the pseudolumen combined with microscopic multiple mural dissections on the basis of a weakened IEL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The authors note and caution that symptomatic, tortuous dilated basilar arteries cannot be overlooked because they include a group of malignant arteries that may grow rapidly, resulting in a fatal course </plain></SENT>
