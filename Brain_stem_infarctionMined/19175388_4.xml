<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the clinical characteristics, surgical challenges, and outcome in children younger than 3 years of age undergoing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> surgery in Canada </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Retrospective data on patients younger than age 3 years who underwent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> surgery at multiple centers across Canada from January 1987 to September 2005 were collected and analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 116 patients from eight centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>Seizure</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> was in the first year of life in 82%, and mean age at first surgery was 15.8 months (1-35 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Second surgeries were done in 27 patients, and a third surgery in 6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Etiologies were malformations of cortical development (57), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> (22), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome</z:e> (19), <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> (8), and other (10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Surgeries comprised 40 hemispheric operations, 33 cortical resections, 35 lesionectomies, 7 temporal lobectomies, and one callosotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was one surgical mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The most common surgical complications (151 operations in 116 patients) were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> (17) and aseptic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> in 13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of 107 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> outcome assessed more than one year postoperatively, 72 (67.3%) were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> free (Engel I), 15(14%) had &gt;90% improvement (Engel II), 12 had &gt;50% improvement (Engel III), and 8 did not benefit from surgery (Engel IV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Development improved in 55.3% after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Epilepsy</z:e> surgery in children younger than 3 years of age is relatively safe and is effective in controlling <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Very young age is not a contraindication to surgery in children with refractory <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e>, and early surgery may impact development positively </plain></SENT>
