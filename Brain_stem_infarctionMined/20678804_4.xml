<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To assess the histopathologic changes in a postmortem sample derived from an eye donor with macular <z:hpo ids='HP_0001009'>telangiectasia</z:hpo> (MacTel) type 2 to gain further insight into the cause of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Clinicopathological case report </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: Postmortem tissue was collected from 5 different donors: 1 MacTel type 2 patient; 1 healthy control; 2 type 2 diabetic patients, 1 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> and 1 without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo>; and 1 patient with unilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0154832" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Coat's disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Macular pigment distribution in the posterior part of freshly dissected eyes was documented by macrophotography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Paraffin sections from both the macular and peripheral regions were assessed using antigen retrieval and immunohistochemistry to study the distribution of cell-specific markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Blood vessels were visualized with antibodies directed against collagen IV and claudin 5; glial cells with antibodies against glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), vimentin, glutamine synthetase (GS), and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17898">retinaldehyde</z:chebi> binding protein (RLBP1, also known as CRALBP); microglia with an antibody against allograft inflammatory factor 1 (also known as Iba1); and photoreceptors with antibodies against rhodopsin and opsin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using anatomic landmarks, the sections then were matched with the macular pigment distribution and a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi> angiogram of the patient that was obtained before the patient's <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Presence and distribution of macular pigment and cell-specific markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Macular pigment was absent in the macula </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, abnormally dilated capillaries were identified in a macular region that correlated spatially with regions of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi> leakage in an angiogram that was obtained 12 years before <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These telangiectatic vessels displayed a marked reduction of the basement membrane component collagen IV, indicating vascular pathologic features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The presence of GFAP was limited to <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> astrocytes, and no reactive M端ller cells were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Importantly, reduced immunoreactivity with M端ller cell markers (vimentin, GS, and RLBP1) in the macula was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The area that lacked M端ller cells corresponded with the region of depleted macular pigment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that macular M端ller cell loss or dysfunction is a critical component of MacTel type 2, which may have implications for future treatment strategies </plain></SENT>
