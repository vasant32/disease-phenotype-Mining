<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Aortic endovascular stent-graft implantation is associated with low morbidity and mortality rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Overstenting of the left subclavian artery may be necessary to create a satisfactory proximal 'landing zone' for the stent-graft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Few cases have been published reporting adverse neurological events after overstenting of the left subclavian artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We thus evaluated whether this procedure is associated with a higher rate of neurological complications by focusing on the management of the supra-aortic vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty patients suffering from aortic arch <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> (n=3), <z:hpo ids='HP_0004954'>descending aortic aneurysms</z:hpo> (n=7), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> (n=6) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> (n=4) type-B <z:hpo ids='HP_0002647'>aortic dissections</z:hpo> underwent stent-graft repair with complete (n=14) or partial (n=6) overstenting of the left subclavian artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three patients underwent overstenting of the entire aortic arch with ascending aortic-bi-carotid bypass grafting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One patient with right carotid and vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> underwent initial carotid-to-subclavian bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients subsequently underwent neurological examination and Doppler ultrasound for detection of neurological and peripheral vascular complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Aortic stent-graft repair was successful in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> neurologic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two patients developed late central adverse neurological events: right-sided vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brainstem infarction</z:e> (n=1) and impaired binocular vision combined with dizziness (n=1), necessitating secondary subclavian transposition in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Peripheral symptoms related to occlusion of the left subclavian artery were observed in five patients as sensory and motoric deficits of the left hand and arm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Overstenting of the left subclavian artery as treatment of aortic pathologies in high-risk patients is feasible but associated with the risk of neurological complications and peripheral symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Side effects were mild or transient in most of our patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Detailed preoperative exploration of vascular <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> and pathology via Doppler ultrasound, CT- or MRI scan is mandatory to avoid adverse neurological events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Prior surgical revascularization of the left subclavian artery is essential in patients with high-grade stenoses, occlusions, or anatomic variants of the supra-aortic branches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Delayed surgical revascularization is necessary only in patients with relevant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038531" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">subclavian steal syndrome</z:e> or severe peripheral vascular symptoms </plain></SENT>
