<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to evaluate our experience with surgical and diagnostic management to provide a surgical pathway to help surgeons treat this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: We retrospectively reviewed five patients who were managed surgically between 1999 and 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent structured diagnostic and treatment protocols </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The functional outcome was evaluated using the Constant Score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: The patients had the following underlying medical conditions: <z:hpo ids='HP_0012118'>laryngeal cancer</z:hpo>, port-explantation linked to a rectum <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0012624" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">spondylodiscitis</z:e>, and brain stem <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> with reduced general condition; one patient had no underlying medical problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three patients underwent a simple incision, debridement and drainage, and two patients underwent an extended intervention with partial resection of the sternoclavicular joint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean duration of follow-up was 29 months (range 24-36 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had well-healed wounds without signs of reinfection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The Constant Score for the functional outcome at the time of the last follow-up was 76 points (range 67-93 points) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients recovered completely from SCJ disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our recommendations for the management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003095'>septic arthritis</z:hpo> of the sternoclavicular joint include standard treatment steps and assessments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The early stages of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> can be managed by simple incision, debridement and drainage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In advanced stages of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, a more radical intervention is preferable </plain></SENT>
