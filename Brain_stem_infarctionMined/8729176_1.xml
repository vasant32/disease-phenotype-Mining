<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Before treatment almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients responded to posture by a rise in <z:chebi fb="47" ids="28918,33568">adrenaline</z:chebi> (A) excretion and by a <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> in <z:chebi fb="15" ids="33569">noradrenaline</z:chebi> (NA) excretion </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As post-orthostatic A discharge observed in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001278'>postural hypotension</z:hpo> is involved in the pathogeny of this syndrome and both metoclopramide and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8499">propranolol</z:chebi> are able to correct this disorder one may maintain that the clinical favourable results obtained with these drugs are ascribable at least partly to their blocking effect on A release </plain></SENT>
