<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In an initial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) within the first 2 weeks, the medial cerebellar peduncles showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> intensities, but a control MRI after 4 months showed bright hyperintensities in the T2-TSE weighted images, and moderately increased signal intensities in echo planar imaging-diffusion weighted imaging were seen, possibly representing bilateral Wallerian degeneration of the cerebellar-pontine fibers </plain></SENT>
