<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have developed and describe a pointing device controlled by DC-coupled electrooculograms (EOGs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The visual angle of the subject is estimated from the amplitude of vertical and horizontal EOGs for determining the two-dimensional pointing position on a PC screen in real time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The eye blinking artifact is reduced using a median filter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Electrode displacement is corrected by considering the potential gradient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the position error caused by drift phenomenon is adjusted using head movement based on the vestibule-ocular reflex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The accuracy and operating speed of the proposed method were evaluated among a group of human subjects </plain></SENT>
