<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Dealing with individuals with LIS and a poor prognosis raises the issue of introducing end-of-life discussions with the patient and/or family in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> period of the illness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Existing literature regarding LIS provides little guidance about end-of-life decision-making in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> management phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We aim to provide some guidance for clinicians holding end-of-life discussions in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> management period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We report two cases of relatively young individuals with LIS secondary to brainstem <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both cases had a very poor prognosis and end-of-life discussions were commenced by the treating team in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Despite the severity of their conditions, in neither case were end-of-life discussions well tolerated by the family in the weeks following admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We suggest that LIS patients and their families, who have chosen to persist with full medical management after diagnosis of LIS, should be provided with sufficient time to adjust to the catastrophic changes that have occurred before further end-of-life discussions are pursued </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Education and support are likely to be highly beneficial in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> period post <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> as they allow the patient and family to develop a realistic understanding of the likely outcomes of their decisions </plain></SENT>
