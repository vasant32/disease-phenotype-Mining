<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The male patient aged 65 visited the eye clinic with presenting symptom of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> of the left eye for 2 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ocular examination disclosed a <z:hpo ids='HP_0000329'>facial hemangioma</z:hpo> with the size of 2 cm x 3 cm on the nasal side of the left upper eyelid associated with engorged bulbar conjunctival and episcleral vessels in the upper nasal quadrant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ophthalmoscopy revealed total detachment of the retina </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000565'>Esotropia</z:hpo> was measured as 10 degrees </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intraocular pressure was 24 mmHg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Electroretinogram (ERG) demonstrated an indistinguished pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Posterior trans-scleral and ciliary body cryocoagulation was applied followed by external release of the subretinal fluid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The retina became reattached with visual acuity of 0.3 and intraocular pressure was 15 mmHg of the left eye at 5 months postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">Fluorescein</z:chebi> angiographical findings were consistent with diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0001028'>hemangioma</z:hpo> of the choroid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Follow-up study for 6 years revealed that the retina remained attached with visual acuity of 0.8 and essentially <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> electroretinogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The small <z:hpo ids='HP_0000329'>facial hemangioma</z:hpo> was the clue for the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome</z:e> and cryocoagulation was the procedure of choice for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000541'>retinal detachment</z:hpo> with favorable visual outcome </plain></SENT>
