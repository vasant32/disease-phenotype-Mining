<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Patients were enrolled in this prospective cohort during a period of 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Pediatric neurology clinic with national referral through the Sturge-Weber Foundation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-one children (age range, 1 year 6 months to 10 years 4 months) with unilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cortical gray matter and hemispheric white matter volumes were measured on segmented volumetric magnetic resonance imaging and correlated with the age of the participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Global intellectual function (IQ) was correlated with magnetic resonance imaging and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> variables in both univariate and multivariate analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both gray and white matter volumes showed an age-related linear increase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Tissue volumes on the side of the <z:mp ids='MP_0002947'>angioma</z:mp> showed a positive correlation with IQ after controlling for age in univariate regression analyses (white matter, r = 0.71, P &lt; .001; gray matter, r = 0.48, P = .03), while <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> variables did not correlate with IQ (P &gt; .1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A multivariate regression showed that hemispheric white matter volume ipsilateral to the <z:mp ids='MP_0002947'>angioma</z:mp> was an independent predictor of IQ (R = 61, P = .006), which also showed a negative correlation with age (R = - 0.52, P = .022) but no correlation with gray matter volumes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Early hemispheric white matter loss may play a major role in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Future therapeutic approaches should aim at preserving white matter integrity in addition to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> control to improve cognitive outcome </plain></SENT>
