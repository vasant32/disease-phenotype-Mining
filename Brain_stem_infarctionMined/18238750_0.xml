<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To describe a case of Klippel-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Tr</z:e>énaunay syndrome in an adult patient with symmetric macromelia suggestive of an acromegaloid syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We report clinical and laboratory data that were extracted from the medical records of the study patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also survey the relevant reports identified through a MEDLINE search of the English-language literature published between January 1, 1996, and June 2, 2007, using the phrase, Klippel-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Tr</z:e>énaunay syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A 28-year-old man was admitted to the hospital for weeping <z:hpo ids='HP_0001004'>lymphedema</z:hpo> of the left lower extremity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>He had pronounced symmetric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> distal extremities, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001052'>port-wine stains</z:hpo> on his right neck, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">varicosities</z:e> on his left groin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patient's insulinlike growth factor 1 concentration was 92 ng/mL (reference range, 117-329 ng/mL), which did not support the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000845'>acromegaly</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Klippel-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Tr</z:e>énaunay syndrome is a rare congenital condition that belongs to a family of disorders characterized by tissue <z:hpo ids='HP_0001548'>overgrowth</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Classically, the syndrome presents as a triad of vascular malformations, cutaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001028'>hemangiomas</z:hpo>, and bone or soft-tissue <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> usually affecting one extremity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The tissue <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> in this syndrome is typically localized and asymmetric </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The recognition that the tissue <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> in Klippel-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Tr</z:e>énaunay syndrome can occur symmetrically will help avoid unnecessary and extensive workup for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000845'>acromegaly</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
