<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From September 1995 to January 2001, 32 cases of vascular malformations were identified by means of color Doppler ultrasonography and spectral wave analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography, angiography, or both were performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Five arterioportal and 14 portovenous malformations, 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformation</z:hpo>, and 4 portoportal and 8 venovenous shunts were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Associations with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039445" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Rendu-Osler-Weber syndrome</z:e> in 6 cases and with cirrhotic liver in 12 cases were found Fourteen patients were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver disease</z:e> free </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 3 cases, interventional procedures were necessary to reduce <z:hpo ids='HP_0001409'>portal hypertension</z:hpo> or cardiac dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The incidence of finding vascular malformations in 12,000 patients was 0.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Nontumorous vascular malformations are <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0678236" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rare disorders</z:e> in the liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>They may appear in patients with healthy livers and in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001409'>portal hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Color Doppler ultrasonography and spectral wave analysis are capable of showing and differentiating different types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006576'>hepatic vascular malformations</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
