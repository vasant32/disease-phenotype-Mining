<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A retrospective chart review of physiatric evaluation of 30 individuals, aged 4 mos to 55 yrs (median age, 2.4 yrs), with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome</z:e> with brain involvement was conducted for the purpose of summarizing physiatric findings and recommendations in this cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Presence or absence of motor, cognitive, and behavioral concerns and need for orthoses, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001257'>spasticity</z:hpo> management, and therapy services were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>Hemiparesis</z:hpo> was common, but the need for intervention for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001257'>spasticity</z:hpo> was rare </plain></SENT>
