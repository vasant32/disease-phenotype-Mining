<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A case of progressive congenital <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> of the feet was presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>From a diagnostic standpoint, this case was extremely challenging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0431279" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Local gigantism</z:e> was excluded from the diagnosis because the deformity was localized to both feet, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> components showing a concomitant increase in size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, there was no evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001067'>neurofibromatosis</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004947'>arteriovenous fistula</z:hpo> formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Other conditions leading to lower extremity <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath>, ie, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022739" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="KTS">Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome</z:e> and other diseases associated with angiodystrophy, were excluded because of the absence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">varicosities</z:e> and cutaneous <z:mp ids='MP_0002947'>angiomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There also was no evidence of an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001624" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">adrenal tumor</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1704356" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">enchondromas</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was, however, a slight increase in the temperature of the left limb and an increase in the amount of vascular channels of the lower extremity, which may relate to an obscure form of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0267370,C0085411" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">angiodysplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the patient's mother took thalidomide during pregnancy, which has been shown to cause a large range of limb deformities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The authors believe that it is appropriate to classify this case as an idiopathic form of progressive congenital <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath>, localized to the feet of a 25-year-old Caucasian female </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The goal of treatment is primarily two-fold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>First, progressive narrowing of the forefoot should be obtained through closing wedge osteotomies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Second, multi-stage debulking of the muscle tissue should be performed, with associated skin reductions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The authors believe that this is the first reported case of bilateral muscular and bony <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> of the feet, which was present at birth and continued to increase after the cessation of skeletal growth </plain></SENT>
