<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review in a tertiary referral center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 400 patients who underwent surgical removal of <z:hpo ids='HP_0009588'>vestibular schwannoma</z:hpo> from 1984 to 2000,symptoms, preoperative evaluation, surgery, and postoperative complications were analyzed using standardized grading systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred ninety-four men and 206 women had an operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean age was 53.9 years (age range, 11-78 y) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> size according to Koos stage was stage 1 in 39 cases, stage 2 in 122 cases, stage 3 in 87 cases, and stage 4 in 152 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Preoperatively, 7.5% of patients had facial nerve dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Surgical approaches were translabyrinthine in 229 patients, widened retrolabyrinthine in 128 cases, suboccipital in 42 cases, and transotic in 1 case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mortality was 0.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Facial nerve was transected in 15 cases (3.7%) and immediately repaired in 5 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A delayed hypoglossal-to-facial nerve anastomosis was performed in 12 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At 1 year, House-Brackmann grade in 70.7% of patients was 1 to 2; in 24.3%, 3 to 4; and in 5%, 5 to 6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Poor facial nerve outcome was correlated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> size, preoperative irradiation, and nerve dysfunction and was not correlated with the approach used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Most patients had postoperative dizziness, and 30% still had vestibular disturbances after 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Nine patients (2.2%) had a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007815" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea</z:e>, and 24 had a cerebrospinal fluid wound leak (6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two patients (5.5%) had postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Two patients had a cerebellopontine angle <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, and three a brainstem <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Transpetrosal approaches (translabyrinthine, widened retrolabyrinthine) are safe for <z:hpo ids='HP_0009588'>vestibular schwannoma</z:hpo> removal, and rates of postoperative complications and sequelae are decreasing </plain></SENT>
