<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe a non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">Parkinson disease</z:e> case of nonpharmacologically induced punding as a complication of a brain stem cardiovascular accident </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY OF CASE: A 54-year-old man, after an episode of brain stem cardiovascular accident secondary to basilar artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, was noted to endlessly purchase and hoard food items and to write, copy and organize recipes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>His activity was excessive, disruptive and affected his interaction with family members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient's punding behaviors significantly improved with an increased dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9123">sertraline</z:chebi> from 100 mg to 150 mg per day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our patient's presentation was most consistent with punding, but interestingly was not a result of dopaminergic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, improvement of his behavior was noted with a selective <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> reuptake inhibitor, further questioning the dopaminergic hypothesis of punding </plain></SENT>
