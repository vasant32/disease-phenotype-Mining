<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of primary single-plate Molteno tube implantation in the management of childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Nine eyes of seven patients were included in this prospective case series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Success was defined as intraocular pressure (IOP) &lt; or =22 mmHg with (relative success) or without (absolute success) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> medications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intra- and postoperative complications were also evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean age at the time of the surgery was 9.6 +/- 3.7 years (range: 5-17 years) and mean follow-up duration was 32 +/- 4.7 months (range: 20-36 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean IOP was reduced from 34.2 +/- 8.3 mmHg preoperatively to 21.2 +/- 7.3 mmHg at the final follow-up (P = 0.012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The number of anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> medications was reduced from 3.4 +/- 0.5 preoperatively to 2.2 +/- 1.3 at the final follow-up (P = 0.058) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cumulative probability of relative success was 97.2% [95% confidence interval (CI): 91.85-100%] at 12 months, 78.02% (95% CI: 60.36-95.67%) at 24 months and 43.34% (95% CI: 16.18-70.5%) at the final follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During the first 6 months after surgery, two patients had controlled IOP without the use of medications (absolute success); however, 6 months and later no eye had achieved absolute success </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no intraoperative complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Postoperative complications included <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0339434" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">choroidal effusion</z:e> necessitating drainage in three eyes (33.3%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000518'>cataract</z:hpo> formation in <z:mp ids='MP_0005163'>one eye</z:mp> (11%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000541'>retinal detachment</z:hpo> in <z:mp ids='MP_0005163'>one eye</z:mp> (11%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At the final follow-up, visual acuity was unchanged from preoperative values in five eyes (55.5%); no eye demonstrated visual improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Outcomes of this small case study reveal that primary single-plate Molteno tube implantation appears to be associated with a limited success rate and a relatively high complication rate in eyes of children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> resulting from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
