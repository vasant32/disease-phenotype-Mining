<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To describe the gray-scale and color Doppler ultrasound imaging features of vascular canals in human femoral condylar epiphysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Vascular canals in the femoral condylar epiphysis were examined using gray-scale and Doppler US </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study was performed in 45 volunteers (aged &lt;1 month-72 years) who comprised 1 subject with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004322'>short stature</z:hpo>, 1 subject with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022739" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="KTS">Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome</z:e> and 43 subjects with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the 8-year-old and younger group (n=34), vascular canals were observed in 32 subjects (94%), whereas vascular canals were not observed in the 9-year-old and older group (n=11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Vascular canals were visualized as hyperechoic lines and dots </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With Doppler US, blood flow in the vascular canals was observed in 20 of the 32 subjects (62.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Spectral Doppler analysis was possible in 15 subjects, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of whom only arterial waveforms were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: US was helpful to delineate the vascular canals and flow therein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The detection and evaluation of vascular canals and blood flow therein may prove useful in understanding growth </plain></SENT>
