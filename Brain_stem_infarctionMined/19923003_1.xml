<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To identify clinical and pupillographic features of patients with a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0549122" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">relative afferent pupillary defect</z:e> (RAPD) without visual acuity or visual field loss caused by a lesion in the dorsal midbrain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Experimental study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS AND CONTROLS: Four patients with a dorsal midbrain lesion who had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> visual fields and a clinically detectable RAPD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The pupil response from full-field and hemifield light stimulation over a range of light intensities was measured by computerized binocular pupillography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The mean of the direct and consensual pupil response to full-field and hemifield light stimulation was plotted as a function of stimulus light intensity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 4 subjects showed decreased pupillographic responses at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> intensities to full-field light stimulation in the eye with the clinical RAPD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The pupillographic responses to hemifield stimulation showed a homonymous pattern of deficit on the side ipsilateral to the RAPD, similar to that observed in a previously reported patient with an optic tract lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The basis of a midbrain RAPD is the nasal-temporal asymmetry of pupillomotor input that becomes manifest when a unilateral postchiasmal lesion interrupts homonymously paired fibers traveling in the contralateral optic tract or midbrain pathway to the pupillomotor center, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The pupillographic characteristics of an RAPD resulting from a dorsal midbrain lesion thus resemble those of an RAPD resulting from a unilateral optic tract lesion, but without the homonymous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001123'>visual field defect</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
