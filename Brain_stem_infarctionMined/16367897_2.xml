<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> are usually fed by nasogastric tube </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, this method sometimes causes <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the use of a new feeding procedure called intermittent <z:chebi fb="39" ids="29287">oro</z:chebi>-esophageal (IOE) tube feeding in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The IOE method was used in 13 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients (68 +/- 14 years old; 12 had a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brainstem infarction</z:e>), who were alert, but had severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> and a weak pharyngeal reflex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IOE tube feeding was carried out as follows </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A feeding tube was passed orally into the lower portion of the esophagus, food supplements were administered through the tube at a rate of approximately 50 ml/min, and the tube was removed after finishing the supplement infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found that the IOE method had the following advantages: (i) IOE feeding took approximately 15 min; (ii) potentially reduced a risk of complications such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo>; and (iii) oral tube insertion stimulated the oral cavity and pharynx, which may improve the swallowing function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the IOE feeding method should not be used in patients who: (i) could not understand the IOE procedure; (ii) had an esophageal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002036'>hiatal hernia</z:hpo> or incomplete peristalsis of the esophagus, as such patients are at risk of having the supplement reflux into the oral cavity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The IOE feeding method may be one of the alternatives to continuous nasogastric tube feeding in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo>, who are alert </plain></SENT>
