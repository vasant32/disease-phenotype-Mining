<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A simple and precise classification has been established during a ten-year international cooperation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are two major groups: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001028'>hemangiomas</z:hpo>, always regressive; and vascular malformations, which never regress; they grow, throughout life, to varying degrees </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Management of vascular malformations has been clearly defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Capillary malformations do not require examination, unless they are associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0158795" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">other anomalies</z:e>, such as hypertrophic underlying bone, or the leptomeningeal vascular anomaly of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Venous type malformations are diffuse, and consist of entirely anomalous channels, with low flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CT scan and MRI clearly demonstrate the extent of tissue involvement in venous malformations; for these slow-flow malformations the evaluation is performed without resorting to invasive diagnostic techniques: phlebography is rarely performed, and arteriography is unnecessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>Arteriovenous malformations</z:hpo> are dangerous high-flow vascular malformations, leading to skin ischemic <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp>, and congestive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>cardiac failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Arteriography shows enlarged tortuous arteries, with arteriovenous shunting, and early venous drainage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CT scan and MRI show the deep components of the lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Doppler ultrasound evaluation is used to follow the course of the disease </plain></SENT>
