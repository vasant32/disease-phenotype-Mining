<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The Pipeline embolization device (PED) is a new endoluminal construct designed to exclude <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> from the parent cerebrovasculature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report the very late (&gt;1 year) <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of a PED construct placed for the treatment of a left vertebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A patient with an occluded right vertebral artery and a large, fusiform intracranial left vertebral artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was treated with PED and coil reconstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A durable, complete occlusion of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was confirmed with control angiography at 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient remained neurologically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> for 23 months until he experienced a transient visual disturbance followed weeks later by a minor brainstem <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: Imaging evaluation showed <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the PED construct with complete occlusion of the left vertebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After this <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, he was initially treated with dual antiplatelet therapy and was then converted to <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patient remained neurologically stable for 5 months until he experienced progressive basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> that ultimately resulted in a fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The PED represents a promising new endovascular technology for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysms</z:hpo>; however, as an investigational device, long-term follow-up data are sparse at this point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The etiology of the very late <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the PED construct in this case remains unknown; however, this report underscores the need for a continued, careful systematic evaluation and close long-term follow-up of treated patients </plain></SENT>
