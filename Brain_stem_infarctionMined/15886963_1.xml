<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients who have persistent soilage of the upper respiratory tract despite discontinuing oral intake may be offered surgical intervention to avoid life-threatening <z:hpo ids='HP_0006532'>pulmonary infections</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The Lindeman procedures (tracheoesophageal diversion and laryngotracheal separation) have gained popularity as surgical treatments for intractable <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> because of their efficacy in preventing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> and their technical simplicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A major downside of these procedures is the necessity for a tracheostoma and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002371'>loss of speech</z:hpo> following surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rarely, patients recover from the neurologic deficits which led to their intractable <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> and desire reversal of their Lindeman procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>While few "successful" reversals have been reported, detailed accounts of the long-term results of such patients are lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We describe a patient who underwent a laryngotracheal separation for intractable <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> following a brainstem <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the following six months he experienced significant neurologic recovery and, after careful evaluation, underwent surgical restoration of laryngotracheal continuity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Five years later he speaks fluently and has no dietary restrictions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Videofluooroscopic examination and quantitative voice analysis reveal near-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> laryngeal function </plain></SENT>
