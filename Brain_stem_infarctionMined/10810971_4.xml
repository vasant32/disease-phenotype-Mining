<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patient presented with extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0003764'>nevus</z:hpo> and swelling of the left lower limb since birth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>She was diagnosed with Klippel-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505,C0022739,C0455717" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Weber syndrome</z:e> by angiography at the age of 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Gross <z:hpo ids='HP_0000790'>hematuria</z:hpo> had been observed since she was 1 year old and, in addition, endoscopic examination revealed diffuse bladder <z:hpo ids='HP_0001028'>hemangiomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At 8 years of age, gross <z:hpo ids='HP_0000790'>hematuria</z:hpo> became worse and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001288'>gait disturbance</z:hpo> also appeared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>She was referred to the Department of Urology at Tohoku University School of Medicine for endoscopic treatment in June 1998 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Under general anesthesia, the bladder was inflated with <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> gas and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001028'>hemangiomas</z:hpo> were coagulated by Nd:YAG laser photonic irradiation endoscopically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Gross <z:hpo ids='HP_0000790'>hematuria</z:hpo> was markedly improved immediately following this treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Klippel-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505,C0022739,C0455717" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Weber syndrome</z:e> is a rather uncommon disease which shows various types of vascular anomaly and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> of the lower extremities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three to 6% of the patients have associated bladder <z:hpo ids='HP_0001028'>hemangiomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although Nd:YAG laser irradiation provides results superior to alternative therapy and is the preferred treatment for most patients with bladder <z:hpo ids='HP_0001028'>hemangioma</z:hpo>, in this case, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001028'>hemangiomas</z:hpo> are multiple and present the possibility of re-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, therefore long-term and close follow up is important </plain></SENT>
