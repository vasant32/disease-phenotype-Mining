<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using the BiPAP as a full ventilatory support is new due to the recent addition of a timed control modus and individual control of inspiratory time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used the new BiPAP ST-System in one young men with Duchenne-disease, one man with heredo <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> (Friedreich), one women with <z:hpo ids='HP_0007269'>spinal muscular atrophy</z:hpo>, one man with <z:hpo ids='HP_0010536'>central sleep apnea</z:hpo> due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brainstem infarction</z:e> as well as two women and one men with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002751'>kyphoscoliosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had a significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002791'>hypoventilation</z:hpo> and hypoxemia at night, which was documented by polysomnography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mechanical ventilation at night with nasal BiPAP increased the baseline oxygen saturation (SaO2) by an average of 11.9% in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> seven patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The frequency of desaturations below 90% diminished by an average of 81% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The lowest SaO2 measured increased by 28% in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> seven patients combined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001867'>Rhinitis</z:mp> due to the dryness of the inspired air were noticed in only two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two other patients needed adaptation to the customized mask </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The nasal BiPAP-System using the T-mode is a useful device to support ventilation at night and thus it could replace ventilatory support by the IPPV-mode in many patients </plain></SENT>
