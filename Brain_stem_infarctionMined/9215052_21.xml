<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM/BACKGROUND: The most common choice of treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0346390" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">choroidal haemangiomas</z:e> (CH) in the past has been the employment of scatter photocoagulation of the surface </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This management often requires repetitive treatment or additional invasive management due to massive exudative detachment of the retina </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this retrospective study was to investigate the outcome of the alternative application of low dose external beam irradiation with high energetic <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photons</z:chebi> on these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total absorbed dose of 20 Gy was applied to a total of 51 symptomatic eyes: 36 with a circumscribed CH of the posterior pole and 15 with diffuse CH as part of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The indication for treatment was an exudative <z:hpo ids='HP_0000541'>retinal detachment</z:hpo> including or threatening the fovea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean follow up times in each group were 4.5 and 5.3 years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Out of a group of 33 patients from whom reliable data could be derived, 17 had symptoms lasting longer than 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 23 cases (63.8%) with circumscribed CH complete resolution of the subretinal fluid was achieved; the remaining 13 cases (36.2%) showed residual serous detachment distant to the fovea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The visual acuity improved by two or more lines in 14 cases (38.9%), remained stable in 14 cases (38.9%), and decreased in eight cases (22.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The functional success was dependent on the lag duration between <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of first subjective symptoms and treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The morphological results with diffuse CH were similar to those of the group of circumscribed CH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The visual acuity (VA) at last examination was improved in seven cases (46.6%); in the remaining eight cases, VA was unchanged or had deteriorated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The poor functional outcome in the latter was mainly attributable to secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: External beam irradiation is a useful and a low invasive therapeutic option for CH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>A successful functional outcome is dependent on the time delay between first <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms and the beginning of therapy, the formation of subretinal <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp>, and also on secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> in the case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
