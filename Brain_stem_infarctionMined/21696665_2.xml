<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eleven consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> intracerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusions</z:mp> were treated with a self-expandable fully retrievable intracranial stent (Solitaire AB) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four patients had an occlusion of the basilar artery, five had a middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and two had terminal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusions</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recanalization results were assessed by follow-up angiography immediately after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neurologic status was evaluated before and after treatment (90-day follow-up) according to the National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) and modified Rankin scales (mRS).Successful revascularization (TICI 2a/b and 3) was achieved in 11 of 11 (100%) patients, a TICI 3 state was accomplished in two (18%) patients, and partial recanalization or slow distal branch filling with filling of more than two-thirds of the vessel territory (TICI 2a/2b) was achieved in nine (82%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The stent was removed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean time from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> to recanalization was 339 minutes (+/- 114.3 minutes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>NIHSS on admission was 16.09 (+/- 4.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Almost two-thirds of the patients (61.2%) improved by &gt;6 points on the NIHSS at discharge, and 30% showed a mRS of &lt;2 at 90 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mortality was 9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One patient with a BA occlusion had a massive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain stem infarction</z:e> and died two days after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were no <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhages</z:hpo>.The use of the Solitaire in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients shows encouraging results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, further prospective large randomized trials are mandatory to confirm these early results </plain></SENT>
