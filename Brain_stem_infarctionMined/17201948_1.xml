<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This syndrome may involve bladder, kidney, urethra, ureter and genitals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report the treatment of 7 KTWS patients with urogenital involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: From 1995 to 2005, 7 patients with KTWS were evaluated and the charts of these patients were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients' median age was 19-years (range 4 to 46-years) and only 1 was female </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The clinical presentation included genital deformities in 3 cases, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000790'>hematuria</z:hpo> in 2 and urethrorragia in 2, one of which associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000028'>cryptorchidism</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001741'>phimosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three patients had an association of pelvic and genital malformations, including 2 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000790'>hematuria</z:hpo> due to vesical lesions and 1 patient with left <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1168284" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ureterohydronephrosis</z:e> due to a pelvic mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two patients had urethral lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Treatment included endoscopic laser coagulation for 1 patient with recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000790'>hematuria</z:hpo> and 1 patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1408027" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">urethrorrhagia</z:e>, pelvic radiotherapy for 1 patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000790'>hematuria</z:hpo> and circumcision in 2 patients with genital deformities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One patient required placement of a double-J catheter to relieve obstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000790'>Hematuria</z:hpo> and urethrorragia were safely and effectively controlled with laser applications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Circumcision was also effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The patient treated with radiotherapy developed a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268854" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">contracted bladder</z:e> and required a continent urinary diversion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Urogenital involvement in patients with KTWS is not rare and must be suspected in the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000790'>hematuria</z:hpo> or significant cutaneous deformity of the external genitalia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Surgical treatment may be warranted in selected cases </plain></SENT>
