<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarctions</z:e> in 51 patients were examined on diffusion-weighted imaging using low field MRI within 48 hours after clinical symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diffusion-weighted imaging was examined using line scan method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four cases were cortical infarction, and twenty-two cases were perforating infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In five cases out of 51 cases, ischemic regions were not detected as abnormal high signal intensity area on diffusion-weighted imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four cases of no abnormal detection were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo>, and the other one was a perforating infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The earliest detection time in cortical infarction cases was 1 hour and 20 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the earliest detection time in perforating infarction cases was 3 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Detective ability for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> on diffusion-weighted imaging by low field MRI was depending on both size and lesion of infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>That is to say, either small size or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain stem infarction</z:e> was hard to detect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thin slice and vertical slice examination for the infarction may improve to diagnose in low field MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our conclusion is <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> was able to be diagnosed on diffusion-weighted imaging by low field as well as high field MRI </plain></SENT>
