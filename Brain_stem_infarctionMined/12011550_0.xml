<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study includes 5 patients with unilateral pontine base infarction who developed another infarction on the opposite side and, for comparison, 10 follow-up period-matched patients with unilateral pontine base infarction who did not develop recurrent pontine infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MRI and angiogram studies were performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The two groups were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The patients with recurrent pontine base infarction developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002273'>quadriparesis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001260'>dysarthria</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MRI showed bilateral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> abutting on the basal surface of the pons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Angiogram studies revealed diseased basilar artery in 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no differences regarding age, gender, angiogram findings and frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, cigarette smoking and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo> between the patients with recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and those without </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the former had a significantly higher number of risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (p &lt; 0.05) and higher frequency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> (p &lt; 0.05) than the latter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The number of risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and a concomitant presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> may be factors related to recurrent pontine base infarction in patients with unilateral pontine infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The main pathogenesis of recurrent pontine base infarction seems to be basilar artery branch atherothrombosis </plain></SENT>
