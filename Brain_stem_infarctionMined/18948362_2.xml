<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Previous research on cognition and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023944" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">locked-in syndrome</z:e> (LIS) is limited to single case reports, and usually reported normality of performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009241" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive disorders</z:e> in a group of LIS patients are investigated, using a specific test relying only on a yes/no response indicated by eye movements or verbally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Nine patients with LIS resulting from brainstem <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were compared with seven patients with frontal or frontotemporal lesions and 16 matching <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The test comprised 19 subtests of perception (visual and auditory recognition), oral comprehension (identity, words and sentences), written comprehension (words and sentences), orientation (in time and place), immediate and delayed memories (verbal and visuo-spatial information), calculation and problem solving, and analysis of verbal logic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: LIS patients showed significant difficulties in auditory recognition (associative level), oral comprehension of complex sentences, delayed visuospatial memory, mental calculation and problem solving </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with hemispheric lesions were more severely impaired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Single case analysis revealed that four LIS patients showed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009241" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive disorders</z:e> in at least three subtests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These disorders were not related to a specific localisation of lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Moderate and selective <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009241" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive disorders</z:e> can be observed in LIS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Systematic assessment is needed, because of their possible consequences for communication and rehabilitation protocols </plain></SENT>
