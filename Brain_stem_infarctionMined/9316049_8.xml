<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to elucidate the pattern of vascular innervation in areas of pial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002992,C1411989" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">angiomatosis</z:e> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber disease</z:e> (SWD) and eventually correlating it with the pathophysiology of the disease, namely its <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> ischemic changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We processed part of a surgical specimen resected from a 3-year-old female patient who underwent functional hemispherectomy for SWD and characterized the pattern of innervation of the malformative cortical vessels using histochemical, immunohistochemical, and ultrastructural techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Cortical vessels were observed to be supplied with numerous varicose nerve fibers containing immunoreactivity for neuropeptide tyrosine and the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi>-synthesizing enzyme, tyrosine, tyrosine hydroxylase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, no nerve fibers containing acetylcholinesterase activity and immunoreactivity for Substance P, a calcitonin gene-related <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> and vasoactive intestinal <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ultrastructural studies revealed the presence of numerous axon <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">varicosities</z:e> at the adventitial-medial border </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neuropeptide tyrosine immunoreactivity was localized in large granular vesicles in nerve <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">varicosities</z:e> that also contained numerous small granular vesicles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that nerve supplying cortical vessels in SWD are arranged in a distribution pattern similar to the one observed in human <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cortical veins and suggest that these abnormal vessels are innervated only with noradrenergic sympathetic nerve fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This represents a clear difference from the pattern of innervation observed in both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cortical arteries and veins, and is the consequence of the anatomic and functional dysangiogenic process characteristic of the affected cortical areas in SWD </plain></SENT>
