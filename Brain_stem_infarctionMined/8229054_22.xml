<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because anti-GQ1b antibody frequently occurs in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0393799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Fisher's syndrome</z:e> (FS) and there are clinical similarities between FS and BBE, we investigated anti-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28892">ganglioside</z:chebi> antibodies in sera from 3 BBE patients who had transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0002423'>long tract signs</z:hpo> in addition to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000602'>ophthalmoplegia</z:hpo> and cerebellar-like <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> in order to clarify the etiology and nosological position of BBE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>High IgG anti-GQ1b antibody titers were present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 sera samples but decreased with the clinical course of the illness </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The finding that BBE and FS shared common autoantibody suggests that autoimmune mechanism common to FS is likely in BBE, and that both conditions represent a distinct disease with a wide spectrum of symptoms that include <z:hpo ids='HP_0000602'>ophthalmoplegia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
