<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>She had undergone, for several times, gastroepiploic transplantation at 18 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>She was scheduled for lymphaticovenular anastomosis of the right limb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Preoperatively, computed tomography showed no <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in her lower limbs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We gave only general anesthesia, because of her strong <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo>, and concern of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001028'>hemangioma</z:hpo> and blood vessel malformation in epidural space </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>General anesthesia was induced with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="102166">thiopental</z:chebi>, fentanyl, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9939">vecuronium</z:chebi>, and maintained with nitrous <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi>, oxygen and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9130">sevoflurane</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
