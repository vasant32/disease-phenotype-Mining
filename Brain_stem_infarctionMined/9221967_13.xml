<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty two <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338586" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vertebral artery dissections</z:e> were defined by intra-arterial angiography and classified in two groups: group 1, nine extracranial dissections (seven patients) and group 2, 13 intracranial dissections (nine patients), involving the basilar artery in five cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Bilateral dissections were found in 38% of the population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Before angiography, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients had been investigated by continuous wave Doppler, colour coded Doppler, and transcranial Doppler </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean follow up was 44 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The two most important symptoms of both dissections (81% of patients) were unbearable pain preceding <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> within a few hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Severe ultrasonic abnormalities were present in 94% of the patients whereas specific ultrasonic signs (segmental dilation with eccentric channel) were rare (19%) in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> and brainstem <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> represented respectively 67% and 78% in intracranial versus 43% and 29% in extracranial dissections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Severe sequelae (permanent disabling motor or cerebellar deficit) were more often associated with intracranial (44%) than with extracranial dissections (14%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No recurrence of dissection and no cerebral haemorrhage were found under <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Significant factors of poor outcome (P&lt; 0.05) were the initial severity of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and the bilateral location of dissections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The combination of a pain and a progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, corroborated by ultrasonic findings, could have helped to recognise most of these types of dissections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Intracranial dissections have a poorer prognosis than extracranial dissections </plain></SENT>
