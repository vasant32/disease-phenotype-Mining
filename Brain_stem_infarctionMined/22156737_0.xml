<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Data were retrospectively reviewed for 655 consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> noncardioembolic infarction who were admitted to our hospital from January 2004 to August 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients were divided into first-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (n = 592) and recurrent-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (n = 63) groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> infarcted lesions were explored on MRI, and clinical background factors including age, sex, smoking, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (DM) were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The frequency of BSI in the recurrent-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> group was significantly higher than that in first-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients (30.2 vs. 14.9%, p = 0.0033) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No other clinical background factors differed between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only the frequency of DM differed significantly among four subgroups formed based on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrence and BSI (p &lt; 0.0001): DM was present in 63.2% of recurrent-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with BSI, 54.5% of first-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with BSI, 27.4% of first-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients without BSI, and 20.5% of recurrent-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients without BSI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the brainstem is at high risk for recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> in patients with DM </plain></SENT>
