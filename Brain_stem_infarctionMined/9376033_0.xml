<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: As causal therapy of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039445" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Rendu-Osler-Weber syndrome</z:e> is not yet possible, there are many different therapeutical approaches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It seemed expedient to investigate the efficacy of super-selective angiography in treating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039445" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Rendu-Osler-Weber syndrome</z:e> after this technique proved effective in other therapeutic settings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This method is known to be efficient in controlling <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Between March 1993 and September 1995, eight patients with an average age of 57 years were treated by super-selective intraarterial embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases <z:hpo ids='HP_0000421'>epistaxis</z:hpo> occurred on both sides </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Unilateral embolization was performed in ten cases and bilateral embolization in five cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In two of three patients with nasal packing the embolization permitted removal of the packing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless <z:hpo ids='HP_0000421'>nosebleeds</z:hpo> reoccurred on an average of 3.5 days after therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two of eight patients showed long-term improvement after therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>They suffered fewer <z:hpo ids='HP_0000421'>nosebleeds</z:hpo> than before </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Complications included one patient who suffered from partial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> after embolization, which lasted 1.5 hours and was completely reversible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Another patient died because of pulmonic <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> caused by manifestation of the disease in this organ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Often patients complained of facial pain or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> which occasionally lasted for a few weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Endovasal embolization obviously is an alternative to artery ligation in emergency cases whereas the long-term success is currently impaired by formation of new anastomoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Further development of this technique is necessary </plain></SENT>
