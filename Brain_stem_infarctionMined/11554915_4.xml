<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The target was a medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF) lesion, which was evident from ipsilateral internuclear <z:hpo ids='HP_0000602'>ophthalmoplegia</z:hpo> (INO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sixteen patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> unilateral INO and an isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> brain stem lesion in T2- and EPI-diffusion weighted MRI within 2 days after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The MRI slice direction was parallel and perpendicular to a slice selection of a stereotactic anatomical atlas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The individual slices were normalized and projected in the digitalized atlas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The eye <z:hpo ids='HP_0100022'>movement disorder</z:hpo> was monitored by electro-oculography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with clinical or subclinical electro-oculographically documented INO and MRI proven <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain stem infarction</z:e> the lesion covered or at least partially overlapped the ipsilateral MLF at one or more atlas levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that digital post-processing MRI with normalizing and projecting brain stem lesions in an anatomical atlas is a reliable method to demonstrate the anatomical structures involved by the lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Combined with electrophysiological brain stem testing, this method may be a useful tool to identify incompletely understood pathways mediating brain stem reflexes or the generators of evoked potentials </plain></SENT>
