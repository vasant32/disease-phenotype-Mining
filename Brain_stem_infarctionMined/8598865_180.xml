<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Several surgical procedures to treat <z:hpo ids='HP_0100661'>trigeminal neuralgia</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0100661'>tic douloureux</z:hpo>) are available, but most reports provide only short-term follow-up information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We describe the long-term results of surgery in 1185 patients who underwent microvascular decompression of the trigeminal nerve for medically intractable <z:hpo ids='HP_0100661'>trigeminal neuralgia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The outcome of the procedure was assessed prospectively with annual questionnaires </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 1185 patients who underwent microvascular decompression during the 20-year study period, 1155 were followed for 1 year or more after the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up period was 6.2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Most postoperative recurrences of tic took place in the first two years after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirty percent of the patients had recurrences of tic during the study period, and 11 percent underwent second operations for the recurrences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ten years after surgery, 70 percent of the patients (as determined by Kaplan-Meier analysis) had excellent final results-that is, they were free of pain without medication for tic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An additional 4 percent had occasional pain that did not require long-term medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ten years after the procedure, the annual rate of the recurrence of tic was less than 1 percent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Female sex, symptoms lasting more than eight years, venous compression of the trigeminal-root entry zone, and the lack of immediate postoperative cessation of tic were significant predictors of eventual recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Having undergone a previous ablative procedure did not lessen a patient's likelihood of having a cessation of tic after microvascular decompression, but the rates of burning and aching facial pain, as reported on the last follow-up questionnaire, were higher if a trigeminal-ganglion lesion had been created with radiofrequency current before microvascular decompression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Major complications included two <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> shortly after the operation (0.2 percent) and one <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain-stem infarction</z:e> (0.1 percent) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Sixteen patients (1 percent) had ipsilateral hearing loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Microvascular decompression is a safe and effective treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100661'>trigeminal neuralgia</z:hpo>, with a high rate of long-term success </plain></SENT>
