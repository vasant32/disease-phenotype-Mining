<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this report was to describe the anesthesia of a patient with this syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: A 25 years old male patient underwent surgical correction of an orbital fracture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>He had the triad of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004406'>recurrent epistaxis</z:hpo>, family history and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001009'>telangiectasia</z:hpo>, and had been diagnosed with HHT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pulmonary, brain, or gastrointestinal tract vascular malformations were not detected in the preoperative investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patient underwent total venous anesthesia one hour after the administration of an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48675">antifibrinolytic drug</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>Bleeding</z:mp> was considered <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> for this type of surgery, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948268" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemodynamic instability</z:e> or the need of perioperative blood transfusion was not detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patient was extubated in the operating room; he was transferred to the room after 60 minutes and discharged from the hospital after 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Hereditary hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001009'>telangiectasia</z:hpo> is an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> disorder that leads to mucocutaneous and visceral <z:mp ids='MP_0001614'>vascular dysplasia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Perioperative blood loss can be greater than expected in patients with this syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Since <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> does not result from a defect in the coagulation cascade but from the surgical exposure of malformed vascular structures, perioperative conduct includes the use of antifibrinolytics, adequate homeostasis, and induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> in the absence of contraindications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Preanesthetic evaluation should include the search for brain, lung, and gastrointestinal vascular malformation </plain></SENT>
