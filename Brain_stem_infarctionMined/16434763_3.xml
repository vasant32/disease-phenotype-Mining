<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report the development of a large ischemic brainstem <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, resulting from occlusion of the basilar artery during anterior cervical discectomy, in a patient without previous neurological deficit, or signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042568" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vertebrobasilar insufficiency</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL FEATURES: A 55-yr-old, diabetic and hypertensive male who developed a cervical spine <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, underwent surgery for anterior discectomy at C5-C6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During the 2.5-hr long procedure the patient was lying supine with his neck hyperextended </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Except for a temporary reduction in systolic blood pressure, the intraoperative course was uneventful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At the end of surgery the patient remained unconscious with flaccid <z:hpo ids='HP_0003470'>paralysis</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> extremities, fixed pinpoint pupils, low respiratory rate, and no response to painful stimuli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="7459">Naloxone</z:chebi> administration did not improve the clinical picture, while brain computed tomography showed a large brainstem and cerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, implicating basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patient died five days later from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Intraoperative surgical manipulation with a severely inflamed vertebral system, as well as prolonged neck hyperextension occluding the blood flow of vertebrobasilar arteries might have contributed to fatal brainstem <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in this patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Neck surgery carries a potential risk for posterior circulation <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and this report heightens awareness of this rare, but serious complication </plain></SENT>
