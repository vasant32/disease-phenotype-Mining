<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE AND IMPORTANCE: Recent technological advances have provided clinicians with stents that can be navigated throughout the tortuous proximal vessels of the posterior intracranial circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There have been few reports of fusiform and wide-necked <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> treated with stents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of the known risks involved in stent placement in the intracranial circulation, delayed stent <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> has not been well described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 34-year-old man who experienced the sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of a severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> with increasing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001254'>lethargy</z:hpo> was found on computed tomographic imaging to have a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Angiography revealed a left vertebral artery fusiform <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> that incorporated the posteroinferior cerebellar artery origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: A low-porosity Magic Wallstent (Boston Scientific, Natick, MA) was placed in the left vertebral artery across the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and the origin of the posteroinferior cerebellar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Angiography performed 9 days later revealed significant reduction in filling of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patient returned 3 months after stent placement with severe neurological deterioration from a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brainstem infarction</z:e> caused by complete thrombotic occlusion of the left vertebral artery at the stented segment of the vessel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Stenting of fusiform <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> has provided an alternative to surgical clipping or parent vessel reconstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>With the increasing frequency of intracranial stent placement for various cerebrovascular disease entities, we must become aware of potential complications associated with these procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Such awareness may influence decision-making processes regarding treatment and follow-up care </plain></SENT>
