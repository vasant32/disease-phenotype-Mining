<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Limited information is available on clinical characteristics, etiology, and prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>High-resolution neuroimaging has a major role in elucidating the underlying <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this systematic review was to analyze the clinical presentations, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> mechanisms, and outcomes in patients with bilateral MMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We performed a systematic review of the literature from 1992-2011 that reported on clinical presentations, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> mechanism, and/or outcomes in patients with magnetic resonance imaging-proven bilateral MMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Medline, EMBASE, and Web of Science Scholars Portal were searched without language restriction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two reviewers independently assessed identified studies to determine eligibility, validity, and quality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome was inpatient mortality; a secondary outcome was case fatality at 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We identified 138 articles from Medline, EMBASE, and Scholars Portal including the MeSH terms "<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brainstem infarction</z:e>," "medulla," and "bilateral." Twenty-nine articles met our inclusion criteria, including a total of 38 cases with bilateral MMI, and included in our study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These 38 patients had a mean age of 62.2 years and were predominately male (74.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The most common clinical presentations were motor <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> in 78.4%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001260'>dysarthria</z:hpo> in 48.6%, and hypoglossal palsy in 40.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The most common vascular pathology was vertebral artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, in 38.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The clinical outcome was poor (mortality, 23.8%; dependency, 61.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Bilateral medial medullary infarction is a rare <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Clinical presentations were mostly rostral medullary lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Large-artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and branch disease were the most common <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The clinical outcome was usually poor </plain></SENT>
