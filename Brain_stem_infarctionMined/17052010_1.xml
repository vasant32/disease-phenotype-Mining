<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Steroid was administered on suspicion of idiopathic sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0000365'>deafness</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the initial symptoms were deteriorated approximately 2 weeks later </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In patients with risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo>, cerebrovascular disorder should be taken into consideration even if idiopathic sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0000365'>deafness</z:hpo> may be suspected clinically </plain></SENT>
