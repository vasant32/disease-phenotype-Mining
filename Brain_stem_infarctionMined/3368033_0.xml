<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Based on our experience, we have examined the advantages and disadvantages of these techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 34 patients with clinically and angiographically diagnosed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042568" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vertebro-basilar insufficiency</z:e>, the reconstructive vascular surgery to the posterior circulation was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Preoperatively, 24 had vertebro-basilar <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo>, 2 had <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RIND</z:e>, 3 had progressing symptoms and 5 had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain stem infarctions</z:e> verified by persistent deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the 18 patients with intracranial vertebro-basilar occlusive lesions, the bypass were done to the proximal posterior inferior cerebellar artery in 7 cases, proximal superior cerebellar artery in 9 cases, posterior cerebral artery in one and anterior inferior cerebellar artery in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the 16 patients with extracranial occlusive lesions of vertebral artery, endarterectomy or subclavian-vertebral transposition was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With the exception of one of the progressing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> cases, in which the surgery was ultimately too late, there were no cases in which neurological symptoms become aggravated following operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patency was 94% (32/34) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In light of these findings, the following conclusions concerning the operative indication and the selection of the technique have been drawn </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In cases with occlusive lesions of basilar artery, the first choice should be bypass to the proximal superior cerebellar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In cases with occlusive lesions of vertebral artery, bypass to the posterior inferior cerebellar or superior cerebellar or anterior inferior cerebellar artery should be performed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
