<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate regional and remote diaschisis of inferior brain stem or cerebellar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in 25 patients presenting with relatively limited lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients presented with medullary, pontine or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0236073" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebellar infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Lesions were evaluated on MRI (0.5 T) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was assessed by means of SPECT, after injection of 9rmTc-hexamethyl propyleneamine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25750">oxime</z:chebi> (HMPAO) and, when possible, inhalation of 133Xe in the same session </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For each method, asymmetry indices (Als), comparing contralateral to ipsilateral rCBF values, were calculated in four areas of each cerebral hemisphere and in the cerebellum and later compared with values obtained in healthy subjects (P = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Higher rCBF values were observed in the contralateral cerebellum in 2 of 7 patients with selective lateral medullary lesions, and cerebellar Als were significantly increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When a cerebellar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> was associated with a lateral medullary lesion, the cerebellar and contralateral hemispheric asymmetries were more severe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Unilateral paramedian pontine <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> had more frequent consequences on the cerebellum (2 of 3 cases), with rCBF or tracer uptake being reduced in the ipsilateral or the contralateral lobe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Inverse cerebral hemispheric asymmetry could then be observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Bilateral pontine lesions were difficult to evaluate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Using 99mTc-HMPAO, discrete cerebellar asymmetry was observed in 3 of 6 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Pure cerebellar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in the posterior inferior cerebellar artery territory were always associated with a severe ipsilateral flow drop in the cerebellum, and contralateral hemispheric diaschisis was frequent (3 of 4 patients), predominating in the frontotemporal cortex and subcortical structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This was also more obvious using 99mTC-HMPAO than 133Xe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Variance analysis showed that hemispheric diaschisis was more severe in mixed brain stem and cerebellar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> than in pure cerebellar or brain stem lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, cerebellar and hemispheric AI values were not correlated with measurements of clinical deficits, disability or handicap </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Unilateral and limited inferior brain stem lesions can have ipsi- or contralateral consequences on the cerebellum and cerebral hemispheres rCBF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>These remote effects are related to lesions of the main pathways joining these structures, resulting in deactivation and, in some cases, overactivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Contrary to what has been suggested, consequences on cerebral hemispheres are more severe in mixed cerebellar and brain stem <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> than in pure <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0742035" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebellar lesions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
