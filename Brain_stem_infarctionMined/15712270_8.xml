<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hepatic manifestation is seen in about 8 to 30 % of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The molecular basis for liver involvement is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We screened the two known HHT disease loci, the ALK1 (ACVRL1) and ENG genes, for mutations in a clinically well-characterized group of HHT patients with or without liver involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the ALK1 gene were detected in eight out of 10 HHT patients with hepatic manifestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among nine HHT patients without liver involvement, four had mutations in the ALK1, and three in the ENG genes, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In one patient with hepatic manifestation a mutation was detected in both the ALK1 and ENG genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No mutation could be detected in two patients with liver involvement and, likewise, in two patients without hepatic manifestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In this study, we have identified five novel ALK1 and one ENG disease-causing mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that hepatic manifestation in HHT patients is associated with mutations in the ALK1 gene, but rarely with ENG mutations </plain></SENT>
