<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: To determine the role of small vertebrobasilar artery (SVBA) in patients with posterior circulation <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (PCS), we evaluated the ischemic patterns, collateral features, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> mechanisms in PCS patients with SVBA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ischemic findings on magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) imaging were correlated with 3D time-of-flight/contrast-enhanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography and/or catheter angiography in 18 patients (mean age, 68.0+/-11.8 years; 9 males) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SVBA (lumen diameter of &lt;3 mm) was compared with stenotic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-sized VBA (NVBA) in 14 PCS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ischemic lesions were predominantly observed in the cerebellum and/or medulla (vertebral artery (VA) territory) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects had fetal posterior circulation (FPC) from the internal carotid artery to the posterior cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sixteen patients (88.9%) had distal or diffuse VA stenosis/occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 14 patients (77.8%), long circumferential artery (LCA) was prominently observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In atherothrombotic patients, infratentorial PCS might occur following artery-to-artery embolism from the low-flowed or stenotic VA to LCA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ischemic patterns between subjects with and without VA disease were almost similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>As the degree of VA disease increased, the frequency of LCA prominence showed an increased tendency (P=0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Relatively small, scattered <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were observed in patients with SVBA than in those with stenotic NVBA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: FPC does not protect against infratentorial PCS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Regardless of extensive arterial lesions, relatively small <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> may be due to previously established collaterals from the LCA, which could compensate for the defects in the infratentorial area </plain></SENT>
