<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Clinical and MRI investigations were carried out on 27 patients with acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0012043'>pendular nystagmus</z:hpo> in an attempt to delineate possible sites of lesions responsible for <z:hpo ids='HP_0012043'>pendular nystagmus</z:hpo> and mechanisms underlying the frequent ocular disconjugacy of this <z:hpo ids='HP_0000639'>nystagmus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aetiologies were multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> (n = 21), brainstem <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (n = 3) and other neurological conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In at least 59% of the patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0012043'>pendular nystagmus</z:hpo> appeared &gt; 1 year after the first symptom of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients MRIs were characterized by multiple areas of abnormal signal and were analysed statistically to identify areas where lesions overlapped significantly between patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Statistically significant overlap occurred in areas containing the red nucleus, the central tegmental tract, the medial vestibular nucleus and the inferior olive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0007811'>horizontal pendular nystagmus</z:hpo> showed predominantly pontine lesions whereas patients with torsional <z:hpo ids='HP_0012043'>pendular nystagmus</z:hpo> showed predominantly medullary involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0000639'>nystagmus</z:hpo> was conjugate in 15 patients and disconjugate in amplitude or direction in 12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Internuclear <z:hpo ids='HP_0000602'>ophthalmoplegia</z:hpo> or asymmetrical visual acuity occurred in similar proportions in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with conjugate <z:hpo ids='HP_0012043'>pendular nystagmus</z:hpo> had a higher incidence of symmetrical, "mirror image' lesions on MRI than patients with disconjugate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000639'>nystagmus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The abundance of abnormal MRI signals in our sample suggests that large or multiple structural lesions may be required to elicit <z:hpo ids='HP_0012043'>pendular nystagmus</z:hpo>, predominantly in the pons but also in the midbrain and medulla </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The involvement of structures projecting to the inferior olive supports the hypothesis that oscillatory properties of olivary neurons causes the rhythm of <z:hpo ids='HP_0012043'>pendular nystagmus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The delay observed between the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the underlying disease and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0012043'>pendular nystagmus</z:hpo> supports a mechanism operating via neural deafferentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Disconjugancies in <z:hpo ids='HP_0012043'>pendular nystagmus</z:hpo> cannot be explained on the basis of the associated internuclear <z:hpo ids='HP_0000602'>ophthalmoplegias</z:hpo> nor on the basis of asymmetrical visual acuity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The association between symmetrical MRI lesions and conjugate <z:hpo ids='HP_0000639'>nystagmus</z:hpo> suggests that asymmetrical damage to brainstem structures concerned with binocular alignment may underlie disconjugate <z:hpo ids='HP_0012043'>pendular nystagmus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
