<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent studies of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and cerebral metabolism in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS)</z:e> have demonstrated a regional decrease of CBF and metabolism in the affected hemisphere, which may reflect the neurological status of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, in the present study, we use stable <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi> computed tomography (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi>-CT) and/or (99m)<z:chebi fb="1" ids="33353">technetium</z:chebi> hexamethylprophylene <z:chebi fb="39" ids="32952">amine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25750">oxime</z:chebi> ((99mTc)HMPAO) single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography (SPECT) to determine whether the degree of cerebral hemodynamic disturbance correlates with the severity of motor impairment in 5 children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found that 5 patients had great variation in clinical progression and outcome, but <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging investigations <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> revealed extensive but stable abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>rCBF, assessed by stable <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi>-CT and/or (99mTc)HMPAO-SPECT, showed perfusion defect in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi>-CT disclosed reduction of rCBF and cerebrovascular reactivity in patients with severe motor <z:hpo ids='HP_0003470'>paralysis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The total CBF and rCBF detected by <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi>-CT were improved after clinical status was stabilized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the motor function impairment in patients with SWS appeared to better correlate with the degree of rCBF impairment than with the abnormalities in conventional neuroimaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the quantitative CBF study is one of the diagnostic modality of choice in evaluating the neurological status in patients with SWS </plain></SENT>
