<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present, a 14-year-old girl, a case of post-hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> with multiple revisions of ventriculo-peritoneal (V-P) and ventriculo-atrial (V-A) shunts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>She developed malfunctioned V-S shunt, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302598" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ventriculitis</z:e> that was complicated with massive cerebellar and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain stem infarction</z:e> and the patient died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To avoid malfunction, a cardiac catheter with side slits should be used, magnetic resonance angiography is recommended before shunt placement to check the patency of the sinus, and the pressure in the superior sagittal sinus should be measured at the time of surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In patients with problematic distal catheters, direct placement of the catheter into the right atrium using thoracoscope could be an alternative to gall bladder or ureter shunts </plain></SENT>
