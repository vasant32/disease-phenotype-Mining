<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We recruited 75 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> IS with measurements of autonomic cardiac function, including heart rate variability (HRV) and associated parameters, and compared them with 81 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of the 75 patients, 28 had right hemispheric infarctions (RH), 29 had left hemispheric infarctions (LH), and 18 had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brainstem infarctions</z:e> (BS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A comparison of HRV in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and in control subjects showed significant differences between IS subgroups and controls in low frequency (LF), high frequency (HF), normalized LF, normalized HF, and LF/HF ranges </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A post-hoc comparison identified significant differences between patients with IS with BS infarctions and the control group in LF, HF, and LF/HF ranges </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>BS infarction may cause a much greater increase in sympathetic modulation and reduced vagal activity compared to RH or LH infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our findings provide evidence that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> IS causes significant damage to the cardiovascular autonomic system, manifesting as abnormalities of HRV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>BS <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> might correlate with a significant reduction in parasympathetic and an increase in sympathetic influence on HRV </plain></SENT>
