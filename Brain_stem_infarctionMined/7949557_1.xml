<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a review of admission records of 750 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cerebrovascular disease from July 1991 to June 1993, at Saint Louis University Hospital, 20 patients were identified with clinical signs of nonlacunar, vertebrobasilar distribution infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eight of these had pontomesencephalic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Their neuroimaging studies and medical records were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> clinical signs of pontomesencephalic infarction were found to have a hyperdense basilar artery on CT scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The scans of 2 patients were excluded because of dolichoectasia; in the other 2 patients, the basilar artery appeared <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> on the CT scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The hyperdense basilar artery was detected within the early hours of neurological symptoms and often was the only detectable abnormality on the scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 3 patients extensive brainstem <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> subsequently developed and they died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Basilar artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was confirmed by pathological study in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the fourth patient basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and a large pontine <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> were evident by magnetic resonance imaging and angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A hyperdense basilar artery is a common feature on CT scans of patients presenting with an early clinical diagnosis of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Untreated, the hyperintense basilar artery often portends a poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Its ready recognition should guide further interventional studies and treatment </plain></SENT>
