<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The surgical management of occlusive <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> caused by massive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0236073" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebellar infarction</z:e> remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The procedures that are more commonly used to avoid progressive neurological deterioration are based on transient external ventricular drainage or the placement of permanent shunt systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, this is the first report regarding using endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) in patients with an occlusive <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> caused by cerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report our experience of 10 reviewed cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between 1997 and 2004, 10 patients with a resulting <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> caused by a space-occupying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0236073" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebellar infarction</z:e> were managed with ETV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Scale score on admission, cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and computed tomographic signs, including the ischemic vascular territory involved and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo>, were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical outcome was evaluated using the Glasgow Outcome Scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, there was a mean interval of 4 days from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of deterioration of consciousness to operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Scale score on admission was 11.2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In nine patients, ETV was the initial procedure of ventricular drainage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One patient was primarily treated with an external ventricular drainage, but the device dislocated and ETV was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In one patient, an external ventricular drainage became necessary 7 days after the initial ETV because of a malfunction of the stoma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>One patient showed a progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> 2 days after ETV, and suboccipital decompression was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Eight successfully treated patients demonstrated an improvement in the level of consciousness after ETV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Mean Glasgow Outcome Scale score on discharge of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients was 3.4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Occlusive <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> caused by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0236073" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebellar infarction</z:e> is infrequent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>When occlusive <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> is observed, ETV can be used successfully with minimal risks, especially with avoidance of a higher rate of infectious complications caused by external drainage systems </plain></SENT>
