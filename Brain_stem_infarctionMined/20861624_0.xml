<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the frequency and clinical profiles of patients with medial medullary infarction (MMI) identified by diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We assessed the frequency, radiological findings, etiology and clinical features of MMI detected by DWI from our single-center registry of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischemic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty patients (1.5% of 2,014 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>) had MMI, including isolated unilateral MMI in 26 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Lesions were located by DWI in the rostral medulla of 25 patients (83%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Culprit <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> that were undetectable by DWI in 6 (38%) of 16 patients who were assessed within 24 h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> were later confirmed as MMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The major etiological mechanism was small <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (SAO; 19 patients) and the median initial National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale score was 4 (interquartile range: 3-4.75) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most frequent symptom was contralateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> (27 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>None of the patients fulfilled the classical Dejerine Triad </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two patients (73%) had a modified Rankin Scale score of â‰¤2 at 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A patient developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> within 3 months; none developed recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Rostral medullary infarction with mild neurological deficits resulting from SAO is relatively frequent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Because emergency DWI within 24 h could not detect MMI in one third of the patients, this type of infarction could be misdiagnosed as capsular/pontine lacunae or other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112108" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurological disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
