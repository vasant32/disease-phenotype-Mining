<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This manuscript describes two different strategies to progress from the clinical assessment of patients to the identification of disease-causing mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the first disease, recognition of a metabolic abnormality allowed direct molecular analysis of the causal gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, localization of the second disease gene by linkage analysis was critical to implicate a gene with a previously unsuspected disease role </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two sisters with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035204" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">respiratory disease</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002719'>recurrent infections</z:hpo> were identified as the first cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003581'>adult onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> due to <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> deaminase deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>Autosomal recessive inheritance</z:hpo> of two mutations in the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> deaminase gene was demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Enzyme replacement therapy improved the patients' immunological and clinical status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Individuals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006548'>pulmonary arteriovenous malformations</z:hpo> were used to identify families with hereditary haemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001009'>telangiectasia</z:hpo> (HHT, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039445" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Rendu-Osler-Weber Syndrome</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Linkage studies mapped the HHT disease gene in some families to chromosome 9, and demonstrated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>genetic heterogeneity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The chromosome 9 disease interval was refined, and several candidate genes were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Following the first description of disease-segregating mutations, a complete analysis of the endoglin gene (which encodes an endothelial cell transforming growth factor-beta receptor) identified seven novel mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Two mutations did not produce mutant <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, and disease severity was comparable between families, indicating that HHT results from stoichiometric insufficiency of endoglin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Each study has implications extending beyond the relatively <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0678236" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rare disease</z:e> analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi>-deaminase-deficient patients highlight a treatable cause of HIV-negative CD4+ <z:hpo ids='HP_0001888'>lymphopenia</z:hpo> in adults, perhaps accounting for further cases of 'non-HIV <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The HHT studies have illuminated a novel area of vascular pathophysiology, with potential relevance to further <z:mp ids='MP_0002054'>disease states</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
