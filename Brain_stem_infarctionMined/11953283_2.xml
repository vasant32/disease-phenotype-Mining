<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to analyse the clinical symptomatology in patients with the classical signs of brainstem <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> MRI results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Frequencies of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>-positive and negative infarctions should be analysed according to their location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a series of 30 consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> clinical symptoms of ischemic brainstem lesions and persistence of the symptomatology for more than 10 days, 8 patients had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In these patients the location of the lesion was established by clinical and electrophysiological criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The lesions in the 8 patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> MRI were situated in medulla oblongata (n=3), in pons (n = 2), and in midbrain (n = 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In each of these patients the clinical symptoms corresponded to one of the classical alternating syndromes, which are pathognomic for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brainstem infarctions</z:e> (1 Wallenberg, 1 Avellis, 1 Jackson, 2 Millard-Gubler, and 3 Weber) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The clinical course of the infarctions with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> MRI was favourable, the symptoms disappeared within few weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our study proved that the clinical diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brainstem infarction</z:e>, particularly in lesions of midbrain and caudal tegmentum pontis, can not be excluded by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> MRI </plain></SENT>
