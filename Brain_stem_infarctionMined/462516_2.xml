<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>EEG was monitored at bilateral scalp sites outside the operative field during hypotensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> surgery in 21 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mean arterial blood pressure at axillary level was 50-60 mm Hg (average 55 mm) for 1.9-5.3 hours (average 3.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four new deficits were noted immediately post-operatively, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> related to the operated site: these were attributable to intra-operative rupture with forced vascular clipping, vasospasm, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In no instance was <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> solely responsible for a new deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>EEG showed persistent slowing in relation to surgery in only 1 patient, where aneurysmal rupture led to severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo>, forced clipping of 1 posterior cerebral artery, and subsequent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain stem infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the 3 other patients with fresh focal postoperative deficits, no persistent intraoperative EEG changes were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>EEG monitoring did not detect <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in these 3 patients because 1) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> was moderate and did not per se cause new deficit, and 2) EEG electrodes did not survey the area at maximal risk, namely the operative field </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>EEG scalp electrodes near but outside the operative site do not seem useful for monitoring cerebral function in the region of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Epidural or cortical electrodes in the operative field may prove to be more useful </plain></SENT>
