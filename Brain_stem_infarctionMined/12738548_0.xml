<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To investigate the cause of the secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> in a case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome</z:e> by histopathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CASE: A 10-year-old boy with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> in the right eye was studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Trabeculectomy was performed because of uncontrolled intraocular pressure, and the trabeculectomy specimen was examined histologically by both light and electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Histological examination of the trabeculectomy specimen showed that the ciliary muscle was dislocated anteriorly, and the Schlemm canal was not present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The spaces in the juxtacanalicular connective tissue (JCT) were replaced by vascular structures and connective tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were two kinds of vascular structures: in one, the endothelium was surrounded by pericytes; and in the other, the endothelium was not surrounded by pericytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Developmental abnormalities of the Schlemm canal and the JCT may have caused the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest that the developmental abnormalities of both the mesoderm and the neural crest might be involved in the pathogenesis of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> in cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
