<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS)</z:e> is a neurocutaneous disorder with vascular malformations of the skin, brain, and eye </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SWS results in ischemic brain injury, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, and neurologic deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that a decrease in quantitative EEG (qEEG) power, on the affected side, correlates with clinical severity in subjects with SWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fourteen subjects had 16-channel scalp EEG recordings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data were analyzed using fast Fourier transform and calculation of power asymmetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Blinded investigators assigned scores for clinical neurological status and qualitative assessment of MRI and EEG asymmetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The majority of subjects demonstrated lower total power on the affected side, usually involving <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha, and beta) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>qEEG asymmetry correlated strongly with neurologic clinical severity scores and MRI asymmetry scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>qEEG data generally agreed with the MRI evidence of regional brain involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In MRI-qEEG comparisons that did not agree, decreased power on qEEG in a brain region not affected on MRI was more likely to occur in subjects with more severe neurologic deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: qEEG provides an objective measure of EEG asymmetry that correlates with clinical status and brain asymmetry seen on MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings support the conclusion that qEEG reflects the degree and extent of brain involvement and dysfunction in SWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>qEEG may potentially be a useful tool for early diagnosis and monitoring of disease progression in SWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>qEEG may prove useful, in severely affected individuals with SWS, for determining regions of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0262405" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain dysfunction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
