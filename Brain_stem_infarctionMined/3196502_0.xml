<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have already developed a model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain stem ischemia</z:e> by occluding the perforators of the posterior cerebral arteries of the dog </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The ischemic lesions locates mainly in the ventral side of the midbrain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using this model, we assessed brain stem function by brain stem auditory evoked potential (BAEP), surface- and depth-recorded (in medial lemniscus) short latency somatosensory evoked potential (SSEP), blink reflex (BR) and electroencephalography (EEG), and investigated the correlation between the electrophysiological abnormalities and the lesion in the brain stem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The studies were performed for 6 hours after perforator occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, depth-recorded SSEP and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) were measured under induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> by withdrawal of arterial blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>BAEP did not change in 13 of 16 animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Surface-recorded SSEP remained unchanged in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 6 animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results are probably due to the fact that the lesion does not involve the auditory and somatosensory pathways and the accompanying events such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> does not affect the both pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Depth-recorded SSEP remained unchanged after occlusion and did not disappear even when rCBF fell below 10 ml/100 g/min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It may be suggested that the threshold for electrical failure in the brain stem is much lower than that in the cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In BR, R1 did not change but ipsilateral R2 became nearly invisible immediately after perforator occlusion in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The fact that the ischemic lesion did not involve the pons and disturbed reticular formation in the midbrain may probably account for the remaining of R1 and the disappearance of ipsilateral R2.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
