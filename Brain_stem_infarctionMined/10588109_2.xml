<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The characteristics of hypoperfusion in the supratentorial region of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain stem infarction</z:e> are unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the relationships between the presence of hypoperfusion and the location, number, and size of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> with <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi> contrast-enhanced CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred five patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain stem infarction</z:e> detected by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging underwent <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi> contrast-enhanced CT to measure the regional CBF (rCBF) in the frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital regions and in the putamen and thalamus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A decrease of more than 10% from the mean rCBF value for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals was considered to indicate hypoperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-six patients had supratentorial hypoperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean rCBF values (measured in mL/100 g/minute) were as follows: frontal region, 36.2 +/- 5.1 (-14.8%, n = 28); parietal region, 42.3 +/- 4.7 (-19.1%, n = 29); temporal region, 41.5 +/- 2.8 (-12.6%, n = 12); and thalamus, 50.1 +/- 3.2 (-19.6%, n = 7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Supratentorial hypoperfusion was associated with pontine infarction in 33 patients (upper pons in 15, middle pons in 18, and lower pons in seven), midbrain infarction in two, and medulla infarction in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three patients had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> that were larger than 5 mm, and 11 had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> that were 2 to 5 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only two had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> that were smaller than 2 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Seven patients each had one <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, 13 each had two, and 16 each had three </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Supratentorial hypoperfusion was associated with larger <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, with more <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, and with pontine infarction </plain></SENT>
