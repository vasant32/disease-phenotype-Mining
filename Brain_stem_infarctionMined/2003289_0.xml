<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To investigate the effects of basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, we surgically exposed and coagulated the basilar artery in 25 rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> at any single point between the foramen magnum and the circle of Willis in 11 rats did not produce histologically detectable <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in the brain at 12-24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two-point occlusions of the basilar artery in 12 rats produced variable <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> between the occlusion sites but no ischemic lesions elsewhere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After either single- or double-point occlusions, the proximal basilar artery refilled within 2-3 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When the basilar artery was occluded above and below the origins of the anterior inferior cerebellar arteries, the artery segments between the occlusion points initially collapsed but refilled within 2-3 minutes in two rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusions</z:mp> invariably suppressed cortical somatosensory evoked potentials by greater than 50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Regardless of whether a brain stem <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> developed, somatosensory evoked potential amplitudes recovered to greater than baseline levels by 4 hours in seven of 17 rats and returned to baseline levels by 24 hours in every rat tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the occluded basilar artery receives extensive retrograde collateral blood flow and that somatosensory evoked potentials are exquisitely sensitive to basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> but are insensitive to whether brain stem <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> develop </plain></SENT>
