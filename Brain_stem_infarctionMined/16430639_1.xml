<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three men (mean age 33 years) with vasogenic ED secondary to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">KTS</z:e> underwent venous ligation surgery of the affected veins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These men had tried various treatments for their ED, including phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors and intracavernosal injection therapy, with little success </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was abnormal penile venous drainage in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three men, probably associated with congenital vascular malformation from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">KTS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After venous ligation the men were followed for 5 years and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> reported good quality erections satisfactory for sexual intercourse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: ED in men with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">KTS</z:e> may be due to venous drainage anomalies and if confirmed, venous ligation surgery should be performed as this gives the best chance of a complete resolution </plain></SENT>
