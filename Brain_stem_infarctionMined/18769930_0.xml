<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine the electrophysiological characteristics of SWS, we evaluated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> discharges using intracranial electrocorticography (ECoG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE SUMMARY: We report a 1-year and 3-month-old boy diagnosed with SWS whose psychomotor development was impaired despite good control of his <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> with several <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">antiepileptic</z:chebi> drugs (AEDs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Prolonged video ECoG monitoring was performed to determine whether subclinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> had induced his <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>developmental delay</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Frequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> were detected as motionless staring and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002098'>respiratory distress</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>His <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> originated from multiple areas along the Sylvian fissure, propagated very slowly, and lasted for 10 to 30 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Left hemispherotomy was performed, and he was confirmed to be completely <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo>-free after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our findings indicate that long-lasting and barely discernible <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> may continue in patients with SWS who appear to have good control of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> with AEDs </plain></SENT>
