<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>ENG and ALK-1 are found associated with two disease subtypes designated as HHT1 and HHT2, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subtype HHT1 remains in the frame of interest of laryngology because of frequent <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> in head and neck region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHOD: The study was designed to identify a genetic background in a large family (29 individuals) with diagnosed HHT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pedigree analysis showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> pattern of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Study design comprised segregation analysis to determine locus with subsequent direct sequencing of the gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four microsatelite markers (d9s61, d9s65, d12s368, d12s347) with high frequency of heterozygosity in population study were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The results concerning heterozygosity ranged from 15% to 53% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The established differences were not sufficient enough to indicate co-segregation of the studied loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DNA sequence analysis in exon 11 of ENG gene did not reveal mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The latter result could be explained by an occurrence of mutations in other exons of ENG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The study requires continuation for gene identification and precise genotype-phenotype correlation aiming for an improvement of HHT1 therapy </plain></SENT>
