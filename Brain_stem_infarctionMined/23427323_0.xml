<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The aim of this fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET study was to determine whether the activation pattern in patients with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> unilateral central vestibular lesion (e.g., lesion of the vestibular nucleus) differs from that known in patients with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> peripheral vestibular deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twelve patients with circumscribed unilateral medullary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brainstem infarctions</z:e> (6 right, 6 left) causing <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> vestibular imbalance underwent resting-state (18)F-FDG-PET </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Regional cerebral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism was measured twice without any stimulation and with eyes closed: in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase after <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> on mean day 8 (range 4-12), and again 6 months later in 7 patients after recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Group subtraction analyses and comparisons with a dataset of 12 age-matched controls were done with Statistic Parametric Mapping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage, the pattern of signal increases differed from that in peripheral vestibular lesions: whereas signals in the infratentorial areas in the contralateral medulla and cerebellum (peduncle, vermis, hemispheres) were increased, areas at the cortical level were largely spared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Signal decreases were found in similar sites in the visual cortex bilaterally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The current data provide evidence that the lesion site significantly modifies the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism pattern in an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> vestibular lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Different compensation strategies seem to be apparent: after vestibular nucleus lesions, compensation occurs preferably in brainstem-cerebellar loops; after peripheral lesions, it occurs at the cortical level </plain></SENT>
