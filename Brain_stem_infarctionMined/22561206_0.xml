<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Reduced cerebral blood flow and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> have been well documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Less is known about ocular blood flow despite the frequent associations between altered hemodynamics and the mechanisms underlying glaucomatous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001138'>optic neuropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this research was to investigate retrobulbar hemodynamics in patients diagnosed with SWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The sample comprised 16 patients diagnosed with SWS and 16 age- and gender-matched <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four patients were diagnosed with both SWS and <z:hpo ids='HP_0012108'>primary open-angle glaucoma</z:hpo> (mean age 34.3 years; SD 26.9 years), three patients with both SWS and closed-angle <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> (mean age 23.3 years; SD 18.0 years), and nine patients with SWS and no <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> (mean age 17.2 years; SD 9.1 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Systemic blood pressure and intraocular pressure were measured to determine the mean arterial pressure and ocular perfusion pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients and subjects underwent ultrasonography of the ophthalmic artery, central <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> artery, and short posterior ciliary arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No significant difference between groups for mean arterial pressure or ocular perfusion pressure (p &gt; 0.05) was recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Participants diagnosed with SWS and <z:hpo ids='HP_0012108'>primary open-angle glaucoma</z:hpo> showed significantly reduced end-diastolic velocity (mean 0.036 m/s; SD 0.005 m/s) in their central <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> artery (p = 0.016) when compared against their age-matched <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (mean 0.054 m/s; SD 0.010 m/s) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Participants diagnosed with SWS and no <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> also showed significantly reduced end-diastolic velocity (mean 0.038 m/s; SD 0.015 m/s) in their central <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> artery (p = 0.046) when compared against their age-matched <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (mean 0.054 m/s; SD 0.014 m/s) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Retrobulbar hemodynamics appear to be altered in participants diagnosed with SWS irrespective of their diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Further research is needed to ascertain whether there are any long-term consequences of such changes to ocular <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
