<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent reports have established the feasibility of using balloon valvuloplasty to reduce left ventricular outflow tract obstruction due to a <z:mp ids='MP_0006116'>calcified aortic valve</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study summarizes experiences with this technique in 9 patients (7 women, 2 men, mean age 78 years) in whom balloon valvuloplasty was used to treat calcific <z:hpo ids='HP_0001650'>aortic stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Peak aortic valve gradient (mm Hg) decreased from 68 +/- 8 (mean +/- standard error of the mean) before valvuloplasty to 35 +/- 5 after valvuloplasty (p = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mean aortic valve gradient decreased from 57 +/- 7 before valvuloplasty to 30 +/- 5 after valvuloplasty (p = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Calculated aortic valve area increased from 0.42 +/- 0.04 to 0.81 +/- 0.06 cm2 (p = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Balloon valvuloplasty failed to diminish aortic valve obstruction in only 1 patient who, at subsequent surgery, had a congenitally <z:hpo ids='HP_0001647'>bicuspid aortic valve</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001659'>aortic regurgitation</z:hpo> was not observed in any of the 9 patients after valvuloplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One patient did have a highly focal, presumably embolic, brain stem <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> during the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Femoral arterial blood loss, related to wire-guided exchange of balloon catheters too large for a 12Fr introducer sheath, was minimized by direct arterial exposure in 8 of the 9 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, these findings confirm the efficacy of balloon valvuloplasty for the treatment of calcific <z:hpo ids='HP_0001650'>aortic stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The procedure, however, is not without hazard </plain></SENT>
