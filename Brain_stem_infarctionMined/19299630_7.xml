<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The perfusion territories of the brain-feeding arteries are difficult to assess in vivo and therefore standard cerebral perfusion territory templates are often used to determine the relation between cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and the feeding vasculature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we compared this <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> classification, using standard templates, with the individualized depiction of cerebral perfusion territories on MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The ethics committee of our institution approved the study protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 159 patients (92 male, 67 female; mean age, 58.9 years) with first-time clinical symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Diffusion-weighted imaging was used for depiction of the area of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and the perfusion territories of the left internal carotid artery, right internal carotid artery, and vertebrobasilar arteries were visualized with territorial arterial spin labeling MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> locations with respect to cerebral perfusion territories were evaluated with and without territorial arterial spin labeling MRI images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 92% of the patients, the territorial arterial spin labeling images were of diagnostic quality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One hundred thirty-six patients showed areas of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> on diffusion-weighted images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The additional information from the territorial arterial spin labeling images changed the classification in 11% of the cortical or border zone <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (6 of 56), whereas no territorial changes were observed in lacunar, periventricular, cerebellar, and brainstem <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The diagnostic information provided by perfusion territory imaging in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is valuable for the classification of cortical and border zone <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, whereas no change of the textbook-based classification was observed for other <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> types </plain></SENT>
