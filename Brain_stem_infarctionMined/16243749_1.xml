<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study reports a middle-aged man who experienced an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute onset</z:hpo> of episodic oscillatory burning pain restricted to the cheiro-oral region, who was found to have a singular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> at the left tegmental pons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A close relationship between his pain attack and an elevation of arterial blood pressure was clearly observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Blood adenohypophyseal hormones and electroencephalogram did not reveal an abnormality in the ictus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neuroimaging and clinical studies did not support involvement of the thalamus, periaqueductal gray matter, hypothalamus or regional structure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, episodic pain may be an isolated manifestation with a pontine lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A relapsing expansion of focal cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> with fluid retention may have corresponded to the oscillation of his <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0748618" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sensory deficit</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This accumulating, devastating calamity by a repetitive and paroxysmal offense after a blood-brain barrier breakdown should be cautiously reviewed </plain></SENT>
