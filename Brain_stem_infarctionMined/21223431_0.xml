<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: LEU and 2-deoxy-2[(18) F]fluoro-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4167">D-glucose</z:chebi> (FDG) PET were performed in 7 children (age: 5 months-13 years) with unilateral SWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Asymmetries of LEU uptake in the posterior brain region, underlying the <z:mp ids='MP_0002947'>angioma</z:mp> and in frontal cortex, were measured and correlated with <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> hypometabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Kinetic analysis of LEU uptake was performed in 4 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Increased LEU standard uptake value (SUV, mean: 15.1%) was found in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002947'>angioma</z:mp> region in 6 patients, and smaller increases in LEU SUV (11.5%) were seen in frontal cortex in 4 of the 6 patients, despite <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism in frontal regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>High LEU SUV was due to both increased tracer transport (3/4 patients) and high protein synthesis rates (2/4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>FDG SUV asymmetries in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002947'>angioma</z:mp> region were inversely related to LEU SUV asymmetries (r=-.83, P= .042) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Increased amino acid uptake in the <z:mp ids='MP_0002947'>angioma</z:mp> region and also in less affected frontal regions may provide a marker of pathological mechanisms contributing to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> brain damage in children with SWS </plain></SENT>
