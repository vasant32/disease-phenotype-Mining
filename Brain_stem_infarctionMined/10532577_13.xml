<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: This study was conceived to provide an insight into the spectrum of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> in the pediatric population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We also set out to compare the success of disease control and the prognosis for vision within the different diagnostic subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This is the largest single population of children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> that has been so described and compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The charts of children who were first seen between birth and age 16 years and who attended the Hospital for Sick Children with any form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> between January 1974 and January 1995 were reviewed and entered into the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Data are presented for 306 children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001087'>Congenital glaucoma</z:hpo> was the most common subtype, accounting for 38% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001087'>congenital glaucoma</z:hpo> were young, had surgery, and had more operations than any other group except those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000526'>aniridia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Goniotomy offered a cure in 47.8% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A bimodal distribution reflected their visual performance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with aphakic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo>, the next most prevalent group (20%), presented at an older age (4.5 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Surgical intervention was performed in 50% of these children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Nearly <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome</z:e> (80%) had surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The following <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> groups were associated with a poor visual outcome: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000526'>aniridia</z:hpo>, anterior segment developmental anomalies involving the cornea, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000554'>uveitis</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> other than steroid induced, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0728731" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prematurity</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0007968'>persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Steroid-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0007700'>anterior segment dysgenesis</z:hpo>, excluding <z:hpo ids='HP_0000659'>Peters anomaly</z:hpo>, had uniformly good outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The ability to control <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> in childhood and visual prognosis is highly variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Particular diagnostic categories do consistently well and some do poorly </plain></SENT>
