<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Circumferential <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, which incorporate &gt;180 degrees of the circumference of the parent vessel, present a unique therapeutic challenge, particularly in circumstances in which a deconstructive treatment strategy is not feasible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We detail a novel technique for endovascular parent vessel reconstruction with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of the prospectively maintained databases of our two institutions to identify cases in which a balloon-in-stent technique had been used to treat circumferential <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During the first stage of this technique, a stent (Neuroform [Boston Scientific, Natick, MA], Multilink Vision [Guidant, Indianapolis, IN], or Bx Velocity [Cordis, New Brunswick, NJ]) is placed across the neck of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> to achieve parent vessel reconstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During the second stage, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> coil embolization is performed with a compliant temporary occlusion balloon (Sentry [Boston Scientific, Natick, MA] or Hyperglide [Microtherapeutics, Irvine, CA]) placed within the stent to unambiguously demarcate and protect the parent vessel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In some cases, during the course of the embolization, coils project over and obscure the parent vessel in both working views </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Before each coil detachment, the protection balloon is deflated under blank fluoroscopic roadmap visualization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The absence of shifting of any portion of the coil mass during balloon deflation indicates that the introduced coil is external to the stent-reconstructed parent vessel (i.e., within the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>) and can be detached </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This process is repeated until satisfactory <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> embolization is achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After embolization, the balloon catheter may be exchanged for a stent delivery system to facilitate the placement of a second stent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seven patients underwent balloon-in-stent-assisted embolization over a 15-month period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Three were performed for internal carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, three for basilar trunk or basilar apex <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, and one for a dissecting/fusiform V4 segment vertebral artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In three cases, the presence of the inflated balloon facilitated the manipulation of the image intensifier into a position which produced a "down-the-barrel" view of the parent vessel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In the four additional cases, for anatomic reasons, this view could not be achieved and coil mass projected over the reconstructed parent vessel in both views </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Partial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> occlusion (75-90%), was achieved in five cases, and near complete (&gt;95%) occlusion was achieved in two cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Complications included two significant retroperitoneal <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematomas</z:mp> and two brainstem <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, both of which resulted in hemisensory symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The balloon-in-stent technique provides a practical and safe treatment strategy for the management of circumferential <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> that are not amenable to deconstructive embolization </plain></SENT>
