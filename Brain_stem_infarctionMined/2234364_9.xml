<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These fractures were divided pathologically into three types based upon their appearance on computed tomography: longitudinal, transverse, and oblique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms of injury were similar in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups, and the Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Scale scores at admission were comparable, regardless of fracture type, in survivors and nonsurvivors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Longitudinal fractures were associated with severe injury to the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system and with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain stem infarction</z:e>, and 4 of 6 (67%) of these patients died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transverse fractures of the clival complex were found in 6 patients, 3 of whom (50%) died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of these patients had fractures of the petrous ridge; 2 of the 3 survivors had multiple cranial nerve deficits, and one patient developed a carotid-cavernous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the 5 patients with oblique clival fractures, 2 survived (40%), both of whom had multiple <z:hpo ids='HP_0006824'>cranial nerve palsies</z:hpo>; in addition, one of these patients developed a carotid-cavernous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Using the present generation of computed tomographic scanners, fractures of the clival complex can be reliably diagnosed; they are probably more common than previously believed and can be separated into three groups based on the characteristics on computed tomographic scans and clinical findings </plain></SENT>
