<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These were localized in the midbrain in 4 cases, in the medulla in 12 cases and in the pons in 11 cases, while the remaining three patients demonstrated combined lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Symptoms were lesions of the pyramidal tract in 77% of cases, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002321'>vertigo</z:hpo> in 57% of cases, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037823,C0869217" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">speech disturbances</z:e> in 40% of cases and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002066'>gait ataxia</z:hpo> in 37% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cranial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0847483" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">nerve lesions</z:e> were evident in 87% of patients, while 33% of patients demonstrated a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002277'>Horner syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Brainstem lesions were diagnosed in 22 (73%) of patients on magnetic resonance imaging, while <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 30 patients had clinical signs suggestive of brainstem lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that neuroradiological studies can provide helpful information regarding patients with brainstem lesions, but by no means replace exact neurological examination </plain></SENT>
