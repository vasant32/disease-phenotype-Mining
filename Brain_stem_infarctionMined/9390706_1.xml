<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Gyriform or <z:chebi fb="107" ids="46670,9119">serpentine</z:chebi> calcification as revealed by computed tomography (CT) scan is rare and is a characteristic finding of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS)</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002608'>celiac disease</z:hpo> (CD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These patients had neither the facial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001052'>nevus flammeus</z:hpo> or neurological deficits characteristic of SWS, nor the gastrointestinal symptoms characteristic of CD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CD is often accompanied by cerebral occipital calcification indistinguishable from that of SWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate the presence of cerebral leptomeningeal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002992,C1411989" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">angiomatosis</z:e> (LA) by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">Gadolinium</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35739">DTPA</z:chebi>-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) but could not detect LA by either CT scanning or angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It has been reported that contrast-enhanced MRI is useful to detect LA in SWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, we found no reports of enhanced MRI in patients with SWS without facial <z:mp ids='MP_0002947'>angioma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>If future studies can demonstrate the absence of cortical enhancement by contrast-enhanced MRI in CD with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002514'>cerebral calcifications</z:hpo>, enhanced MRI would become an important tool for differentiating CD from SWS </plain></SENT>
