<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>HME is a developmental brain malformation associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e>, hemianopsia, and varying degrees of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>developmental delay</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that the relatively poor overall developmental outcome of surgically hemispherectomized HME patients as a group, compared to children undergoing hemispherectomy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002383'>encephalitis</z:hpo>, is related to dysfunction of the structurally "<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>" non-HME side and that PET would be helpful in the pre-surgical evaluation of HME patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096063" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intractable epilepsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Visual analysis of the non-HME side on PET clearly revealed evidence of cortical hypometabolism in 4 patients compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seven children underwent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One child had a <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolic pattern suggesting a cortical lamination defect in the non-HME hemisphere, bilateral independent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, and was not considered to be a surgical candidate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found a general correlation between the pattern of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> utilization in the less affected hemisphere and prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although the follow-up periods are short, it is recommended that HME children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096063" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intractable epilepsy</z:e> undergo hemispherectomy in the first year of life in order to allow maximal brain plasticity to occur; however, preoperative evaluation should also include an assessment of the integrity of the non-HME hemisphere </plain></SENT>
