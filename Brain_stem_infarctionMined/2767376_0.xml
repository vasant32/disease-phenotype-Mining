<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By 2-D approach it was possible to visualize a wide anechogenic concamerated area containing an echodense mass and continuous with the left heart cavities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pulsed Doppler interrogation at the level of the extra-cardiac cavity showed a flow signal which gave the first diagnostic evidence of a vascular lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Direct visualization of pulmonary arteriovenous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> has never before been obtained with echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This was possible in the present case due to contiguity with heart chambers and the large dimension of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Doppler examination gave the first confirmation of the vascular nature of the lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Angiography is still a mandatory pre-operative procedure but 2-D and Doppler echocardiography may play an interesting role in the diagnostic non invasive procedure of pulmonary arteriovenous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
