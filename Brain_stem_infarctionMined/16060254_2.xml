<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report our experience with stenting for symptomatic vertebrobasilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One hundred and sixteen patients with vertebrobasilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> (101 vertebral ostial stenosis, 15 intracranial vertebrobasilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp>) were treated with stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Indication criteria of treatment were 1) symptomatic lesion, 2) angiographical stenosis more than 60% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Under local anesthesia, pre-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> was first performed, then stents were placed to the lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Successful <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> was obtained in 115 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The stenosis rate reduced to 2% post-stenting in ostial lesions and 16% in intracranial lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Transient neurological complications developed in 2 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Follow-up angiographies more than 6 months after stenting were performed in 94 patients with ostial lesions and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with intracranial lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of these, 8 patients (9.5%) with ostial lesions and 4 patients (27%) with intracranial lesions developed restenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with restenosis were treated successfully with <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> (percutaneous transluminal angioplasty) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>During the follow-up period, 3 patients developed recurrence of VBI (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042568" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vertebro-basilar insufficiency</z:e>) symptoms due to restenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One patient developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain stem infarction</z:e> due to in-stent occlusion 8 months after stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Conclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Stenting for vertebrobasilar artery stenoses is feasible and safe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Prevention of restenosis, especially in intracranial arteries, is the next problem to be solved </plain></SENT>
