<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The lesions are categorized by anatomic location into subpial (5 cases), epidural (3 cases), and paraspinal (6 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were no dural <z:hpo ids='HP_0004947'>arteriovenous fistulas</z:hpo> in this group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The subpial lesions include both the intramedullary <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformations</z:hpo> (2 cases) and the perimedullary <z:hpo ids='HP_0004947'>arteriovenous fistulas</z:hpo> (3 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two of the patients with perimedullary <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistulas</z:mpath> were first cousins and both had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039445" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Rendu-Osler-Weber syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The six paraspinallesions were vertebral-vertebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistulas</z:mpath> with five of these located at the first cervical metamere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eleven cases (79%) were <z:hpo ids='HP_0004947'>arteriovenous fistulas</z:hpo> and three cases (21 %) were <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformations</z:hpo> with a nidus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were nine (82%) high flow arteriovenous fistulae and two (18%) low flow arteriovenous fistulae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The ages range from seven months to 15 years, with a mean age of seven years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were nine males and five females </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Two patients were treated by N-butyl cyanoacrylate (NBCA) alone, two with NBCA and coils, one with balloons alone, three with balloons and coils and two with coils alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In the endovascular treatment group, nine fistulae were completely obliterated (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> high flow fistulae) and one patient had partial treatment (a spinal cord <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformation</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>There were no complications from endovascular treatment </plain></SENT>
