<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM: Our aim is to present the case of a 13-year-old girl with a delayed proper diagnosis of incomplete expression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">KTS</z:e> presenting with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001052'>port-wine stain</z:hpo> of her left lower extremity associated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> of the affected limb (upon the moment of diagnosis no <z:hpo ids='HP_0002619'>varicose veins</z:hpo> were observed) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patient did not experience any pain in the affected limb, nor was she diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e> - both of above mentioned symptoms are often a significant issue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To ensure proper diagnosis, the patient underwent a broad spectrum of diagnostic tests, including physical examination with anthropometric measuring, biochemical tests, as well as radiological examinations including CT scan, Doppler vein ultrasound and bone X-ray </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Based on physical examination and test results we were able to establish the diagnosis of incomplete expression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022739" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="KTS">Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY: The authors aim to emphasise the very rare incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">KTS</z:e>, as well as the low level of awareness of the described disease, which resulted in the significantly delayed final diagnosis in the presented case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Establishing the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">KTS</z:e> before the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of severe vascular complications, regular check-ups in the Outpatient Clinic of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018916" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Haemangioma</z:e> Care and compression dressing may help avoid/diminish the severity and significantly delay the development of venous failure of the affected limb </plain></SENT>
