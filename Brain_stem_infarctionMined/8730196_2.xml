<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To estimate the prevalence of abnormal ocular enhancement in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome</z:e> as detected with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging and CT and to correlate this with the clinical, fundoscopic, and intracranial imaging findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifteen children, 4 years old or younger, with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome</z:e> were examined with enhanced CT and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eleven children had unilateral intracranial involvement and 4 had bilateral involvement, for a total of 19 abnormal hemispheres and related orbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The presence of ocular enhancement was compared with the fundoscopic findings independently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ocular enhancement was correlated with the extent of leptomeningeal disease, the severity of the cutaneous lesion, and the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> by the calculation of likelihood ratios and 95% confidence limits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seven of the 15 patients had abnormal ocular enhancement, which was present in 10 (53%) of the eyes associated with the 19 abnormal hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging showed choroidal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001028'>hemangioma</z:hpo> in 7 of 8 patients in whom <z:hpo ids='HP_0001028'>hemangiomas</z:hpo> were shown at fundoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The likelihood of ocular enhancement was increased with the presence of bilateral disease, extensive facial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027960" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">nevi</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo>; there was no significant correlation with the extent of hemispheric involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Both enhanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging and CT can show diffuse choroidal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001028'>hemangioma</z:hpo> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging is more sensitive and is recommended to aid in the detection of abnormalities with preventable late complications </plain></SENT>
