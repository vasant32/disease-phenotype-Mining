<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among the cerebrocerebellar pathways possibly involved, the corticopontocerebellar pathway is considered to be the most important to induce CCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>According to the hypothesis that CCD results from the destruction of the corticopontocerebellar pathway, any lesion wherever located in the corticopontocerebellar pathway may induce CCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Little is known, however, about CCD after the brainstem lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our case presented here showed that a brainstem lesion actually induced CCD and that CCD resulted from transneuronal deactivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An 80-year-old female was admitted to the neurological department of Kasugai City Hospital because of left-sided <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> of sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> on March 19, 1989 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On admission and 5 days after admission CT scan of the brain was performed, but no <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> lesion was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain disclosed a localized lesion in the right peduncle and tegmentum of the midbrain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computerized tomography of the brain using N-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30353">isopropyl</z:chebi>-P-(123I) iodoamphetamine (<z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi>) performed about a month after admission disclosed decreased blood flow in the left hemisphere of the cerebellum compared with the right one and the findings of CCD were observed </plain></SENT>
