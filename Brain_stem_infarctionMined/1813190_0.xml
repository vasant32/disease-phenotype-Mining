<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We reported a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brainstem infarction</z:e> who presented paralytic pontine <z:hpo ids='HP_0000577'>exotropia</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="8" ids="53256">PPE</z:chebi>) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase and non-paralytic pontine <z:hpo ids='HP_0000577'>exotropia</z:hpo> (NPPE) during the recovery phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On March 10, 1991, a 60-year-old man was brought to our hospital with chief complaints of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000651'>double vision</z:hpo> and right <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The ocular position of the left eye on forward gaze was fixed at the midline, while the right eye was abducted, and skew deviation was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On leftward gaze, neither eye could pass the midline, and on rightward gaze the right eye was abducted and monocular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000639'>nystagmus</z:hpo> was noted in the abducted right eye, which indicated paralytic pontine <z:hpo ids='HP_0000577'>exotropia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>T2-weighted MRI showed high signal intensity lesions in the left paramedian portion of the mid-pontine tegmentum beneath the fourth ventricle, and in the midline of the pontine base extending to the left side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The next day, similar disturbance of ocular movement was seen on rightward gaze, but the limitation of leftward gaze had improved and NPPE was noted to have developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the third day, there was no abduction of the right eye on forward gaze, but left MLF syndrome was still present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Seven days later, the disturbances of ocular movement disappeared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The lesion was considered to be due to partial impairment of the left paramedian pontine reticular formation in addition to the MLF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="8" ids="53256">PPE</z:chebi> caused by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> due to the perforating arteries of the brainstem, different from that due to basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> may recover after progression through NPPE and MLF syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Hence, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1282373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">one-and-a-half syndrome</z:e>, <z:chebi fb="8" ids="53256">PPE</z:chebi>, NPPE, and MLF syndromes are considered to be analogous to one another </plain></SENT>
