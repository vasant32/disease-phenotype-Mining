<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0004952'>Pulmonary arteriovenous fistulas</z:hpo> (PAVFs) are a rare and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> malformation prevalently associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039445" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Rendu-Osler-Weber syndrome</z:e>, and may mimic <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001694'>right-to-left shunt</z:hpo> (RLS), leading to unnecessary interventions and in some cases to relapses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Residual shunt is increasingly being observed both after <z:mp ids='MP_0004225'>PFO</z:mp> closure and PAVF embolization, even at long-term follow-up, with unclear clinical relevance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This instrumental and possibly therapeutic failure could lie in the presence of pulmonary microfistulas, either pre-existing or following the intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hence, if RLS persists after optimal device placement and reasonable endothelialization time, the presence of a PAVF should be assumed and investigated; if RLS recurs after previous, negative echocontrast studies, presence of device-related complications or pulmonary microfistulas should be taken into consideration </plain></SENT>
