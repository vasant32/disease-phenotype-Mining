<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Provocative testing with sequential intraarterial injections of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2673">amobarbital</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi> was done before embolization of 66 vascular pedicles in 26 patients with the following pathologic disorders: 8 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002858'>meningiomas</z:hpo>, 7 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002668'>paragangliomas</z:hpo>, 5 dural <z:hpo ids='HP_0004947'>arteriovenous fistulas</z:hpo>, 3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0010615'>angiofibromas</z:hpo>, 1 endolymphatic sac <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, 1 metastatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0005584'>renal carcinoma</z:hpo>, and 1 Rendu-Osler-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505,C0022739,C0455717" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Weber syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Findings during provocative testing and any postembolization deficits were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 66 vascular pedicles tested, only 1 showed positive findings on an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2673">amobarbital</z:chebi> test, in which the patient had transient numbness in the contralateral leg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi> tests were positive, in 7 cases, in which cranial nerve deficits were suspected on the basis of anatomic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> deficits resolved within 15 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>If results of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2673">amobarbital</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi> tests were positive, large particles or coils were used for embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Otherwise, small particles or liquid agents were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no complications after embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Provocative testing with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2673">amobarbital</z:chebi> can reveal dangerous anastomoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Testing with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi> can show vascular supply to the cranial nerves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>With the use of appropriate protocols, embolization in the external carotid territory can be done with minimal risk </plain></SENT>
