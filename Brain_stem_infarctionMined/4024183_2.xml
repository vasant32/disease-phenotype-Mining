<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The BAER was abnormal in 92% of patients with evidence on physical examination of dysfunction of lateral structures in the pons or midbrain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> BAERs were seen with medially-situated or medullary lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When both rostrocaudal level and lateralization were considered, the BAER indicated damage in additional areas not evident on physical examination in 25% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, physical signs indicated damage in areas not reflected by the BAER in 22% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the BAER complements the localization obtained from physical findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>BAERs were abnormal in more of these patients than were CT scans, and thus are useful for confirmation of bedside impressions </plain></SENT>
