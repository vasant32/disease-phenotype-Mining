<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Four types of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> have been recognized with type II (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001052'>nevus flammeus</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100814'>Mongolian spots</z:hpo>) being the most common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Most early cases were of Asian or African descent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Many cases were subsequently associated with Sturge-Weber (S-W) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022739" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="KTS">Klippel-Trenaunay</z:e> (K-T) syndromes </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We present six cases of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi> in which five were either African, Asian or Hispanic, and five of six had an admixture of K-T and S-W </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000256'>macrocephaly</z:hpo>, and one had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000252'>microcephaly</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four had <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> abnormalities (three with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo>, one with Arnold-Chiari and one with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002126'>polymicrogyria</z:hpo>), three had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo>, and one had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
