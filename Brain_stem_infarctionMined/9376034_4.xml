<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Over the last years several laser systems have been used for therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Only a few studies have published results of Nd:YAG laser therapy evaluating a larger number of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 1987 through 1996, forty-one patients with HHT were treated with a Nd:YAG laser due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004406'>recurrent epistaxis</z:hpo> at the Department of Otorhinolaryngology of Kiel University </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty-two patients were followed-up over a period of at least 24 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A centripetal technique was used for endonasal laser light application (15-25 Watts; 0.1-0.5 s), i.e., the laser light was applied from the periphery towards the center of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0267370,C0085411" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">angiodysplasia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intensive preoperative and postoperative nasal care with ointments was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>Bleeding</z:mp> frequency and intensity decreased in 30 (94%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Duration of the therapeutical success differed individually and varied from seven weeks to 14 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Repeated laser therapy was necessary in 27 of 32 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The Nd:YAG laser is a suitable tool in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000421'>epistaxis</z:hpo> in HHT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This procedure is less traumatic, less painful, and can be repeated multiple times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Nd:YAG laser therapy and other therapeutic options cannot obtain a lasting cure of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039445" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Rendu-Osler-Weber syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, in the vast majority of cases recurrent nasal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> as the dominant symptom can be reduced in frequency as well as in intensity </plain></SENT>
