<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022739" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="KTS">Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome (KTS)</z:e> is a congenital group of disorders characterised by vascular malformations (capillary malformation (CM), venous malformation (VM), and lymphatic malformation (LM)) and disturbed growth regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The burden caused by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">KTS</z:e> symptoms can be evaluated using Quality of Life (QoL)-measuring questionnaires </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to assess the QoL in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">KTS</z:e> patients using the Short Form Health Survey Questionnaire (SF-36) and Skindex-29 questionnaires, and to determine three grades of severity (mild, moderate and severe) according to the scores obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, we compared the SF-36 results to those of a general Dutch population sample and a selected group of other <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">KTS</z:e> patients of the Dutch <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">KTS</z:e> foundation and of two medical centres answered SF-36 and Skindex-29 questionnaires </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Control data of validated Dutch population SF-36 scores and literature-acquired scores for other diseases were available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 78 patients were enrolled, of whom 34 (43.6%) were male; the mean age was 39.3 years (SD: 17.1; range: 12-78 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The Dutch <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">KTS</z:e> group scored significantly lower than the general Dutch population on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> SF-36 scales except Mental Health and Role Emotional </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, they scored significantly lower than other medical conditions on the Physical Functioning and Bodily Pain scales </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>According to the Skindex-29 results, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">KTS</z:e> patients fall in the categories - symptoms: severe to very severe; emotions: diminutive to mild and functions: mild </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The total score is lower than 40, indicating a negligible negative impact on QoL; however, new cut-off values are being calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Classification according to severity is important to educate patients accordingly, predict prognosis and set treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Especially in cases of severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">KTS</z:e>, physicians should not only be attentive to the physical aspects but also to the psychological and social aspects of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">KTS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
