<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>Dysphagia</z:hpo> is a major complication in hemispheric as well as brainstem <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients causing <z:hpo ids='HP_0011951'>aspiration pneumonia</z:hpo> and increased mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Little is known about the recovery from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to determine the different patterns of cortical swallowing processing in patients with hemispheric and brainstem <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> with and without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> in the early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We measured brain activity by mean of whole-head MEG in 37 patients with different <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> localisation 8.2+/-4.8 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> to study changes in cortical activation during self-paced swallowing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An age matched group of healthy subjects served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Data were analyzed by means of synthetic aperture magnetometry and group analyses were performed using a permutation test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Our results demonstrate strong bilateral reduction of cortical swallowing activation in dysphagic patients with hemispheric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In hemispheric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> without <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo>, bilateral activation was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the small group of patients with brainstem <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> we observed a reduction of cortical activation and a right hemispheric lateralization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Bulbar central pattern generators coordinate the pharyngeal swallowing phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The observed right hemispheric lateralization in brainstem <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> can therefore be interpreted as <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cortical compensation of subcortically caused <z:hpo ids='HP_0002015'>dysphagia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The reduction of activation in brainstem <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients and dysphagic patients with cortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> could be explained in terms of diaschisis </plain></SENT>
