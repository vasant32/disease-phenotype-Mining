<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report the rare case of a patient, JNR, with history of mixed handedness, developmental <z:hpo ids='HP_0010522'>dyslexia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0010526'>dysgraphia</z:hpo>, and attentional deficits associated with a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022739" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="KTS">Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome</z:e> and a small subcortical frontal lesion involving the left arcuate fasciculus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In adulthood, he suffered a large right perisylvian <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and developed atypical conduction <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> with deficits in input and output phonological processing and poor auditory-verbal short-term memory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Lexical-semantic processing for single words was intact, but he was unable to access meaning in sentence comprehension and repetition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Reading and writing deficits worsened after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and he presented a combination of developmental and acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0010526'>dysgraphia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0010522'>dyslexia</z:hpo> with mixed lexical and phonological processing deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This case suggest that a small lesion sustained prenatally or early in life could induce a selective rightward shift of phonology sparing the standard left hemisphere lateralisation of lexical-semantic functions </plain></SENT>
