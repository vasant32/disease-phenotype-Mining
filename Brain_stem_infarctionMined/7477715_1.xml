<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The patient was a 10-year-old boy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>He had a sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of generalized <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014549" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tonic-clonic convulsion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On admission, he presented with mild disturbance of consciousness and right <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The electroencephalogram showed diffuse spike and slow wave complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three days later, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed high signal intensity areas in the left cerebellar hemisphere and pons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On cerebral angiograms, coiling of the bilateral carotid arteries, occlusion of the basilar artery at the distal site, and fenestration of the left vertebral artery at the atlanto-axis level were shown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>According to these findings, the patient was diagnosed with brainstem and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0236073" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebellar infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On the follow-up angiograms, recanalization of the basilar artery on the right vertebral angiogram, occlusion of the left vertebral artery at the distal site of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery origin, and occlusion of one of the duplicated vertebral arteries were recognized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fenestration of the vertebral artery is presented in about 1-2% at angiography and autopsy and the clinical significance is controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In this case, the fenestration may have played a role as an embolic source because there was no probable cause of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">vascular occlusion</z:e> and recanalization occurred near the distal site of the fenestration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest the clinical significance of vertebral artery fenestration as an embolic source </plain></SENT>
