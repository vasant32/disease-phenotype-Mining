<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE AND IMPORTANCE: Spinal cord injury is a rare complication of neurosurgery performed with the patient in the sitting position </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous reports showed that the level of injury is usually located at or near the C5 segmental spinal level, and the term midcervical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002445'>quadriplegia</z:hpo> has been proposed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Extensive spinal cord and lower <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brainstem infarction</z:e> also can occur after posterior fossa surgery performed with the patient in the sitting position </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL PRESENTATION: We describe a 45-year-old woman who was operated on in the sitting position because of a fourth ventricular pilocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0009592'>astrocytoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After surgery, the patient experienced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002445'>quadriplegia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging scans revealed a long, hyperintense area within the cervicothoracic spinal cord that was extended to the lower pons and was consistent with infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no evidence of previous spine disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patient died 6 weeks later of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>respiratory failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We speculate that alteration of spinal cord blood flow by stretching of the cervical spinal cord and spinal epidural venous engorgement might have caused this devastating complication </plain></SENT>
