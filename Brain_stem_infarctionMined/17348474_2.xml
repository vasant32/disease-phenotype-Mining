<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since there is no cure for this disorder, treatment is directed towards secondary prevention of venous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and preservation of functional integrity of the legs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Elastic stockings are the mainstay of treatment and are indicated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Surgery is reserved only for a few selected symptomatic patients, however the outcome is unsatisfactory in most cases, with recurrent pain, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>, poor cosmetic result and limb deformity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy is a recently introduced minimally invasive ambulatory procedure for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0005293'>venous insufficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It was recently introduced to treat this disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy of USFS in the treatment of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022739" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="KTS">Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seven patients diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022739" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="KTS">Klippel-Trenaunay</z:e>, with massive lower extremity involvement, were treated with USFS between October 2003 and October 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sclerovein (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="46859">polidocanol</z:chebi>, Resinag, Switzerland) 2-4% was used as the sclerosant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The signs, symptoms and overall patient satisfaction were assessed before, during and after the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients' mean age was 26 years (range 15-54) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The CEAP clinical classification, with ascending severity ranging from 0 (no signs) to 6 (active venous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath>), was C4 in five patients (71.5%) and C5 and C6 in one patient each </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The average number of sessions was 14.5 (range 9-21) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No major complications were encountered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> seven patients reported improvement in signs and symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Five of the 7 patients (71%) were very satisfied with the cosmetic result </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: USFS is an effective minimally invasive ambulatory technique, essentially pain-free and with excellent short-term results in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022739" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="KTS">Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome</z:e> (when the deep system is functional) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Long-term results and larger study groups are warranted </plain></SENT>
