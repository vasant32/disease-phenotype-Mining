<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We examined the light microscopic and ultrastructural features associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber disease</z:e>, including x-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy to evaluate the chemical composition of the mineralized deposits and immunofluorescence microscopy with leukocyte <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules to examine the blood vessel proliferation further </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two patients (a 17-year-old girl and a 9-month-old boy) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber disease</z:e> comprise this series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mineralized deposits stained strongly positive with von Kossa and negative with <z:chebi fb="27" ids="30069">Prussian blue</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transmission electron microscopy of tissue removed during a functional hemispherectomy procedure in both cases indicated that most <z:mpath ids='MPATH_614'>concretions</z:mpath> were adjacent to or in the basal lamina of parenchymal vessels; no deposits were observed in leptomeningeal vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Energy dispersive spectroscopy of the deposits showed emission peaks corresponding predominantly to calcium, with lesser amounts of <z:chebi fb="81" ids="28659,35895">phosphorus</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fluorescent monoclonal antibodies to leukocyte <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules (endothelial cell, vascular cell, and intercellular: ELAM-1, VCAM-1, and ICAM-1) demonstrated strong positive staining of the meningeal vessels with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cortical vessels were positive only for ICAM-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Findings based on routine staining and energy dispersive spectroscopy indicate that the mineralized deposits detected in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber disease</z:e> are composed primarily of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9679">calcium phosphate</z:chebi> and are located primarily in and adjacent to the vascular basal lamina </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There is an aberrant expression of ELAM-1 and VCAM-1 in the meningeal vascular proliferation similar to what is observed with other vascular malformations and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Parenchymal vessel changes may be secondary to the meningeal vascular proliferation </plain></SENT>
