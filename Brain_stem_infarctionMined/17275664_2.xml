<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After 7 months of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> freedom, the patient developed typical myoclonic-<z:hpo ids='HP_0010819'>astatic seizures</z:hpo> associated with generalized electrographic discharges, which worsened as oxcarbazepine was increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> and electroencephalogram improved dramatically in 3 weeks as the oxcarbazepine was withdrawn and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39867">valproic acid</z:chebi> was initiated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This case demonstrates the importance of recognizing that children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> due to focal lesions can develop secondary bilateral synchrony that can be aggravated by medications that are effective for <z:hpo ids='HP_0007359'>partial seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In such cases, treatment with a broad-spectrum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">antiepileptic</z:chebi> may be advantageous </plain></SENT>
