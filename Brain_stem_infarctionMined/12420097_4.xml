<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Small <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brainstem infarctions</z:e> are increasingly recognized as a cause of isolated ocular motor and vestibular nerve palsies in diabetic and/or hypertensive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This raises the question whether there are also isolated 7(th) nerve palsies due to pontine infarctions in patients with such risk factors for the development of cerebrovascular diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Over an 11-year-period, we retrospectively identified 10 diabetic and/or hypertensive patients with isolated 7(th) nerve palsies and electrophysiological abnormalities indicating pontine dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had examinations of masseter and blink reflexes, brainstem auditory evoked potentials, direct current electro-oculography including bithermal caloric testing, and T1- and T2-weighted MRI (slice thickness: 4-7 mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Electrophysiological abnormalities on the side of the 7(th) nerve palsy included delayed masseter reflex latencies (4 patients), slowed abduction saccades (4 patients), vestibular <z:mp ids='MP_0000754'>paresis</z:mp> (2 patients), and abnormal following eye movements (2 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Electrophysiological abnormalities were always improved or normalized at re-examination, which was always associated with clinical improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MRI revealed an ipsilateral pontine infarction in 2 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Another 2 had bilateral hyperintense intrapontine lesions, and one an ipsilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0236073" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebellar infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Simultaneous improvement or recovery of abnormal clinical and electrophysiological findings strongly indicated that both were caused by the same actual pontine lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A 7(th) nerve palsy may be the only clinical sign of a pontine infarction in diabetic and/or hypertensive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Such mechanism may be underestimated if based on MRI only </plain></SENT>
