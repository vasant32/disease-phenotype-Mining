<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although Klippel-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Tr</z:e>énaunay syndrome is a mixed vascular malformation characterized by abnormal growth in the extremities, no uniform diagnostic criteria have been established because of the variety in its manifestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Consequently, no anatomical analysis based on a comparison study has been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, the authors determine the frequency of various vascular malformations and abnormal growth and assess any statistical relationship between vascular malformation type/location and abnormal growth in terms of length and girth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-five patients with Klippel-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Tr</z:e>énaunay syndrome satisfying the criteria proposed by Oduber et al. in 2008 were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The type and location of the vascular malformation and abnormal circumferential growth were assessed by magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Bone girth was assessed by axial magnetic resonance imaging/computed tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Plain radiographs of the long bones were used to measure growth in length </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The spectrum of vascular types was similar to that in previous reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no significant association between leg length and vascular malformation type or location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Leg bone circumferential <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> was observed in 50 percent of cases and was significantly related to the presence of intramuscular lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A single venous malformation in the subcutaneous tissue was significantly associated with the presence of subcutaneous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients with intramuscular lymphatic malformations had a significantly higher frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0009004'>muscle hypoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The type and location of certain vascular malformations were significantly associated with abnormal subcutaneous tissue, muscle, and bone growth </plain></SENT>
