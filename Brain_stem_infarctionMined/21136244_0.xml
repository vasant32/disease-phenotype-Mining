<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Furthermore telengiectatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> in terms of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003764'>naevus</z:hpo> flammeus could be found at the right leg and foot as well as genital and gluteal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By birth the right leg of the patient was longer than the other one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In spite of initiation of several therapies the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> was refractory to different therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The clinical diagnosis of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0005293'>venous insufficiency</z:hpo> of the right leg was clearly proven by apparative diagnostic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In consequence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> findings we diagnosed a Klippel-Trenaunnay syndrome consisting of the typical trias of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003764'>naevus</z:hpo> flammeus, hemihypertrophie of bone and soft tissue as well as angiodysplasies with a distinct <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0005293'>venous insufficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The presented case describes a patient with a Klippel-Trenaunnay syndrome as a seldom cause of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> leg <z:mpath ids='MPATH_579'>ulcer</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although it is a very rare cause for a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> wound it should be known by physicians to be considered in the differential diagnosis process </plain></SENT>
