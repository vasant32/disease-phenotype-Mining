<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The IVDSA's were considered <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in 50 of 70 conventional carotid endarterectomies and in 46 of 50 carotid endarterectomies with SVPG (p = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The internal carotid artery (ICA) origin was consistently larger and had a more <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> configuration after carotid endarterectomy with SVPG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ballooning at the endarterectomy site was an uncommon finding and occurred with similar frequency in both groups; that is, after three conventional carotid endarterectomies and two carotid endarterectomies with SVPG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the conventional group, early symptomatic <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> occurred in the ICA in one patient and in the common carotid artery (CCA), ICA, and external carotid artery (ECA) in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Silent ICA occlusion was seen in three patients in the conventional group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no occlusions in the SVPG group (p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Stenosis at the distal end of the ICA arteriotomy was found after nine conventional carotid endarterectomies, and was mild (less than or equal to 33% reduction in the lumen) in seven patients, moderate (34% to 66%) in one, and severe (greater than or equal to 67%) in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mild distal ICA stenosis was seen in one case after carotid endarterectomy with a SVPG (p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Stenosis of 33% or less was found at the proximal end of the CCA arteriotomy after two carotid endarterectomies in the conventional group and one carotid endarterectomy in the SVPG group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Four patients in the conventional group suffered a postoperative cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and one patient in the SVPG group suffered a postoperative brain-stem <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> (p = 0.28) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The authors' findings have led them to routinely use a SVPG in carotid endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
