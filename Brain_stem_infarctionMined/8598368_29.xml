<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Children under 5 years old with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002885'>medulloblastoma</z:hpo> (MB) have a poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They are more susceptible to the deleterious effects of craniospinal irradiation (CSART) and have a higher relapse rate when treated with low-dose CSART alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We, thus, embarked on a prospective trial testing the usefulness of very low dose CSART and adjuvant chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This is an update of a previous report on these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between January 1988 and March 1990, 10 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002885'>medulloblastoma</z:hpo> were treated using 18 Gy radiation therapy (RT) to the craniospinal axis, a posterior fossa (PF) boost to 50.4-55.8 Gy and chemotherapy consisting of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi> (VCR) weekly during RT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This was followed by VCR, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27899">cis-diamminedichloroplatinum</z:chebi> (CDDP), and lomustine (CCNU) for eight, 6-week cycles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients between 18 and 60 months of age without evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> dissemination were eligible for study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Follow-up was available until September 1994 with a median follow-up for living patients of 6.3 years from diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Actuarial survival at over 6 years is 70 +/- 20% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three of the 10 patients relapsed and died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In one patient, the relapse developed in the spine and brain outside the posterior fossa, in the second, concurrently in the posterior fossa, brain and spine, and the third, only in the spine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One surviving child developed a brain stem <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> 4.8 years after diagnosis and has since almost fully recovered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A mean intelligence quotient (IQ) score of 103 in six patients surviving at least 1 year is unchanged from the baseline group score of 107 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Five children tested at baseline and 2 years following treatment had IQ scores of 101 and 102, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Six children tested at baseline and at 3 years had IQ scores of 106 and 96, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Excluding the child tested shortly after his brain stem <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, baseline and 3 year IQ scores were 103 and 97, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Five of the seven long-term survivors grew at rates significantly below their expected velocities during the follow-up period, while the others grew normally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Three patients have received growth hormone, and none have required thyroid replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002885'>medulloblastoma</z:hpo> patients can be cured with chemotherapy and reduced doses of craniospinal irradiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The low doses of CSART given by us in conjunction with cis-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="33364">platin</z:chebi>-based chemotherapy produce minimal neurocognitive damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Growth velocities in very young children so treated are, however, dramatically reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Better means of improving the therapeutic ratio are still needed </plain></SENT>
