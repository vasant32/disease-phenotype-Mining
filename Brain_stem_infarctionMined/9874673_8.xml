<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have shown that in contrast to inflammatory lesions observed in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> virus type 1 (HIV-1) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002383'>encephalitis</z:hpo>, in which monocytes/macrophages are the prevailing mononuclear cells, these infiltrates consist mostly of lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Perivascular mononuclear-cell infiltrates were found in brain tissue specimens collected at autopsy from five of six children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> and consisted of CD3(+) T cells and equal or greater proportions of CD68(+) monocytes/macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transmural (including endothelial) mononuclear-cell infiltrates were evident in one patient and comprised predominantly CD3(+) T cells and small or, in certain vessels, approximately equal proportions of CD68(+) monocytes/macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a clear preponderance of CD3(+) CD8(+) T cells on the endothelial side of transmural infiltrates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In active lesions of transmural <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo>, CD3(+) T-cell infiltrates exhibited a distinctive zonal distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The majority of CD3(+) cells were also CD8(+) and CD45RO+ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Scattered perivascular monocytes/macrophages in foci of florid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> were immunoreactive for the p24 core protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast to the perivascular space, the intervening brain neuropil was dominated by monocytes/macrophages, microglia, and reactive astrocytes, containing only scant CD3(+) CD8(+) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Five of six patients showed evidence of calcific vasculopathy, but only two exhibited HIV-1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002383'>encephalitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One patient had multiple <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> cerebral and brainstem <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> associated with a widespread, fulminant mononuclear-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A second patient had an old brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> associated with fibrointimal thickening of large leptomeningeal vessels </plain></SENT>
