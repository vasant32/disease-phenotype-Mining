<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Venous duplex scanning, ascending venography, magnetic resonance imaging, strain gauge plethysmography, and a bone scanogram were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We studied eight men and seven women aged 15 to 51 years (median, 24 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">KTS</z:e> involved 17 limbs (unilateral in 13 patients and bilateral in 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Contralateral limbs in patients with unilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">KTS</z:e> acted as controls (n = 13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Venous clinical severity was graded according to the CEAP and venous clinical severity score (VCSS), and reflux complexity was classified according to the venous segmental disease score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Outflow obstruction (outflow fraction at 1 and 4 seconds; OF(1) and OF(4), respectively), reflux (venous filling index), calf muscle pump function (ejection fraction), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (residual volume fraction) were determined in both limbs with strain gauge plethysmography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Data, reported as median and interquartile range, were analyzed with the Mann-Whitney test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002619'>Varicose veins</z:hpo> or venous malformations occurred in the medial, posterior, or anterolateral limb segments of the ankle (7/17, 7/17, and 9/17), calf (10/17, 8/17, and 12/17), knee (9/17, 8/17, and 8/17), and thigh (10/17, 6/17, and 8/17, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Venous malformations occupied the subcutaneous space (17/17) and extended into the subfascial space in 6 (35.3%) of 17 limbs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Abnormal reflux (&gt;0.5 seconds) was distributed in the great (64.7%; 11/17) and small (5.9%; 1/17) saphenous veins and the common femoral (23.5%; 4/17), femoral (41.1%; 7/17), popliteal (29.4%; 5/17), perforator (70.6%; 12/17), and axial calf (35.3%; 6/17) veins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in the OF(1) and OF(4) between the affected limbs and the controls </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Patients complained of swelling (100%; 15/15), aching (100%; 15/15), pain (93.3%; 14/15) and heaviness (100%; 15/15), tiredness (66.7%; 10/15), and tightness (33.3%; 5/15) of the limb(s) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">KTS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Limbs with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">KTS</z:e> had a worse (1) venous clinical severity by 11 VCSS points (11 [8-12] vs 0 [0-1]) and (2) clinical status by 3 CEAP classes (C3 [C3-C4] vs C0 [C0-C2]) than the control limbs (both P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
