<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 10 patients (seven men, three women; mean age, 59 years) were treated by external ventricular drainage and decompressive suboccipital craniectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After discharge from the hospital, they were followed up (23-101 months) and their functional independence was evaluated by the Barthel Index </plain></SENT>
