<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Genomic DNA was obtained from peripheral blood of nine patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> SWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The 25 exons, promoter regions (-1,000 bp) as well as intron-exon boundaries of RASA1 were amplified by polymerase chain reaction, and products were sequenced directly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A novel synonymous mutation (c.1229 G &gt; A [p.K420K]) of RASA1 was identified in the present series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: It implied that RASA1 may be not a virulence gene, but further study is needed to know RASA1 gene mutation in SWS patients </plain></SENT>
