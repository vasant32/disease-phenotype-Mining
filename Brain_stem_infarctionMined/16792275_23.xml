<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The 30 research communications and papers are the direct outcome of the Third International Meeting on Brain-Computer Interface Technology held at the Rensselaerville Institute, Rensselaerville, NY, in June 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fifty-three research groups from North and South America, Europe, and Asia, representing the majority of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the existing BCI laboratories around the world, participated in this highly focused meeting sponsored by the National Institutes of Health and organized by the BCI Laboratory of the Wadsworth Center of the New York State Department of Health </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As demonstrated by the papers in this special issue, the rapid advances in BCI research and development make this technology capable of providing communication and control to people severely disabled by <z:hpo ids='HP_0007354'>amyotrophic lateral sclerosis</z:hpo> (ALS), brainstem <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100021'>cerebral palsy</z:hpo>, and other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852419,C0027868" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuromuscular disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Future work is expected to improve the performance and utility of BCIs, and to focus increasingly on making them a viable, practical, and affordable communication alternative for many thousands of severely disabled people worldwide </plain></SENT>
