<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Time-locked video/digital EEG recording was carried out for ictal studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MRI was performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SPECT showed hemispheric hypoperfusion interictally in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three patients and also ictally in one of the three; a small region of hyperperfusion was seen on the same ictal scan in the latter, ie. the patient with interictal and ictal hypoperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the two older children middle cerebral artery velocity (MCAV) was reduced by between 29 and 62% in the middle cerebral artery of the predominantly affected hemisphere compared with the contralateral side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, increases of 6 to 30% in MCAV were recorded for the clinically seizing hemisphere compared with 24 to 170% for the contralateral side in four of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In one infant, MCAV fell bilaterally during a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> that generalized (-18 and -43% in the predominantly affected and contralateral side respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sequential recordings in one infant suggested that, with time, the haemodynamic response to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> of the unaffected hemisphere may decrease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the venous malformation in SWS is associated with an impairment of the cerebral haemodynamic response to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> activity </plain></SENT>
