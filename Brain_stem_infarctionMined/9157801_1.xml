<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective review of the records of patients diagnosed of SSW (facial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001052'>nevus flammeus</z:hpo> at least over the first branch of the trigeminal nerve and ipsilateral leptomeningeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002947'>angioma</z:mp>) was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifteen patients were found in our records, with one of them being excluded from the study due to the lack of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From the remaining 14, 11 had been diagnosed before the age of 18 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001052'>Nevus flammeus</z:hpo> was located on the right side in 8 cases, bilaterally in 3 and on the left side in the other 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four cases had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo>, 3 of which had good evolution after trabeculotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirteen of the 14 patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, usually contralateral to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001052'>nevus flammeus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The main drugs used were phenytoin, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="8069">phenobarbital</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39867">valproic acid</z:chebi> and carbamazepine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ten of the 13 patients treated had a good therapeutical response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The EEG was abnormal in 12 patients, two of them occurring during the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The main abnormality found was an interhemispherical asymmetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Nine patients developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In reference to the neuroimaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> was better than CT in evaluating parenchymatous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath>, which was present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, and the abnormalities of the white and grey matters (9 and 8 patients, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Early evaluation of newborns with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001052'>nevus flammeus</z:hpo> affecting the first branch of the trigeminal nerve must be done, including an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> with contrast and an ophthalmological exam </plain></SENT>
