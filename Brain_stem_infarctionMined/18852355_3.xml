<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Little is known about <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> mechanisms in patients with fluctuating symptoms and the role of branch atherosclerotic disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To report a novel <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> presentation associated with a paramedian pontine <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> due to branch disease with a fluctuating course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Case report </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Academic research </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patient A 63-year-old man with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e> was seen with fluctuating right-sided <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001260'>dysarthria</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>He had had 2 episodes of complete bilateral horizontal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0702143" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">conjugate gaze palsy</z:e> with unimpaired consciousness lasting for 5 minutes each </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>His pupils were 4 mm and were equal and reactive to light </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Vertical gaze and convergence were preserved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>His neurologic status fluctuated between 3 and 15 on the National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Results of computed tomographic angiography, perfusion, and magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Intravenous tissue plasminogen activator was administered within a 3-hour window </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Fluctuations in motor <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> persisted for 12 hours after receiving thrombolytic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Neuroimaging showed an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> left paramedian pontine <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> with a patent basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Branch disease is a common mechanism in pontine infarctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>We coined the term "pontine warning syndrome" to characterize recurrent stereotyped episodes of motor or sensory dysfunction, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001260'>dysarthria</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000602'>ophthalmoplegia</z:hpo> associated with a high risk of imminent basilar artery branch infarction and a permanent deficit resembling those of capsular warning syndrome </plain></SENT>
