<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Vertebral artery injury (VAI) after blunt cervical trauma occurs more frequently than historically believed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The symptoms due to vertebral artery (VA) occlusion usually manifest within the first 24 hours after trauma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Misdiagnosed VAI or delay in diagnosis has been reported to cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> deterioration of previously conscious and neurologically intact patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CASE PRESENTATION: A 67 year-old male was involved in a motor vehicle crash (MVC) sustaining multiple injuries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Initial evaluation by the emergency medical response team revealed that he was alert, oriented, and neurologically intact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>He was transferred to the local hospital where cervical spine computed tomography (CT) revealed several abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Distraction and subluxation was present at C5-C6 and a comminuted fracture of the left lateral mass of C6 with violation of the transverse foramen was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Unavailability of a spine specialist prompted the patient's transfer to an area medical center equipped with spine care capabilities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After arrival, the patient became unresponsive and neurological deficits were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>His continued deterioration prompted yet another transfer to our Level 1 regional trauma center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A repeat cervical spine CT at our institution revealed significantly worsened subluxation at C5-C6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CT angiogram also revealed complete occlusion of bilateral VA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The following day, a repeat CT of the head revealed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain stem infarction</z:e> due to bilateral VA occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Shortly following, the patient was diagnosed with brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and care was withdrawn </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Brain stem infarction</z:e> secondary to bilateral VA occlusion following cervical spine trauma resulted in fatal outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Prompt imaging evaluation is necessary to assess for VAI in cervical trauma cases with facet joint subluxation/dislocation or transverse foramen fracture so that treatment is not delayed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Additionally, multiple transportation events are risk factors for worsening when unstable cervical injuries are present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Close attention to proper immobilization and neck position depending on the mechanism of injury is mandatory </plain></SENT>
