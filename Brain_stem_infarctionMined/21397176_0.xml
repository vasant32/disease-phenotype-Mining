<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report on a girl with cutaneous <z:mp ids='MP_0002947'>angioma</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> who presented the characteristics of the condition described by Shapiro and Shulman </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At birth, she manifested extensive pink discoloration on her face, scalp, and back </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During infancy, she developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo>, which later stabilized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance angiography revealed anomalous intracranial venous drainage, which led to development of her <z:hpo ids='HP_0000238'>hydrocephalus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Various authors described such a process in the 1970s and 1980s, interpreting it as a variant of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome</z:e>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0008913'>listing</z:mp> it with other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">neurocutaneous syndromes</z:e> associated with vascular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027960" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">nevi</z:e>, but few references to this condition appear in the recent literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We think it exists as a syndrome, and that it is not a variant of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cutaneous anomaly has characteristics closer to those of vascular birthmarks that fade than those of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001052'>port wine stain</z:hpo> itself, and seems a direct consequence of abnormal venous drainage rather than a primarily capillary malformation </plain></SENT>
