<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The authors present a patient who experienced late (5-year follow-up) morphological progression of a dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the distal basilar artery after treatment with a combined microsurgical and neuroendovascular Hunterian strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition to postulating about the possible reasons underlying the evolution of this lesion, the role of stenting is discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE DESCRIPTION: The patient was 37 years old when she suffered a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> from spontaneous basilar <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">artery dissection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At the time of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, minimal aneurysmal enlargement was noted angiographically, and she was therefore treated nonoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On reimaging 5 months later, massive enlargement of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patient was treated with staged bilateral vertebral artery sacrifice using a combination of microsurgical and neuroendovascular techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The dominant vertebral artery was clip-ligated distal to the posteroinferior cerebellar artery, whereas the contralateral vertebral artery was coil-occluded cervically 1 week later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Despite the patient remaining asymptomatic, follow-up angiography 5 years after the initial <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> revealed further enlargement of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> as well as a newly discovered inferiorly projecting daughter sac measuring 5 mm in diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Clearly, certain <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> exist for which indirect approaches involving hemodynamic attenuation fail to prevent progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>With greater refinements in stent technology, such lesions may be more effectively treated </plain></SENT>
