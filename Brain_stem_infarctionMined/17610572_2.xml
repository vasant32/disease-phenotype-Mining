<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We now provide a developmental mouse model of neonatal HEB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used <z:chebi fb="2" ids="26536">retinoic acid</z:chebi> (RA) (0.5-10 mg/kg of maternal weight) to alter embryonic development of the respiratory neuronal network at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of hindbrain segmentation (7.5 days post-coitum) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HEB was observed in vivo after RA treatment during post-natal days 1-7 but not in control animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>HEB persisted after reduction of the chemoafferent input by hypocapnic <z:mp ids='MP_0002319'>hyperoxia</z:mp> (100% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A large increase and decrease of the rhythm resembling an HEB episode was induced in vitro by stimulating the parafacial respiratory oscillator in treated but not in control neonates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Post-natal localization of the superior cerebellar peduncle and adjacent dorsal tegmentum was found to be abnormal in the pons of RA-treated juvenile mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, early developmental specifications in the rostral hindbrain are required for the development of neurones that stabilize the function of the respiratory rhythm generator, thereby preventing HEB during post-natal maturation </plain></SENT>
