<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sixty-eight per cent have a superficial, embryological venous channel on the lateral aspect of the limb, 25 per cent have had one or more severe spontaneous haemorrhages from dilated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_99'>varices</z:mpath> and 22 per cent have suffered a venous thrombo-embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-nine per cent have had episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002573'>rectal bleeding</z:hpo> or haematuria associated with pelvic <z:mp ids='MP_0002947'>angiomas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Foot volumetry (n = 31) showed that calf emptying was decreased in only five patients and only one of these had phlebographic evidence of deep venous obstruction, which conflicts with previous findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The rate of calf refilling was increased in 81 per cent and phlebography demonstrated incompetent communicating veins in 45 per cent of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No patient had clinical evidence of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0004947'>arteriovenous fistula</z:hpo>, and arteriography (n = 22) and calf blood flow (n = 33) were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, but lymphangiography (n = 14) showed lymphatic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> in 55 per cent of limbs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eighty-eight operations have been performed on 38 patients but symptoms persist in 90 per cent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We suggest that surgery should be limited to the excision of localized symptomatic abnormalities and that the best form of control is provided by graduated compression stockings </plain></SENT>
