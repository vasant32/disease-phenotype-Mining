<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifteen children (age: 0.9-10 years) with unilateral SWS underwent high-resolution PWI and FDG PET prospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Regional (lobar) asymmetry indices (AIs) of subcortical white matter (WM) cerebral blood flow (CBF) were correlated with corresponding cortical FDG uptake asymmetries, extent of leptomeningeal vascular malformation and clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Abnormal cortical <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism and/or subcortical WM CBF were seen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> lobes affected by vascular malformation and extended to lobes not affected by abnormal pial vessels in 6 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lower CBF was associated with lower cortical <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism in the temporal, parietal and occipital lobes (p≤0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>While decreased perfusion was associated with hypometabolism in most cases, increased regional CBF (found in 6 patients) was commonly associated with relatively mild or no hypometabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ten of 24 cerebral lobes with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism in the affected hemisphere showed abnormal perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>High <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> frequency was associated with severe parieto-occipital hypoperfusion (p≤0.03), while long duration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> was related to frontal lobe hypometabolism (p=0.015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Regional perfusion and cortical <z:mp ids='MP_0005266'>metabolic abnormalities</z:mp> can extend beyond lobes affected by leptomeningeal vascular malformations and are related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> in SWS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Despite a general correlation between perfusion and metabolism, increased WM perfusion with preserved cortical metabolism in overlying cortex is a common pattern of a perfusion/metabolic mismatch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This may represent a disease stage where cortical function is preserved while increased WM perfusion provides collateral drainage of cortex via the deep vein system </plain></SENT>
