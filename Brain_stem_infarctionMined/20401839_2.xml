<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The clinical and angiographic variables of VA dissections were evaluated to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of endovascular intervention in treatment of VA dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL and METHODS: 25 patients with 27 VAdissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were treated with endovascular intervention during the last 10 years.17 patients were admitted with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>23 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> treated using destructive endovascular trapping, while reconstructive techniques were used in 3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> treated with stent-assisted coiling and one <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> treated with false lumen embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The right VA was involved in 14 patients, the left VA in 9 patients, while 2 patients had bilateral VA dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The pearl and string sign was the commonest angiographic sign in 12 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Perioperative complications included; rebleeding in one patient, symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521542" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain stem infarction</z:e> in two patients and silent cerebellar ischemic lesion in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Afavorable outcome was evident more in patients with unruptured VA dissection (100%) versus (76.5%) in patients presented with SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The endovascular technique should be individualized according to the clinical status of the patient, angiographic variables, condition of the posterior circulation and the available supplies </plain></SENT>
