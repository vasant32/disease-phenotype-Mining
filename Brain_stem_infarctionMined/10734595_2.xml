<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since frequently no isolated source of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> is identified, severe blood loss can result in a critical condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This article describes an unusual multimodal treatment concept for a patient with Klippel-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Tr</z:e>énaunay syndrome associated with severe recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002573'>rectal bleeding</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We present the case of a 39-year-old patient with Klippel-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Tr</z:e>énaunay syndrome and a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002573'>rectal bleeding</z:hpo> since childhood requiring multiple blood transfusions over the years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>He was referred to our department in a state of continuous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002573'>rectal bleeding</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Preoperative work-up revealed a complete alteration of the rectum and the distal parts of the sigmoid/colon by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001028'>hemangiomas</z:hpo>, with diffuse <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> from the destroyed rectal mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Preoperatively the superior rectal artery was embolized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After a 48-h interval, sphincter-preserving complete rectal excision including the sigmoid/colon was performed followed by a colon pouch anal anastomosis and protective loop ileostomy </plain></SENT>
