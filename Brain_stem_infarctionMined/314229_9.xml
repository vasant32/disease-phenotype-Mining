<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Stimulation immediately resulted in autonomic reactions and behavioural arousal reactions during the periods of stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Longterm effect consisted of a rise in the level of clinical responsiveness for a period of seven weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A preexistent severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> disappeared completely after one week of stimulation and returned after seven weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results are discussed on the basis of the pathoanatomical findings and of the physiological functions of the damaged as well as of the stimulated areas </plain></SENT>
