<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We prospectively evaluated 66 patients, aged 50 years and older (median 67 years, range 50-85), with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> isolated ocular motor <z:hpo ids='HP_0009831'>mononeuropathies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our purpose was to evaluate both the role of neuroimaging and the role of clinical assessment in determining etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that clinical features, including time to maximal diplopic symptoms, were not predictive of etiology (median 2 days to maximal diplopic symptoms for both peripheral microvascular and other etiologies) </plain></SENT>
