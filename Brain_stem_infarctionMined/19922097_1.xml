<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To assess whether percutaneous embolization is effective for the treatment of intractable <z:hpo ids='HP_0000421'>epistaxis</z:hpo> and JNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-eight patients with intractable posterior <z:hpo ids='HP_0000421'>epistaxis</z:hpo> treated by embolization (25 males; m = 59.78 years; SD = 14.3) and 28 unembolized patients (24 males; m = 59.21 years; SD = 15.13) were studied retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eight patients with JNA (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> males; mean = 16.5 years; SD = 2.35; four embolized before surgery and four unembolized) were also analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Embolization was bilateral in 71.4% of subjects, blood transfusion was required in 28.57%, incidence of complications was 53.57%, and seven of the embolized patients with intractable <z:hpo ids='HP_0000421'>epistaxis</z:hpo> suffered from recurrence of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000421'>epistaxis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no statistically significant differences between the embolized and unembolized groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean hospital stay was longer in unembolized patients (4.46 days; SD = 2.42) than for the embolized patients (3.78 days; SD = 3.9), p=0.394 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most serious complications occurred in patients embolized with idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000421'>epistaxis</z:hpo> and the mean post-embolization hospital stay was longer in this subgroup (4.14 days; SD = 4.39) than in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039445" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Rendu-Osler-Weber syndrome</z:e> (2.40 days; SD = 1.140), p=0.395 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Unembolized patients with JNA presented greater <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> (m = 2025 ml; SD = 325) and a longer mean hospital stay (m = 18 days; SD = 3) than the group of embolized patients (m = 360 ml; SD = 185 and m = 9 days; SD = 1, respectively) </plain></SENT>
