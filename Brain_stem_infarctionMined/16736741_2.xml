<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whether sildenafil <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50744">citrate</z:chebi> may be helpful for recovery in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> is unknown at this time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A 41-year-old woman with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023944" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">locked-in syndrome</z:e> due to pontine infarction began receiving 150 mg of oral sildenafil <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50744">citrate</z:chebi> daily on a compassionate use basis in August 2003 and continues treatment at this time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Magneto-encephalography (MEG) was performed at 12 and 17 months after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No serious adverse events have occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Significant milestone recoveries including standing, use of both arms, talking, and full return of swallowing have occurred, particularly after nine months of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The MEG showed a significantly increased amplitude in the somatosensory cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Daily use of high dose sildenafil <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50744">citrate</z:chebi> appears to be safe in this patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> resulting in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023944" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">locked-in syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further studies will be required to establish safety and efficacy </plain></SENT>
