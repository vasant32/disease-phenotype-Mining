<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Capillary malformation (CM), or "<z:hpo ids='HP_0001052'>port-wine stain</z:hpo>," is a common cutaneous vascular anomaly that initially appears as a red macular stain that darkens over years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CM also occurs in several combined vascular anomalies that exhibit <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath>, such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022739" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="KTS">Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome</z:e>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505,C0022739" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Parkes Weber syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Occasional familial segregation of CM suggests that there is genetic susceptibility, underscored by the identification of a large locus, CMC1, on chromosome 5q </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We used genetic fine mapping with polymorphic markers to reduce the size of the CMC1 locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A positional candidate gene, RASA1, encoding p120-RasGAP, was screened for mutations in 17 families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Heterozygous inactivating RASA1 mutations were detected in six families manifesting atypical CMs that were multiple, small, round to oval in shape, and pinkish red in color </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition to CM, either <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformation</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004947'>arteriovenous fistula</z:hpo>, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505,C0022739" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Parkes Weber syndrome</z:e> was documented in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the families with a mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We named this newly identified association caused by RASA1 mutations "CM-<z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp>," for capillary malformation-<z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0003812'>phenotypic variability</z:hpo> can be explained by the involvement of p120-RasGAP in signaling for various growth factor receptors that control proliferation, migration, and survival of several cell types, including vascular endothelial cells </plain></SENT>
