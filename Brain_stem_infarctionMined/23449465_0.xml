<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The most frequent clinical manifestation of HHT is <z:hpo ids='HP_0000421'>epistaxis</z:hpo>.In 2010 (January-December inclusive) 51 patients with HHT were admitted to the ENT ward of our hospital for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000421'>epistaxis</z:hpo>, and in accordance with routine protocols, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 51 underwent abdominal ultrasonography in our department to detect hepatovascular lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They included 27 males (53%) and 24 (47%) females ranging in age from 11 to 86 years (mean 48.5 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The sample was selected in an arbitrary manner to take maximum advantage of the hospital stay and monitor patients from regions other than our own.Retrospective analysis of the findings from these sonographic examinations revealed hepatic HHT in 27 (53%) of the 51 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nineteen (70%) of these (age range 40-86 years, mean 63) had vascular malformations of various dimensions but no <z:hpo ids='HP_0001409'>portal hypertension</z:hpo>; the other eight (30%) (age range 39-81 years, mean 60) had vascular malformations plus <z:hpo ids='HP_0001409'>portal hypertension</z:hpo>.Our retrospective analysis indicates that a significant number of patients can have unrecognized hepatic involvement; that the appearance of hepatic lesions can be fairly unpredictable, even when the HHT has been diagnosed for years and the patients are already symptomatic; and that the hepatic lesions are frequently progressive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, regular sonographic follow-up is advisable for patients with HHT.The limitations of this study are related to the small number of patients examined and to the fact that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of them were symptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further study is therefore needed (especially in asymptomatic patients) to define the indications for hepatic sonography and the optimum examination schedule </plain></SENT>
