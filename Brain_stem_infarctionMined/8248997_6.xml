<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Persistent primitive proatlantal intersegmental artery (proatlantal artery I) is an anastomotic channel between the carotid and vertebrobasilar arterial systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Persistence of this embryonic anastomosis is very rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The "top of the basilar" syndrome is usually due to occlusion of thalamoperforating arteries by emboli that rise from the vertebrobasilar arterial system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this case, however, the emboli stemmed from atherosclerotic plaques in the carotid system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CASE DESCRIPTION: A 55-year-old woman was hospitalized with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0455718" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">top of the basilar syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A brain scan showed hypodense lesions extending from the mesencephalon to both thalami </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Digital subtraction angiography of the cerebral circulation was performed, which revealed a proatlantal artery I on the left side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, atheromatous plaques were seen along the internal and common carotid arteries on the same side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The occurrence of proatlantal artery I is extremely rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0455718" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Top of the basilar syndrome</z:e> is also rarely encountered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, this is the first report of a patient with both conditions </plain></SENT>
