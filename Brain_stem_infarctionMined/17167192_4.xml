<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Combined functional MRI (fMRI) and diffusion tensor tractography (DTT) imaging provides a powerful vehicle for the investigation of motor recovery mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using this combined method, we investigated the motor recovery mechanism in patients with pontine <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: We evaluated six healthy control subjects and two patients with pontine <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> at 6 months from <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>fMRI was performed at 1.5 T with timed hand grasp-release movements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For DTT, we used each of the 32 noncollinear diffusion-sensitizing gradients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three-dimensional reconstructions of the fiber tracts were obtained with FA &lt;0.3, angle &gt;45 degrees as termination criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: fMRI data revealed activation only in the contralateral primary sensorimotor cortex during movement of either hand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DTI findings from controls and the unaffected hemisphere of the patients showed that the corticospinal tract descended through the known corticospinal tract pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the tracts of the affected hemisphere in the patients were observed to pass along peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> areas (patient 1: lateral, patient 2: posterior) in the pons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: It seems that the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> areas compensate for corticospinal tract damage at the pons; this may be one mechanism of motor recovery for patients with pontine <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
