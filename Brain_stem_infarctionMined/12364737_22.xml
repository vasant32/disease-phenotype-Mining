<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The goal of this study was to determine safety and long-term outcome of the excimer laser-assisted high-flow extracranial/intracranial (EC/IC) bypass in patients with symptomatic carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (CAO) at high risk of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a prospectively collected cohort of 103 patients with symptomatic CAO, 15 patients were selected for excimer laser-assisted EC/IC bypass surgery on the basis of predefined selection criteria: (1) transient or moderately disabling symptoms of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, not symptoms of the retina only; (2) continuing symptoms after documentation of the CAO; (3) evidence of a possible hemodynamic origin of symptoms; and (4) informed consent of the patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eleven patients underwent the operation without complications One patient had a severely disabling <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (Rankin grade 4) 11 days after the operation; the bypass was found occluded on reoperation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two other patients had a moderately disabling <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (Rankin grade 3) immediately after the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One patient died of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> 1 day after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median follow-up time was 27 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the 11 patients who underwent the operation without complications, 1 died 17 months after the operation of a brainstem <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and another patient had a new <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> ipsilateral to his CAO 10 months after the operation but without a change in Rankin grade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The excimer laser-assisted high-flow EC/IC bypass operation is a potentially promising procedure in patients with symptomatic CAO and a presumably high risk of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, but the procedure carries a definite risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This risk is probably related not only to the procedure itself but also to the selection of patients </plain></SENT>
