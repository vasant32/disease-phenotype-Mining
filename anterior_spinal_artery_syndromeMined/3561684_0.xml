<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Six months prior to admission, he noticed tingling sensation of the left 2nd, 3rd and 4th fingers and motor <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> of the left hand, both of which gradually progressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On admission, positive neurological findings were neck pain on dorsal extension, left <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> more advanced in the upper limb, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003700'>diffuse muscle atrophy</z:hpo> of the left upper limb, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001347'>hyperreflexia</z:hpo> of the left upper and lower limbs with positive <z:hpo ids='HP_0003487'>Babinski sign</z:hpo> and dysesthesia corresponding to the left C3-T5 sensory dermatomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Enhanced CT and Metrizamide CT myelography showed a large extra- and intra-dural mass from the C1 segment to the medulla oblongata on the left </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Angiography disclosed a fusiform <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the left vertebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Proximal ligation of the left vertebral artery was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Postoperatively, clinical signs were markedly improved and shrinkage of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was demonstrated on postoperative Metrizamide CT myelogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003700'>diffuse muscle atrophy</z:hpo> of the left upper limb was undetermined, but was probably not due to disturbance of the anterior spinal artery because of good visualization of the artery on the angiogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Indication of the proximal ligation of the vertebral artery with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was discussed </plain></SENT>
