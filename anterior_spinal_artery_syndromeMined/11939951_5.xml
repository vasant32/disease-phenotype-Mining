<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A patient who developed isolated brachial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221165" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diplegia</z:e> following cardiac surgery is described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The underlying cerebral lesion could not be localized using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Evoked potentials disclosed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> findings, while pathological latencies were seen on cortical magnetic stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Their marked improvement over the following year was accompanied by almost complete clinical recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The preserved arm reflexes, together with the observed slow firing motor units in electromyography argued against bilateral lesions of the brachial plexus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We attribute the observed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221165" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diplegia</z:e> to a medullary lesion at the level of the pyramidal decussation, presumably caused by an intraoperative embolic occlusion of the anterior spinal artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cruciate <z:hpo ids='HP_0003470'>paralysis</z:hpo> and man-in-barrel-syndrome (MIBS) both are terms used to describe brachial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221165" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diplegia</z:e>; cruciate <z:hpo ids='HP_0003470'>paralysis</z:hpo> when caused by medullary lesions, MIBS when caused either by supratentorial or by medullary lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Exclusive use of the term MIBS for bilateral frontal lobe lesions, as in the original description, would provide more clarity in terminology </plain></SENT>
