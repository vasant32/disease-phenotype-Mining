<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report our experience with 27 (22 male and 5 female) patients who were from 16 to 82 years of age (median 29 years) who underwent surgical repair for traumatic pseudoaneurysm of the thoracic aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cause of injury in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases was blunt trauma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Repair was accomplished with partial bypass by means of a roller pump with systemic heparinization in 6 (23%), Gott shunt in 7 (27%), clamp-and-sew technique in 6 (23%), and centrifugal pump without systemic heparinization in 8 (30%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Significant postoperative complications occurred in 12 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0010550'>Paraplegia</z:hpo> occurred in 1 patient (clamp and sew), anterior spinal cord syndrome in 1 (clamp and sew), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo> in 1 (Gott shunt), temporary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001605'>vocal cord paralysis</z:hpo> in 2 (Gott shunt, centrifugal pump), permanent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001605'>vocal cord paralysis</z:hpo> in 1 (roller pump), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003256'>coagulopathy</z:hpo> in 2 (centrifugal pump, Gott shunt) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hospital mortality occurred in 5 of 27 (19%), (1 clamp and sew, 1 Gott shunt, 1 centrifugal pump, 2 roller pump) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Follow-up of survivors (1 week to 20 years, median 2.1 years) revealed no further problems from either aortic graft or primary repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although patient numbers are small, evaluation of each of the four surgical techniques leads us to favor repair with shunting with a centrifugal pump without <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The potential advantage of left atrial-left femoral artery shunt with centrifugal pump support was evident in operative field exposure, afterload reduction, avoidance of clamp injury, and maintenance of stable distal aortic perfusion without <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
