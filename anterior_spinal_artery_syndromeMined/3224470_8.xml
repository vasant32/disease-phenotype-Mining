<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Three patients with multiple articular deformities due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002804'>arthrogryposis multiplex congenita</z:hpo> (AMC) are presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> had severe thalamic and tegmental degenerations with glial scars and shrunken ferruginated neurons; one had also unilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002132'>porencephaly</z:hpo> and polymicrogyri </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The character and the pattern of the lesions were highly suggestive of in-utero hypotensive/ischemic insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Marked attenuations of anterior spinal roots were mostly seen in the lumbosacral and cervical enlargements, where <z:hpo ids='HP_0002398'>anterior horn cell loss</z:hpo> and ferrugination were most severe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The changes in the anterior horns were situated peripherally, a distribution corresponding to the terminal ramifications of the sulcal (central) branches of the anterior spinal artery, an area known for its susceptibility to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, especially in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The changes in the brains and spinal cords could reasonably be explained on the basis of intra-uterine perfusion failure in early stages of fetal development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This assumption was supported by the fact that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three patients were subjected to unfavorable environmental factors during gestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The first was the twin of a macerated infant; their entangled umbilical cords might have caused differential placental perfusion resulting in partial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in the twin with AMC and severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in the other accounting for its early demise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The second patient had a single functional umbilical artery, a condition frequently associated with developmental anomalies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The third was born to a mother whose pregnancy was complicated by heavy <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740858" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">substance abuse</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002196'>myelopathy</z:hpo> during a critical phase of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> developmental and muscle innervation is proposed as a cause of some cases of neuropathic AMC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Placental circulatory failure should be considered in the pathogenesis of AMC in such cases </plain></SENT>
