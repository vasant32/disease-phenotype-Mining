<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>When the cervical spine is involved, breathing disorders may be observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To describe the polysomnographic findings in a patient with cervical <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> syndrome complicated by a sleep breathing disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Unit of neurology at a sleep center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patient A 30-year-old man had an ischemic lesion that affected the anterior cervical spinal cord (C2-C6) bilaterally because of an <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>He developed <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> syndrome associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>respiratory impairment</z:hpo> during sleep </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The polysomnographic study during sleep showed a severe sleep disruption caused by continuous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002871'>central apneas</z:hpo> that appeared immediately after falling asleep </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment by intermittent positive pressure ventilation normalized the respiratory pattern and sleep architecture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The sleep breathing pattern was compatible with central <z:hpo ids='HP_0002791'>alveolar hypoventilation</z:hpo> due to automatic breathing control failure caused by a lesion of the reticulospinal pathway, which normally activates ventilatory muscles during sleep </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This autonomic sleep breathing impairment resembles that found as a complication in patients who undergo spinothalamic tract cervical cordotomy for intractable pain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This surgical complication is known as the Ondine curse </plain></SENT>
