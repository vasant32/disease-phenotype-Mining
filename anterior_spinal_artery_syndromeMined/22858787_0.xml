<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: A case report </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We report a case of delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221069" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">anterior spinal artery syndrome</z:e> after repair of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001680'>aortic coarctation</z:hpo> in which the symptoms did not appear until 6 months after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Residual <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of the anterior spinal artery after surgery can mimic a dilated intraspinal vein, which could lead to the erroneous diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002390'>spinal arteriovenous malformation</z:hpo> as the cause for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221069" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">anterior spinal artery syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A 40-year-old man with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> underwent surgical bypass of the left subclavian artery to descending thoracic aorta to treat coarctation of the thoracic aorta and had an uncomplicated postoperative course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Six months later, he developed numbness and <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> in his hands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance image showed abnormal signal within the cervicothoracic spinal cord and prominent flow voids within the ventral spinal canal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Spinal digital subtraction angiography revealed slow flow in a dilated intraspinal vessel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Given the history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001680'>aortic coarctation</z:hpo> repair, the possibility that this represented a residually dilated anterior spinal artery rather than an <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformation</z:hpo> was considered and confirmed on magnetic resonance imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In our patient, institution of an anticoagulation medication regime resulted in rapid improvement of neurological symptoms, underscoring the importance of the awareness of this phenomenon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221069" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">anterior spinal artery syndrome</z:e> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001680'>aortic coarctation</z:hpo> repair because of anterior spinal artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> can manifest even 6 months postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Careful analysis of pre- and postoperative cross-sectional imaging should provide the correct diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Spinal digital subtraction angiography is probably unnecessary and must be interpreted with caution </plain></SENT>
