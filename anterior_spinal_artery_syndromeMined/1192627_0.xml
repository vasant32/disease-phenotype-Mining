<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The true incidence of spinal cord injury as a complication of elective anterior discectomy and interbody fusion is not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It would appear that the risk of encountering this complication increases if the surgical procedure includes instrumentation within the spinal canal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 5 of the cases reported herein the cause for spinal cord injury was identifiable; in the remaining 5, the mechanism of injury is either obscure or not reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 10 patients reported had their surgery performed using the drill and dowel technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The role of the posterior osteophyte in <z:mp ids='MP_0004684'>spondylosis</z:mp> and the rationale for routinely entering the spinal canal in order to decompress the spinal cord and nerve roots are examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Since the majority of refractory disk problems that require surgery can be satisfactorily managed by discectomy and interbody fusion alone, routine instrumentation within the spinal canal may be an avoidable hazard in the majority of instances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The pathogenesis and prognosis of the anterior cord syndrome is reviewed, a possible etiology is suggested, and the <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp>, the autonomy and the importance of the anterior spinal artery system are noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Its vulnerability in the treatment of degenerative disk disease and a possible mechanism for its occult impairment is mentioned </plain></SENT>
