<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Since the introduction of threaded devices in the mid-1990s, anterior lumbar interbody fusion (ALIF) has become a staple in the armamentarium of the spine surgeon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The procedure, however, is heavily dependent on the ability of the approach surgeon to provide exposure quickly and safely in view of a reported incidence of vascular injury as high as 15% and 2.3% incidence of retrograde ejaculation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: This study describes a mini-open approach to the lumbar spine and discusses the results and the complications seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: The study was designed to evaluate patients for possible complications of the approach while they were in the hospital undergoing ALIF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They were also followed for 6 months after the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENT SAMPLE: A total of 686 approaches to the lumbar spine performed on 684 patients between August 1997 and December 2000 were reviewed concurrently and retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>OUTCOME MEASURES: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> complications of the approach were reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These included vascular injury, retrograde ejaculation, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep vein thrombosis</z:hpo> (DVT), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034065" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary emboli</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, wound disruption/<z:hpo ids='HP_0100790'>hernia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002595'>ileus</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, peripheral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, rectus muscle <z:hpo ids='HP_0003470'>paralysis</z:hpo>, aborted cases and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The patients were observed in the perioperative period and for 6 months postoperatively to determine the occurrence of complications related to the approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The data collected included age, weight, gender, levels approached, time of completion of the approach, size of incision and complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were six arterial injuries (0.8%), six venous injuries (0.8%) and one instance of retrograde ejaculation (0.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In addition, there were seven cases that developed DVT (two ileofemoral and five calf-popliteal, 1.0%), four cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002595'>ileus</z:hpo> lasting more than 3 days (0.6%), three wound <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> above the fascia (0.4%), two <z:hpo ids='HP_0100790'>hernias</z:hpo> and two <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009492" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">compartment syndromes</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was one <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> and one <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No rectus muscle <z:hpo ids='HP_0003470'>paralysis</z:hpo> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This experience suggests that a well-planned small incision that preserves the musculature can be performed quickly and safely to allow the spine surgeon adequate access to the anterior lumbar spine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The learning curve, however, can be high even for experienced surgeons </plain></SENT>
