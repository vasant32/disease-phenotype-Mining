<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to describe the preoperative topography of the Adamkiewicz artery and the blood supply of the lumbosacral spinal cord in patients who underwent spinal surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The relevance for anterior approaches of the thoracolumbar spine was then analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred consecutive spinal angiographies were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Surgical indications were: 26 vertebrectomies, 30 anterior fusions in fractures, 13 malunions, 16 anterior releases in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo>, 11 pedicle subtraction osteotomies and 4 thoracic disc <z:hpo ids='HP_0100790'>hernias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The level and the side of the Adamkiewicz artery and the presence of additional radiculomedullary arteries were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Modifications of surgical planning owing to the Adamkiewicz artery were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The Adamkiewicz artery was always located between T8 and L3, at T9 or T10 in 50%, and coming from the left side in 75% of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additional radiculomedullary arteries were found in 43% of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A concordance between the topography of the Adamkiewicz artery and the planned surgical approach was noted in 15%, which led to ten side changings and three modifications of surgical technique with segmental vessel preservation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>An ischemic syndrome of the anterior spinal cord did not occur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0752130" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Spinal cord ischemia</z:e> is rarely reported after segmental vessel ligation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Spinal angiography allows determining the topography of the Adamkiewicz artery safely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>If the planned surgical approach is located at the same level, a contralateral approach or selective surgical techniques without vessel ligation could avoid possible damage to the Adamkiewicz artery if the pathology does not dictate the side and the extent of the surgical approach </plain></SENT>
