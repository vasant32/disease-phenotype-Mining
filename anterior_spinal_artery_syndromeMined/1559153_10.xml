<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We present three patients with a nontraumatic cervical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221069" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">anterior spinal artery syndrome</z:e>, two of whom developed painful burning dysaesthesias below the level of spinal cord lesion, refractory to opiate, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">anticonvulsant</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="36809">tricyclic antidepressant</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Quantitative sensory testing and neurophysiological assessment showed absence of pain and temperature sensation below the level of the lesion, with preservation of light touch, vibratory and position sensibilities and cortical somatosensory evoked potentials in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Dysaesthesias in both affected patients were exacerbated by somatosensory input attributed to intact posterior column function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Posterior column electrical stimulation worsened the dysaesthesias in one affected patient, and was ineffective in the other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both patients affected with dysaesthesias showed significant improvement in motor function and developed clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001257'>spasticity</z:hpo>, while the third patient developed neither dysaesthesias nor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001257'>spasticity</z:hpo>, but remained flaccid without motor improvement, suggesting a more complete lesion of anterolateral spinal pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These cases illustrate that lesions of the anterolateral spinal cord may lead to the development of dysaesthesias, perhaps related in part to selective neospinothalamic deafferentation and preservation of the posterior columns </plain></SENT>
