<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Obstruction of the third part of the duodenum by the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) can occur following surgical correction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The condition most commonly occurs in significantly underweight patients with severe deformities during the first few days to a week following spinal surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE PRESENTATION: We present the atypical case of a patient with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> body habitus and a 50 degrees adolescent idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002944'>thoracolumbar scoliosis</z:hpo> who underwent anterior spinal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003881,C0003090" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality;Therapeutic or Preventive Procedure" abbrv="">arthrodesis</z:e> with instrumentation and developed SMA syndrome due to progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> several weeks postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The condition manifested with recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003270'>abdominal distension</z:hpo>, marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0001944'>dehydration</z:hpo>, and severe electrolyte disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Prolonged nasogastric decompression and nasojejunal feeding resulted in resolution of the symptoms with no recurrence at follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The spinal instrumentation was retained and a solid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002948'>spinal fusion</z:hpo> was achieved with good spinal balance in both the coronal and sagittal planes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: SMA syndrome can occur much later than previously reported and with potentially life-threatening symptoms following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> correction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Early recognition of the condition and institution of appropriate conservative measures is critical to prevent the development of severe complications including the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
