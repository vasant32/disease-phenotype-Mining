<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To develop a method for the detection of bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002277'>Horner's syndrome</z:hpo> in patients with bilateral interruption of the cervical sympathetic pathway or widespread <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0259749" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">autonomic neuropathy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Darkness pupil diameters and redilatation times during light reflexes have been recorded with infrared TV pupillometry in 65 healthy subjects, 47 patients with unilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002277'>Horner's syndrome</z:hpo>, and 20 patients with bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002277'>Horner's syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aetiologies of the last group were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271686" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diabetic autonomic neuropathy</z:e> (three cases), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> (four), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0393911" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pure autonomic failure</z:e> (PAF) (four), <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi>-beta-hydroxylase deficiency (two), and one case each of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027889" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="HSAN">hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HSAN</z:e>) type III, carcinomatous sympathetic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442874" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neuropathy</z:e>, familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002459'>dysautonomia</z:hpo>, multiple system <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002986" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Anderson-Fabry disease</z:e>, and anterior spinal artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> at C5,6 and one had had bilateral cervical sympathectomies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Darkness diameters on the affected side were below <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in 12 patients with unilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002277'>Horner's syndrome</z:hpo>, the measurement yielding only 26% sensitivity for detection of the condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By contrast, the time taken to reach three quarter recovery in the light reflex (T3/4) was abnormally prolonged (redilatation lag) in 33 of the same eyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The measurement yielded 70% sensitivity and 95% specificity for detection of the condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 20 cases, diagnosed on clinical grounds as having bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002277'>Horner's syndrome</z:hpo> of various aetiologies, pupil diameters were abnormally small on both sides in five and on one side in three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fourteen of these patients had significant redilatation lag in both eyes, five patients in <z:mp ids='MP_0005163'>one eye</z:mp>, and one patient had it in neither eye </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Measurement of redilatation lag was therefore a more sensitive diagnostic test than pupil diameter in both unilateral and bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002277'>Horner's syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Provided that the pupils are not tonic, bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002277'>Horner's syndrome</z:hpo> can be diagnosed on the basis of redilatation lag </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It occurs clinically in some generalised <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0259749" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">autonomic neuropathies</z:e> and with interruption of the local sympathetic nerve supplies to the two eyes </plain></SENT>
