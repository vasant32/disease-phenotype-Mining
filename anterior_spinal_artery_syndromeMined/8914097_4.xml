<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 60-year-old woman presented with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085292" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">stiff-person syndrome</z:e> (SPS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Treatment with <z:chebi fb="11" ids="49575">diazepam</z:chebi> controlled her painful spasms initially </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two and one-half years after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of SPS, new spells of paroxysmal leg jerking and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apnea</z:hpo> developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A spell was recorded with simultaneous video and polygraphic techniques that revealed simultaneous firing of motor unit potentials in several muscles (paraspinal, internal hamstring, and abdominal muscles) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>Apnea</z:hpo> was associated with arterial oxygen desaturation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An increase in the dose of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="49575">diazepam</z:chebi> decreased the number and severity of these episodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seventeen months later, the patient began to taper the <z:chebi fb="11" ids="49575">diazepam</z:chebi> dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Shortly thereafter, she had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0006543'>cardiorespiratory arrest</z:hpo> and subsequently died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Autopsy showed small <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> inflammatory foci in the pancreas (some associated with islets) and findings of diffuse <z:mp ids='MP_0006082'>encephalomyelitis</z:mp> characterized by perivascular cuffing in the spinal cord, brainstem, thalamus, hippocampus, and amygdala and a dense mononuclear infiltrate in the anterior horns of the lumbar and cervical cord, with relative preservation of axons and myelin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Cell typing showed this infiltrate was polyclonal and reactive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There have been rare cases of SPS associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0006082'>encephalomyelitis</z:mp> reported previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although the prolonged course in our patient suggested that SPS may have preceded <z:mp ids='MP_0006082'>encephalomyelitis</z:mp>, the more likely explanation is that the patient had an unusually long course of <z:mp ids='MP_0006082'>encephalomyelitis</z:mp> alone </plain></SENT>
