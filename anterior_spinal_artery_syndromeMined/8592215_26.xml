<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This technique provides direct anatomical decompression of the compressed nerve root by removing the compressive spondylotic spur or disc fragment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The nerve root is decompressed from its origin in the spinal cord to the point at which it passes behind the vertebral artery laterally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because most of the disc within the intervertebral space is undisturbed, a functioning motion segment of the disc remains intact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This technique differs from that of Verbiest in that it does not directly transpose the vertebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Unlike Hakuba's technique, the disc within the intervertebral disc space is not removed </plain></SENT>
