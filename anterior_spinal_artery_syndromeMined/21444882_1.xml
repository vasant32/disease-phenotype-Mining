<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, smoking, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> are important risk factors for IS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, their specific role in CEAD is poorly investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to compare the prevalence of vascular risk factors in CEAD patients versus referents and patients who suffered an IS of a cause other than CEAD (non-CEAD IS) in the multicenter Cervical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">Artery Dissection</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>Ischemic Stroke</z:hpo> Patients (CADISP) study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: The study sample comprised 690 CEAD patients (mean age, 44.2 ± 9.9 years; 43.9% women), 556 patients with a non-CEAD IS (44.7 ± 10.5 years; 39.9% women), and 1170 referents (45.9 ± 8.1 years; 44.1% women) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We compared the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo>, smoking, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> (body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m²) or overweightness (body mass index ≥ 25 kg/m² and &lt;30 kg/m²) between the 3 groups using a multinomial logistic regression adjusted for country of inclusion, age, and gender </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with referents, CEAD patients had a lower prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo> (odds ratio 0.55; 95% confidence interval, 0.42 to 0.71; P&lt;0.0001), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> (odds ratio 0.37; 95% confidence interval, 0.26 to 0.52; P&lt;0.0001), and overweightness (odds ratio 0.70; 95% confidence interval, 0.57 to 0.88; P=0.002) but were more frequently hypertensive (odds ratio 1.67; 95% confidence interval, 1.32 to 2.1; P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> vascular risk factors were less frequent in CEAD patients compared with young patients with a non-CEAD IS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The latter were more frequently hypertensive, diabetic, and current smokers compared with referents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These results, from the largest series to date, suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, although less prevalent than in patients with a non-CEAD IS, could be a risk factor of CEAD, whereas <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo>, and overweightness are inversely associated with CEAD </plain></SENT>
