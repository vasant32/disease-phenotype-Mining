<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We describe an original anterior transcervical-thoracic approach required for a safe exposure and radical resection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007131" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="NSCLC">non-small-cell lung cancer</z:e> that has invaded the cervical structures of the thoracic inlet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Through a large L-shaped anterior cervical incision, after the removal of the internal half of the clavicle, the following steps may be performed: (1) dissection or resection of the subclavian vein; (2) section of the anterior scalenus muscle and resection of the cervical portion of the phrenic nerve, if invaded; (3) exposure of the subclavian and vertebral arteries; (4) dissection of the brachial plexus up to the spinal foramen; (5) section of invaded ribs; and (6) en bloc removal of chest wall and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100526'>lung tumor</z:hpo>, either directly or through an extension of the cervical incision into the deltopectoral groove </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An additional posterior thoracotomy may be required for resection of the chest wall below the second rib </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Between 1980 and 1991, 29 patients underwent radical en bloc resection of the inlet <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, chest wall (ribs 1 and 2), and underlying lung, either through the anterior transcervical approach alone (n = 9) or with an additional posterior thoracotomy (n = 20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The inferior root of the brachial plexus, either alone (n = 11) or with the phrenic nerve (n = 4), was involved and resected in 15 patients (52%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients (41%) had a vascular involvement that included the subclavian artery alone (n = 3); subclavian artery and subclavian vein (n = 3); subclavian artery, subclavian vein, and vertebral artery (n = 2); subclavian artery and vertebral artery (n = 1); subclavian vein alone (n = 1); vertebral artery alone (n = 1), or subclavian artery and vertebral artery (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The subclavian artery was revascularized either with a prosthetic replacement (n = 7) or an end-to-end anastomosis (n = 2), and the median graft patency was 18.5 months (range, 6 to more than 73 months); only 1 patient had postradiotherapy graft occlusion in the revascularized artery 6 months after operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We performed 14 wedge resections, 14 lobectomies, and 1 pneumonectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no operative or hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Postoperative radiotherapy (median, 56 Gy) was given to 25 (86%) patients, either alone (n = 14) or in combination with adjuvant systemic chemotherapy (n = 11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up time of 2.5 years, overall 2- and 5-year survivals were 50% and 31%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This transcervical-thoracic approach affords a safe exposure and radical resection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007131" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="NSCLC">non-small-cell lung cancer</z:e> involving the thoracic inlet and results in encouraging long-term survival </plain></SENT>
