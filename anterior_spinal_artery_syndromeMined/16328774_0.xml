<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There are few data describing the microanatomy of the anterior-ventral spinal (AVSA) and anterior spinal arteries (<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi>) and discussing their clinical and surgical implications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe the anatomical features of this arterial complex, and highlight their use when planning and performing surgical approaches to lesions involving the ventral aspect of the medulla and the foramen magnum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: The microsurgical <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> and branching pattern of the AVSA and the <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> from fifty human cadaver brain stems is described using a surgical microscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found one anterior-ventral spinal artery at each side in 30 of the brain stems (60%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> was a direct branch emerging from the left vertebral artery (VA) in 15 (30%), from the right VA in 4 (8%), and from the basilar artery (BA) in one brain stem (2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The previously described as "typical pattern" of the junction of the AVS arteries from both sides, was observed only in 9 brain stems (18%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The anterior communicating spinal artery (ACoSA) was observed in 15 brain stems (30%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Also multiple ACoS arteries were described in one brain stem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both, the AVSA and the <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> were observed to send long circumferential branches that supplied irrigation to the olive in 42 (84%) brain stems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This anatomical study gives important information for a better understanding of the clinical picture of ischemic lesions of the brain stem, such as the medial medullary syndrome, and highlights the remarkable role of the AVSA and <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> as anatomical landmarks during the surgical approaches to lesions involving the ventral aspect of the medulla and the foramen magnum </plain></SENT>
