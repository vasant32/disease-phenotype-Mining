<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Bow <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026705" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Hunter's syndrome</z:e> is a rare form of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042568" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vertebrobasilar insufficiency</z:e> that may be successfully treated by surgical intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Use of intraoperative dynamic transcranial Doppler ultrasound for surgical treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042568" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vertebrobasilar insufficiency</z:e> has been described in literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, this technique was inconsistent and unreliable in some patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We present a case of a patient with Bow <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026705" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Hunter's syndrome</z:e> treated surgically and emphasize the valuable addition of intraoperative dynamic angiography to determine resolution of vertebral artery compromise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CASE DESCRIPTION: The patient was a 58-year-old man with complaints of dizziness, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002321'>vertigo</z:hpo>, and near-syncopal episodes that occurred when he rotated his head to the left </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Imaging revealed compromise of the dominant left vertebral artery with leftward head rotation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An anterior cervical approach with decompression of the left subaxial vertebral artery was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Significant osteophyte formation was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Removal of bone and decompression of the vertebral artery was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Intraoperative dynamic angiography confirmed resolution of vertebral artery compression and minimized the amount of decompression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No further intervention was required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Intraoperative dynamic angiography is a definitive test to determine hemodynamic resolution of Bow <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026705" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Hunter's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It offers real-time feedback of vertebral artery decompression, potentially minimizes the amount of decompression, and can be performed safely </plain></SENT>
