<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Correction of such consolidated deformities requires major surgery with a combined posterior and anterior approach, aiming to correct bony impingement on neural and vascular structures, reduce deformity and to attain circumferential instrumentation and fusion in physiological alignment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This can be achieved using either a single-staged or a two-staged procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Regardless, this type of major surgery entails considerable neurological risks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, thorough planning of the intervention and considerable surgical experience is needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We present an elderly woman with gross restriction of forward gaze and intractable nuchal and radicular pain due to cervical spine deformity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Her <z:hpo ids='HP_0002947'>cervical kyphosis</z:hpo> was corrected using preoperative skeletal axial traction for four days and subsequent operative reduction with circumferential instrumentation and fusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The post-operative course was complicated by a temporary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221069" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">anterior spinal artery syndrome</z:e> despite <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> intraoperative somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP) and by a wound <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> requiring removal of the implant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, segmental fusion in physiological alignment was successfully achieved and the patient fully recovered from the neurological deficit and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
