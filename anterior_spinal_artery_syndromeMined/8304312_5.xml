<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the incidence of BCS complicated by <z:mp ids='MP_0003331'>HCC</z:mp> was 0.7% of a total of 556 patients who underwent surgery for <z:mp ids='MP_0003331'>HCC</z:mp> or were autopsied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>Hepatitis</z:hpo> B virus-related antigen or antibody was positive in one patient each </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four of our five patients were asymptomatic and were initially diagnosed by ultrasonography (n = 3) or computed tomography (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The hepatic parenchyma histopathological findings were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> in one each </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Membranous obstruction with spotty calcification, intrahepatic bizarre communicating vessels, and the dilated anterior longitudinal veins in spinal canal were recognized in three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three patients had two <z:mp ids='MP_0003331'>HCCs</z:mp> which were similar in size and arose from the right and left hepatic lobe, separately, suggesting multicentricity of <z:mp ids='MP_0003331'>HCC</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both percutaneous transluminal angioplasty with Gruntzig balloon catheters for the obstruction of the inferior vena cava and hepatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332335" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arterial embolization</z:e> for <z:mp ids='MP_0003331'>HCC</z:mp>(s) were performed in three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These patients survived 29.3 months on average after the diagnosis of BCS complicated by <z:mp ids='MP_0003331'>HCC</z:mp>(s) </plain></SENT>
