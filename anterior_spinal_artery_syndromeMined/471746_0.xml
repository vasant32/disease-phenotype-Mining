<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Benign cases are those in which both spinal stability is not affected and only subjective neurovascular complaints are present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Management essentially involves constant volontary immobilization of the cervical spine with or without apparatus (Postural training) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The severity of the sprains results from the possibility of either vertebral instability or objective neurovascular complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Bony instability can be detected on dynamic radiographs based on precise criteria defined by physiologic study of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> spinal movements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When a persistant vascular syndrome involving the vertebro-basilar arteries is observed, vertebral arteriography may be indicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Likewise, the presence of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039984" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thoracic outlet syndrome</z:e> may required sub-clavian arteriography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Metrizamide myelography is used to explore neurologic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The author concluded that only severe cervical sprains required surgical intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850139" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">prolapsed cervical disc</z:e>, revealed by discography and especially metrizamide myelography, most often requires an anterior approach to surgery </plain></SENT>
