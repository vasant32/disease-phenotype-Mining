<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To investigate the risk indicators, pattern of clinical presentation and treatment strategy of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038828" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">superior mesenteric artery syndrome</z:e> (SMAS) after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From July 1997 to October 2003, 640 patients with adolescent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> who had undergone surgical treatment were evaluated prospectively, and among them seven patients suffered from SMAS after operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Each patient was assigned a percentile for weight and a percentile for height </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Values of the 5th, 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 95th percentiles were selected to divide the observations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The sagittal Cobb angle was used to quantify thoracic or <z:hpo ids='HP_0005619'>thoracolumbar kyphosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the seven patients presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo> and intermittent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> about 5 d after operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An upper gastrointestinal <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32594,32595">barium</z:chebi> contrast study showed a straight-line cutoff at the third portion of the duodenum representing extrinsic compression by the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The value of height in the seven patients with SMAS was above the mean of sex- and age-matched <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> population, and the height percentile ranged from 5% to 50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, the value of weight was below the mean of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> population with the weight percentile ranging from 5% to 25% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among the seven patients, four had a thoracic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002808'>hyperkyphosis</z:hpo> ranging from 55 degrees to 88 degrees (average 72 degrees), two had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0005619'>thoracolumbar kyphosis</z:hpo> of 25 degrees and 32 degrees respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The seven patients were treated with fasting, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50919">antiemetic</z:chebi> medication, and intravenous fluids infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Reduction or suspense of traction was adopted in three patients with SMAS during halo-femoral traction after anterior release of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients recovered completely with no sequelae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No one required operative intervention with a laparotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Height percentile &lt; 50%, weight percentile &lt; 25%, sagittal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002808'>kyphosis</z:hpo>, heavy and quick halo-femoral traction after spinal anterior release are the potential risk indicators for SMAS in patients undergoing correction surgery for adolescent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
