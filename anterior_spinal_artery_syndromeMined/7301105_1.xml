<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This report describes the angiographic and autopsy findings of such a variation, which was observed in a 65-year-old man with a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023944" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">locked-in syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The paired trunks of the anterior spinal artery were visualized in a retrograde fashion through the left inferior thyroid artery and a radical branch at the 5th cervical level by left retrograde brachial angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The uppermost segments of either vertebral artery and the lower portion of the basilar artery were opacified through these channels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The autopsy confirmed the paired trunks of the anterior spinal artery, occlusion of the vertebral arteries just caudal to the origin of the main branches of the anterior spinal artery, and an old <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> involving the pontine tegmentum and cerebellum </plain></SENT>
