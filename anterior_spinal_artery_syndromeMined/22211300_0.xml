<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Spinal dural <z:hpo ids='HP_0004947'>arteriovenous fistulas</z:hpo> (DAVF) in the cervical spine are known to cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Vasospasm after rupture of a DAVF, however, has not previously been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE PRESENTATION: A 48-year-old woman who presented with the sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278061" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">altered mental status</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Imaging demonstrated extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> and spinal DAVF at C1 to C2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient underwent a suboccipital craniotomy for DAVF ligation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On post-operative day three, she began having <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> her extremities with proprioception and vibration preserved, whereas pain and temperature sensation was lost </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An angiogram demonstrated bilateral vertebral artery vasospasm with no filling of the anterior spinal artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Bilateral angioplasty of the vertebral arteries was performed successfully and post-angioplasty, the right vertebral artery was filling the anterior spinal artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The patient clinically improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>She subsequently required treatment with n-butyl cyanoacrylic acid (nBCA) embolization and gamma knife radiosurgery to achieve obliteration of the lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: For patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> of unknown origin, differential diagnosis should include DAVF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This patient also presented with vasospasm in the context of ruptured DAVF, a complication previously unreported in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This finding suggests that close monitoring for vasospasm after rupture of DAVF is warranted </plain></SENT>
