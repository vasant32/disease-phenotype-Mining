<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Intraoperative somatosensory evoked potential (SSEP) monitoring has been shown to reduce the incidence of new postoperative neurological deficits in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, its usefulness during cervical spine surgery remains a subject of debate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To determine the utility of intraoperative SSEP monitoring in a specific patient population (those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0742186" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cervical radiculopathy</z:e> in the absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002196'>myelopathy</z:hpo>) who underwent anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENT SAMPLE: A total of 1,039 nonmyelopathic patients who underwent single or multilevel ACDF surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The control group (462 patients) did not have intraoperative SSEP monitoring, whereas the monitored group (577 patients) had continuous intraoperative SSEP monitoring performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>OUTCOME MEASURE: A new postoperative neurological deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>METHODS: SSEP tracings were reviewed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 577 patients in the monitored group and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> significant signal changes were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Medical records were reviewed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 1,039 patients to determine if any new neurological deficits developed in the immediate postoperative period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: None of the patients in the control group had any new postoperative neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the monitored group there were six instances of transient SSEP changes (1 due to suspected carotid artery compression; 5 thought to be due to transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo>) which resolved with the appropriate intraoperative intervention (repositioning of retractors; raising the arterial blood pressure) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Upon waking up from anesthesia, one patient in the monitored group had a new neurological deficit (partial central cord syndrome) despite <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> intraoperative SSEP signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: ACDF appears to be a safe surgical procedure with a low incidence of iatrogenic neurological injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Transient SSEP signal changes, which improved with intraoperative interventions, were not associated with new postoperative neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>An intraoperative neurological deficit is possible despite <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> SSEP signals </plain></SENT>
