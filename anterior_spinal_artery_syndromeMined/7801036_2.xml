<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of ASCI, and particularly of an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221069" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">anterior spinal artery syndrome</z:e> (ASAS) can be confirmed nowadays by MRI, whereas in the past only necropsy confirmation was possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pathophysiology and long-term prognosis may be better known at present and treatments more consistent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We present the longitudinal study and clinical features of 8 patients suffering from ASCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of them were personally studied and had MRI examinations, often with sequential studies. three groups must be considered: one included 4 cases of ASAS at cervical level, the second 2 cases of ASAS at thoracic level and the third group with infarction of the conus medullaris (ICM), one of them developed during surgical repair of an infrarenal <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Motor and sensory sequelae were assessed in each case together with possible etiological factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, recovery after ASAS tends to be dependent on the severity of the initial deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At cervical level, clinical and morphological findings argue in favour of an extrinsic selective compression of the C7 right radiculo-medullary artery as responsible for the <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At thoracic level, the artery preferentially occluded seems to be the sulco-commisural artery as a consequence of disc compression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Finally, an underlying peculiarity of the pattern of arterial supply is a probable predisposing factor for ICM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Generally, the long-term prognosis of ASCI is not necessarily bad </plain></SENT>
