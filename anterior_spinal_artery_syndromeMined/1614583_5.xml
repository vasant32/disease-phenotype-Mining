<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In an initial anatomical study, the positions of the left vagus and glossopharyngeal nerves in the skull were radiographically determined in 10 cadavers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By using a pattern of REZ topography developed from this information, the angiographic findings in 107 hypertensive and 100 normotensive patients were then compared retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 80% of the angiograms of the hypertensive patients that could be evaluated, an artery crossed the left REZ of cranial nerves IX and X </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most frequently, this was the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (35.3% of cases), followed by the vertebral artery (29.4% of cases) and the anterior inferior artery (19.1% of cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 9 cases (13%), both the posterior inferior cerebellar artery and the vertebral artery appeared in the REZ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Frequently, a larger diameter of the left vertebral artery was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The angiograms of normotensive patients that could be evaluated revealed an artery in the REZ in only 34.5% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results support the hypothesis that essential <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> may be associated with neurovascular compression of the left REZ of cranial nerves IX and X </plain></SENT>
