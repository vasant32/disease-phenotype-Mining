<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study began 2 days later after port-A cath implantation and continued during the 12 weeks follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During the investigation, the dosages, pain intensity, side effects, complications, activity and acceptibility were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Initially, the <z:chebi fb="71" ids="17303">morphine</z:chebi> test does(0.2mg) resulted in pain relief for 8-26 hrs (mean 13.4 hrs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Then, changing the <z:chebi fb="71" ids="17303">morphine</z:chebi> dosages or frequency of injections were relied upon the effect of the opiate to provide 24 hrs pain relief </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean <z:chebi fb="71" ids="17303">morphine</z:chebi> requirements were 0.32mg in 1st week, 0.44mg in 4th week, 1.25mg in 8th week and 1.43mg in 12th week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean <z:chebi fb="71" ids="17303">morphine</z:chebi> dose before IT treatment was 36.4mg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The vast majority of patients' pain intensity decreased prominently after IT <z:chebi fb="71" ids="17303">morphine</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>But pain was aggravated in the 12th week although the <z:chebi fb="71" ids="17303">morphine</z:chebi> dose increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Side effects were minimal, and only one patient suffered from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Complications included 8 patients with port-A system dysfunction, one with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221069" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">anterior spinal artery syndrome</z:e>, and one case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0392548" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cauda equina syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Activity improved significantly and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients accepted the kind of treatment though some patients did not experience completely satisfactory relief from pain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Intrathecal <z:chebi fb="71" ids="17303">morphine</z:chebi> therapy uses only small amounts of opiate to achieve the optimal level of pain relief </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>So it offers a beneficial treatment option to patients whose pain has become intolerable or who have poor responsiveness to systemic narcotics </plain></SENT>
