<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Oblique transcorporeal drilling is a new surgical technique in which the transverse foramina with the vertebral artery and lateral aspects of the bodies of the cervical vertebrae are exposed; it allows to drill out obliquely from the antero-lateral to the opposite postero-lateral corner, half of one or several cervical vertebral bodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The technique is shortly described and its indications are discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It can mainly be applied to release osteophytic compression and to remove anteriorly developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The advantages are to work in a wide field with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> important structures kept medially and protected and to keep a sufficient portion of the vertebral bodies to preserve the spine stability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This technique has been used in 39 cases with <z:mp ids='MP_0004684'>spondylosis</z:mp> in 27 cases, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> in 11 cases and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002808'>kyphosis</z:hpo> in 2 cases including one with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_435'>neurofibroma</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results in term of decompression were excellent in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mortality was none and morbidity was limited to a transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0002277'>Horner's syndrome</z:hpo> in almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases and to a CSF leak in three cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This technique is therefore alternative to the anterior transcorporeal approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In our experience, the oblique transcorporeal drilling provides a wider and safer access to lesions located anterior to the spinal cord </plain></SENT>
