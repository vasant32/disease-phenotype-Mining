<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate that during complex reconstructive surgery for <z:hpo ids='HP_0008443'>spinal deformities</z:hpo>, pulmonary artery catheter monitoring identifies a subset of patients with pulmonary injury and is essential in their management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Patients who undergo sequential anterior-posterior thoracolumbosacral surgical corrections for <z:hpo ids='HP_0008443'>spinal deformities</z:hpo> experience significant perioperative morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although the value of pulmonary artery catheter monitoring is controversial, its use in these procedures may help identify potential physiologic complications and improve surgical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were monitored with a pulmonary artery catheter during surgery until at least postoperative day 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Outcome measurements included blood loss, vertebral levels fused, operative time, postoperative respiratory complications, and days in intensive care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eight (8/55; 14.5%) patients according to pulmonary artery catheter monitoring demonstrated elevated pulmonary vascular resistance and noncardiac <z:hpo ids='HP_0100598'>pulmonary edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These patients had longer operative procedures with greater blood loss and had more postoperative respiratory complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>They were treated appropriately in intensive care and discharged without further complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Pulmonary artery catheter monitoring of patients who undergo complex <z:hpo ids='HP_0002948'>spinal fusion</z:hpo> facilitates the identification of patients with pulmonary injury and is essential in the management of these patients in the postoperative period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It may, also, be a marker for embolic injury to the lung </plain></SENT>
