<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Obstruction of the third part of the duodenum by the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) is associated with spinal manipulation in the surgical or conservative management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present study was to investigate the prevalence of SMA syndrome in a cohort of 165 consecutive pediatric patients who underwent spine deformity surgery and had minimum 2-year follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study group comprised 85 patients with idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo>, 20 patients with neuromuscular and 18 patients with miscellaneous or syndromic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo>, and 42 patients with congenital spine deformities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Posterior spine <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003881,C0003090" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality;Therapeutic or Preventive Procedure" abbrv="">arthrodesis</z:e> was performed in 94 patients, combined anteroposterior in 60 patients, and anterior <z:hpo ids='HP_0002948'>spinal fusion</z:hpo> in 11 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified four patients who developed SMA syndrome postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> markedly underweight adolescent girls; two patients had adolescent idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo>, one had neuromuscular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo>, and one congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Third-generation instrumentation systems with derotational effect were used in three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The spine <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003881,C0003090" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality;Therapeutic or Preventive Procedure" abbrv="">arthrodesis</z:e> in the patient with neuromuscular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002650'>scoliosis</z:hpo> was performed using bone graft followed by application of a spinal jacket </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The symptoms developed at a mean of 3.7 days post surgery and included <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo>, increased nasogastric aspirates, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo> and distension </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conservative management with prolonged nasojejunal feedings achieved resolution of the symptoms in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one patient, who required derotation of the duodenum and jejunum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no evidence of recurrence of the condition in any patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of SMA syndrome in our series was 2.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This work draws attention to the significance of the prevention of the condition by recognizing patients who are at a higher risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>An early diagnosis of SMA syndrome will allow for application of conservative methods and will increase the chances for a successful outcome </plain></SENT>
