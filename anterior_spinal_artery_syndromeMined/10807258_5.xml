<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE AND IMPORTANCE: Type IVc <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformations</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp>) of the spinal cord consist of multiple high-flow feeding vessels, and they often present a challenging management situation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Their location is intradural and extramedullary, and they are rare malformations that are difficult to treat owing to the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the anterior spinal artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors report a case of Type IVc spinal <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> in a patient with a family history of three siblings with pulmonary <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Spinal <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp> have been reported to be associated with inherited syndromes such as familial cutaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001028'>hemangiomas</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022521" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Kartagener's syndrome</z:e>, but an association with pulmonary <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp> has not previously been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 27-year-old man presented with sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of occipital <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> with cervical radiation while weightlifting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results of computed tomography of the brain were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, but lumbar puncture revealed a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patient had a 1-year history of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0000011'>neurogenic bladder</z:hpo> and exhibited marked left calf <z:hpo ids='HP_0003202'>muscle wasting</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: The patient underwent spinal magnetic resonance imaging, which revealed the <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> in the conus region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Selective spinal angiography was performed for diagnostic purposes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A laminectomy was performed, and the vessels feeding the <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> were clipped, as was the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The patient remained neurologically stable, and angiography confirmed obliteration of the <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This is the first case report of a patient with a spinal <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> who had multiple siblings with <z:mp ids='MP_0002132'>pulmonary malformations</z:mp> or <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
