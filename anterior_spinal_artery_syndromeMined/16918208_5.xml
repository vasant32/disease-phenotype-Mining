<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To understand the nature of these injuries, a detailed anatomical study and dissection was undertaken in six cadaveric specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Critical structures at risk in the abdomen and retroperitoneum were identified, and their anatomical relationships were categorized and photographed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These structures included the psoas muscle, kidneys, ureters, diaphragm and crura, esophageal hiatus, thoracic duct, greater splanchnic nerves, phrenic nerves, sympathetic chains, medial arcuate ligament, superior and inferior hypogastric plexus, segmental and radicular vertebral vessels, aorta, vena cava, median sacral artery, common iliac vessels, iliolumbar veins, lumbosacral plexus, and presacral hypogastric plexus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Based on these dissections and an extensive review of the literature, the authors provide a detailed anatomically based discussion of the complications associated with anterior lumbar surgery </plain></SENT>
