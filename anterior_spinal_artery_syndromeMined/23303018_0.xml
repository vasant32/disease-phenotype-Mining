<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>There has been a keen interest in assessing the neurovascular <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> of the rostral ventrolateral medulla oblongata (RVLM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was aimed at documenting the complete neurovascular <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> of the RVLM, in order to offer a general picture of the possible offending vessels of this area, which seems to be involved in the pathogeny of the essential <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Noteworthy, syndromes of the last cranial nerves could be due to vascular contacts or compressions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The present study was performed on 20 human adult brainstem-cerebellum blocks, dissected out of the posterior cerebral fossa at autopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The origins of the inferior cerebellar arteries (anterior - AICA and posterior - PICA) were traced bilaterally (n=40 sides) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When present (26÷40) AICA most frequently left the basilar artery and PICA (28÷40) most frequently left the vertebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At the level of the RVLM, a quadrilateral space delimited by the vertebral artery (VA) and the vertebrobasilar junction, the AICA and the PICA, was defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Within that space, three vascular layers were identified: a superficial one, formed by the inferior cerebellar arteries, a middle one, consisting of perforating arteries, and a deep, venous one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The RVLM perforating arteries left the VA (31÷40), basilar artery (BA) (3÷40), anterior spinal artery (<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi>) (34÷40), PICA (28÷40) and AICA (24÷40) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These perforators had a transverse or oblique course if given off by the VA, BA or <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi>, were descendant if given off by the AICA or BA, and were ascending if given off by the VA or PICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Microanatomical studies of the vascular relations of the RVLM are able to complete the somewhat limited findings of studies based on imaging techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The offending vessels of the RVLM could be any of the vessels inside the quadrilateral space </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Major vessels, such as the VA, AICA or PICA should not be viewed as the only possible offending vessels at this level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The perforators and the venous layers in the quadrilateral space should also be better evaluated from this perspective </plain></SENT>
