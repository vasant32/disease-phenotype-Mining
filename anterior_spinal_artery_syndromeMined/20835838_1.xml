<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The sensory fibers of upper cervical nerves have vasodilatatory effect on the anterior spinal arteries (<z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>Subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) causes severe vasospasm by various neurochemical mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We examined whether there is a relationship between the neuron density of the C3 dorsal root ganglion and the severity of <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> vasospasm in SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study was conducted on 20 rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four of them were used as baseline group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Experimental SAH has been applied to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of 16 animals by injecting homologous blood into cisterna magna </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After 20 days of injection, <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> and C3 dorsal root ganglia (C3DRG) were examined histopathologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> volume values and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and degenerated neuron densities of C3DRG were estimated stereologically and the results were analyzed statistically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> volume was 1.050±0.450 mm³, [corrected] and the mean neuronal density of C3DRG was 10,500 ± 850 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mean volume value of <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> was 0.970±0.150 [corrected] mm³, and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> neuron density of C3DRG fell to 8,600 ± 400/mm³ in slight vasospasm group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In severe vasospasm-developed animals, mean volume value of <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> was 0.540±0.90 [corrected]mm³ and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> neuron density of C3DRG fell to 5,500 ± 360/mm³ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>An inverse relationship between the degenerated neuronal density of the C3DRG and <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> volume values may indicate the severity of <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The neuron density of C3DRG may be an important factor on the regulation of <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> volume values and the continuation of spinal cord blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Low neuron density of C3DRG may be considered as an important factor in the pathogenesis of severe <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> vasospasm in SAH </plain></SENT>
