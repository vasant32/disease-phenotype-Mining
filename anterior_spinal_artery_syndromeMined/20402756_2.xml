<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The mechanism and pathogenesis of ischemic spinal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> remain largely undetermined because most clinical studies have included mostly patients without a systematic study of associated vascular and concomitant disease of the vertebral body </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we assessed the pathogenetic mechanisms and short-term outcomes of the patients with spinal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> based on clinical data and magnetic resonance imaging findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied clinical, imaging, and outcome data for 36 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> spinal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> admitted between 1998 and 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were 16 men and 20 women (mean age 73, range 56-85 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twelve patients (33%) had anterior spinal artery patterns, 8 (22%) had anterior and 6 (17%) had posterior unilateral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, 5 (14%) had posterior spinal artery <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> pattern, 3 (8%) had central involvement, and 2 (5%) had transverse syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients (33%) had no cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with central <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and transverse <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> had a high frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>peripheral vascular disease</z:hpo> and prolonged <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo>, and one patient each had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037933" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">spinal disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> was associated with mechanical triggering movements in 12 patients (41%, P&lt;0.05), and with diseases of the spine in 19 (66%; P&lt;0.001), with the clinical picture suggesting root involvement at the level of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0752130" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">spinal cord ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The short-term outcomes were favorable in two-thirds of patients, while 25% of them did not show any recovery on leaving the hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The most common type of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0752130" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">spinal cord ischemia</z:e> is bilateral or unilateral anterior spinal artery <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> due to radicular artery disease with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037933" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">spinal disease</z:e> and followed by central and transverse <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> due to extensive spinal cord hypoperfusion and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arteriopathy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
