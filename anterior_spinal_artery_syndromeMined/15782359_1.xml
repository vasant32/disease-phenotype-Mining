<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: We report the case of an 81-year-old male patient who presented symptoms of sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002385'>paraparesis</z:hpo>, secondary to lesions in the anterior spinal territory and whose diagnosis was reached using conventional spinal cord MRI, and later confirmed with the diffusion imaging technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diffusion MRI in the spinal cord territory, as well as in the brain territory, is a very interesting first choice technique when an ischemic pathology is suspected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using only T2-weighted images does not allow <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischemic lesions to be distinguished from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> lesions; likewise, intramedullary T2 hyperintensity and standard DWI (Diffusion Weighted Imaging) is not specific to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> spinal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, and the determination of the apparent diffusion coefficient in the lesion may help in the differential diagnosis of diseases affecting the spinal cord </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Including diffusion RMI techniques in the study protocols in cases of ischemic spinal cord pathologies is indispensable today if we hope to reach a fast and correct diagnosis </plain></SENT>
