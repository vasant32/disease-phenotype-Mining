<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Decompression of a stressed cervical nerve root is a routine neurosurgical procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Most of the time it is achieved through an anterior approach and, less frequently, through a posterior approach in specific indications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: According to the principles that an anterolateral compression must directly be reached and that working in the vicinity of the vertebral artery is safe under visual control, we developed the anterolateral approach to the cervical intervertebral foramen and the nerve root using a minimally invasive technique to remove the offending process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Microsurgical cervical nerve root decompression by anterolateral approach is a minimally invasive technique, permitting one to remove the offending process staightforwardly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The disc and bone resections are minimal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This method avoids osteoarthrodesis or arthroplasty with disc prosthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This technique is efficient with good results and low morbidity </plain></SENT>
