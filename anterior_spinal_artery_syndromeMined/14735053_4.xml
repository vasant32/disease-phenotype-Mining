<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: Prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010550'>paraplegia</z:hpo>, a serious complication of surgery for thoracoabdominal <z:hpo ids='HP_0004942'>aortic aneurysm</z:hpo>, has been well documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However no assured prophylaxis against this complication has yet been found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Spinal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> is believed to be the major cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010550'>paraplegia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We conducted an experimental study to define the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010550'>paraplegia</z:hpo> with regard to the blood supply to the spinal cord </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A porcine model was used to evaluate blood distribution to the anterior spinal artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Colored silastic agent was selectively injected into the intercostal and lumbar arteries, and distribution to the anterior spinal artery was evaluated on 50 animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The intercostal and lumbar arteries were ligated in the segments where the blood supply to the anterior spinal artery would be interrupted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Whether or not <z:hpo ids='HP_0010550'>paraplegia</z:hpo> developed was checked 2 days later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Colored silastic agent arrived at the anterior spinal artery from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> segments of the 8th intercostal to 4th lumbar arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two of 9 pigs (22.2%) that underwent ligation of the segments from the 9th intercostal to 2(nd) lumbar artery suffered <z:hpo ids='HP_0010550'>paraplegia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In 3 non-paraplegic pigs, colored silastic agent injected into the preserved arteries was found to have covered a wider range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the intercostal and lumbar arteries supplied blood to the anterior spinal artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>When large segments of intercostal and lumbar arteries were ligated, the blood flow from the preserved segments acquired increased dominance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The possibility exists that any intercostal and lumbar artery can supply blood to the spinal cord and become collateral circulation to the anterior spinal artery </plain></SENT>
