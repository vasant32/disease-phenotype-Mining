<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis might be erroneous, because compression in this region might produce signs and symptoms that seem to originate in the lower cervical cord </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This article reviews the clinical presentation and radiographic data of a consecutive series of 11 patients who presented between 1992 and 1994 with an extradural lesion above the C4 level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each patient had a characteristic syndrome of finger and hand dysesthesia, hand <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath>, and occipital or cervical pain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These complaints usually preceded the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001257'>spasticity</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001288'>gait disturbance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Initial diagnoses included <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0700251" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brachial plexopathy</z:e>, shoulder dysfunction, <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> syndrome, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0008480'>cervical spondylosis</z:hpo> at a lower segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0008480'>Cervical spondylosis</z:hpo> or a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242362" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PID">herniated disc</z:e> was the most common pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most commonly involved level was C3-C4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nine patients underwent a surgical procedure; eight showed significant postoperative improvement (mean time of follow-up examination, 9.7 mo; follow-up range, 1-24 mo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One patient was lost to follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although the pathophysiology of these findings is unknown, theories include anterior spinal artery <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, venous obstruction, and differential decussation of the forelimb and hindlimb fibers of the corticospinal tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Recognition of this syndrome might prevent inappropriate operative intervention in patients with coexisting pathological conditions of the lower cervical spinal cord </plain></SENT>
