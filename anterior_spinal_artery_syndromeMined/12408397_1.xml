<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 60-year-old man who had undergone lumbar discectomy 3 years previously for severe left-sided <z:hpo ids='HP_0011868'>sciatica</z:hpo> and L5-S1 disc <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019270" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herniation</z:e> presented with progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001288'>gait disturbance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After the initial surgery, the symptoms resolved </plain></SENT>
