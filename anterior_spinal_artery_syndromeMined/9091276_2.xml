<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most were situated from T6 to T12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were 10 medial <z:hpo ids='HP_0100790'>hernias</z:hpo> and 8 lateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0100790'>hernias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Symptom duration was a mean 23 months at surgery including spinal pain (n = 13) and spinal syndrome (n = 9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Posterolateral access was used in 13 cases and the anterior route in 2, both requiring a graft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After a follow-up of 5 years 1 month, functional and subjective results were excellent or good in 83% of the cases, acceptable in 6% and poor in 11% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two failures with the posterolateral route corresponded to one patient with initial trauma-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0010550'>paraplegia</z:hpo> and another with neurological aggravation after the first laminectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In our experience, the posteriolateral route is preferred to allow good visual control even in cases involving several levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Secondary laminectomy may be performed without risking displacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The presence of the Adamkiewicz artery on the same side and at the same level dictates use of the anterior route which may soon be replaced by video-assisted thoracoscopy to avoid resection of the rib </plain></SENT>
