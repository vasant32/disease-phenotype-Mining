<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In both cases, there was bilateral, multisegmental infarction at the lower cervicothoracic arterial zone (inferior cervical sector), predominantly within the territory of the anterior spinal artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinically, both infants had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>respiratory failure</z:hpo>, diaphragmatic respiration, intercostal <z:hpo ids='HP_0003470'>paralysis</z:hpo>, bell-shaped deformity of the thorax, and bilateral arm <z:mp ids='MP_0000754'>paresis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intubation and ventilator support were required for weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eventual extubation was followed by recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>respiratory failure</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100750'>atelectasis</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At the level of the infarction, multiple, scattered scars were found in central, perimedullary, and intramedullary arteries, but not in their parent vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The etiology of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">angiopathy</z:e> was not determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These cases demonstrate that discrete arterial infarction of the cord can occur in premature babies, and that such a lesion should be considered in the differential diagnosis of neonatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>respiratory failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
