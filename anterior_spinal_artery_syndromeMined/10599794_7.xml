<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Neurovascular contact (NVC) with the root exit zone (REZ) of the ipsilateral facial nerve is associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0010828'>hemifacial spasm</z:hpo> (HFS), but unresolved issues remain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To 1) determine the frequency of symptomatic and nonsymptomatic NVC, 2) determine the features of NVC associated with HFS, and 3) correlate severity of HFS to these features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two independent, blinded, prospective assessments of high-resolution <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography (MRA) images were performed on Chinese cases (HFS: n = 44; age-matched control subjects: n = 20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Over 88% of 44 symptomatic sides in patients with HFS had NVC of the ipsilateral facial nerve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At least 80% of symptomatic sides involved NVC at the anterior aspect of the REZ [REZ(ant.)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although NVC was observed in approximately half of nonsymptomatic sides, at least 70% of them were not at REZ(ant.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>NVC at the cisternal and intracanalicular portions of the facial nerve were not associated with HFS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Half of our patients with HFS had bilateral NVC, but none had bilateral symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Most of our <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>/MRA images showed that the size and position of the arterial branches of the vertebrobasilar system were markedly asymmetric </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of patients with bilateral NVC, over 83% had asymmetric NVC sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The anterior inferior cerebellar artery was the most common vessel involved in NVC, but was not significantly associated with HFS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Most of the NVC involved one vessel at one contact point with no indentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The development of HFS was significantly associated with nerve indentation in NVC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The development and severity of HFS were not associated with multiple contact points in NVC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>No significant interobserver variability existed between the blinded assessments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: MRI/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography are accurate, fast, and safe in characterizing neurovascular contact (NVC) at the brainstem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The site of NVC and ipsilateral facial nerve indentation in NVC are significant determinants for the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010828'>hemifacial spasm</z:hpo> (HFS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The lack of bilateral NVC at the anterior aspect of the root exit zone of the facial nerve could explain in part the lack of bilateral symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The development and severity of HFS are not associated with a specific blood vessel or multiple contact points in NVC </plain></SENT>
