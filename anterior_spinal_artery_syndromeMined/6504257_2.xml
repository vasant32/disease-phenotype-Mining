<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On admission, neurological examination revealed right <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> with normotensive deep tendon reflexes, and loss of pain and temperature sensations below the level of C5 on his left side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Position sense of fingers and toes was diminished on his right side, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100963'>hyperesthesia</z:hpo> was recognized at the area of C4 level </plain></SENT>
