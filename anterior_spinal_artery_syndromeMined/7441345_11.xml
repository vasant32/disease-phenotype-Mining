<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Vertical subluxation results from 1) destruction of the transverse atlantal, apical, and alar ligaments of the atlas and odontoid, and 2) bone resorption in the occipital condyles, lateral masses of the atlas, and basilar processes of the skull </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neruological symptoms represented direct compression of the medulla by the dens, a mechanism confirmed at operation and autopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Recognition of progressive neurological deficit is often difficult in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> because of their inactivity and their atrophic and immobile joints, but is essential if appropriate decompressive or stabilizing procedures are to be done </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In patients with vertical subluxation of the dens, the transoral approach with removal of the odontoid is recommended </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Decompression should be extensive, including the fibrous capsule around the odontoid and overlying synovial tissue as well as the odontoid itself </plain></SENT>
