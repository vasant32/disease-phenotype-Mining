<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To report a patient presenting with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242644" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Brown-Sequard syndrome</z:e> due to cervical intradural disc <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019270" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herniation</z:e> after spinal manipulation therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Spinal manipulation therapy (SMT) is often used by people with neck pain or discomfort as an alternative therapy due to its claimed less invasiveness and comparable efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, excessive manipulations are reported to cause rare but serious complications such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002445'>tetraplegia</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338586" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vertebral artery dissection</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100310'>epidural hematoma</z:hpo>, and phrenic nerve injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Clinical history, physical examination, and radiographic findings of the patient were described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Anterior cervical discectomy at the C3/C4 level and interbody fusion with a Caspar plate-screw system for fixation, were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A favorable surgical outcome was obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242644" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Brown-Sequard syndrome</z:e> improved and the patient regained full muscle power at a 3-months follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Cervical intradural disc <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019270" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herniation</z:e> after SMT is rare and most often cause <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242644" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Brown-Sequard syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Definite diagnosis and prompt surgery usually achieves a satisfactory outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Anterior discectomy with interbody fusion is recommended </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The OPLL associated with degenerative disc reminds us of the increased risk of intradural disc <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019270" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herniation</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Those high-risk groups should be more cautious with spinal manipulation therapy due to its serious sequelae </plain></SENT>
