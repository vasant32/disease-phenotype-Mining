<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Approximately 50% of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0012063'>aneurysmal bone cyst</z:hpo> of the spine are in the pediatric age group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0012063'>Aneurysmal bone cyst</z:hpo> is considered a locally aggressive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0086692" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">benign tumor</z:e> that may involve the posterior and anterior elements of the spine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Intralesional extended curettage and bone-grafting is the mainstay of treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0012063'>aneurysmal bone cysts</z:hpo> involving the long bones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the proximity to neurovascular structures and the potential remaining growth of the spine make its management in the spine more challenging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the clinical presentation and the results of surgical treatment, following complete intralesional curettage along with spinal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003881,C0003090" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality;Therapeutic or Preventive Procedure" abbrv="">arthrodesis</z:e> in pediatric patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0012063'>aneurysmal bone cysts</z:hpo> of the cervical spine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the cases of seven children who were surgically treated for a primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0012063'>aneurysmal bone cyst</z:hpo> of the cervical spine between 1988 and 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were four boys and three girls who had a mean age of 11.9 years (range, eight to 16.2 years) at the time of diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean duration of follow-up was 46.5 months (range, twenty-six to ninety-eight months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean age at the time of follow-up was sixteen years (range, 10.6 to 24.6 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Neck pain was the most common presenting symptom, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0700594" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">radiculopathy</z:e> was the most common finding on physical examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Radiographs, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging were highly suggestive for the diagnosis that was confirmed histologically in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The majority (four) of the patients required combined anterior and posterior approaches for complete removal of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003881,C0003090" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality;Therapeutic or Preventive Procedure" abbrv="">arthrodesis</z:e> of the spine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Two patients required additional procedures: one for a local recurrence and one for nonunion of the atlantooccipital junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were free of evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent disease</z:e> at the time of the last follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>With the exception of one patient who had permanent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002277'>Horner syndrome</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332335" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arterial embolization</z:e>, complete <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> excision by intralesional curettage and burring, followed by local <z:hpo ids='HP_0002948'>spinal fusion</z:hpo>, yield satisfactory results with a low rate of complications and low recurrence in children with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0012063'>aneurysmal bone cyst</z:hpo> of the cervical spine </plain></SENT>
