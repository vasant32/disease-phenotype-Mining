<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: to evaluate the prevalence and the possible causes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0752130" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">spinal cord ischaemia</z:e> (SCI) following endovascular abdominal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> repair (EVAR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Differences in the incidence of this complication between endovascular treatment and published series following conventional treatment were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: analysis of patients enrolled in the EUROSTAR collaborators registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: 2862 patients operated between July 1994 and July 2000 were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patient characteristics, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, procedure characteristics and potential causative factors with particular interference with pelvic circulation or pelvic embolisation were related to the risk of SCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: six patients (0.21%) were identified with postoperative symptoms of SCI: one complete <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0748902" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">spinal cord infarction</z:e> (type I), two <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221069" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">anterior spinal artery syndromes</z:e> (type II) and three combinations of root lesions and centromedullary <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (type III) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the patients with type I or II lesions (3/6) no regression of neurological symptoms was noted, whereas the patients with type III lesions (3/6) had partial regression of symptoms in two cases and a full neurological recovery in one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a significant correlation between emboli (p &lt; 0.001) and coil embolisation of hypogastric or lumbar arteries (p &lt; 0.029) and the development of SCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: SCI is equally rare following open aortic surgery or EVAR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Microembolism is the probable cause </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>SCI should be mentioned when taking informed consent </plain></SENT>
