<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We recently experienced a patient with episodic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002321'>vertigo</z:hpo> and hyposthenia of the left side of the body on rotational movement of the neck </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On surgical exploration of the atlanto-axial area of the vertebral artery where dynamic constriction of the artery could be observed by angiography, we found that the right vertebral artery was entrapped and constricted by the anterior branch of the second cervical nerve with fibrous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> after injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With the release and resection of the injured nerve, the patient became free of any <z:hpo ids='HP_0002321'>vertigo</z:hpo> or hyposthenia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although this kind of etiology involving entrapment-constriction of the vertebral artery by the cervical nerve after trauma has not been reported at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> in the literature, we should always keep this in mind when dealing with patients with cervical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002321'>vertigo</z:hpo> after trauma </plain></SENT>
