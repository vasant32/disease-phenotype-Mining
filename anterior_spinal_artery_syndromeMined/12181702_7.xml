<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The authors report the clinical application of a new microsurgical technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cervical anterior foraminotomy (uncoforaminotomy), which is used for the surgical treatment of unilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0742186" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cervical radiculopathy</z:e> secondary to posterolateral disc <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019270" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herniations</z:e> or spondylotic foraminal stenoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Between June 2000 and May 2001, 34 patients (16 men and 18 women with a mean age of 43.8 years, range 29 to 80 years) underwent anterior cervical foraminotomy (uncoforaminotomy) for the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0742186" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cervical radiculopathy</z:e> at one or two adjacent levels in the Neurosurgical Department of the University of Vienna </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This surgical technique was devised to accomplish direct anterior decompression of the affected nerve root by removing an offending posterolateral sponylotic spur or disc fragment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The nerve root is decompressed from its origin in the spinal cord to the point were it passes behind the vertebral artery laterally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The intervertebral disc of the affected level is maintained in its form and function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, the functioning motion segment is preserved and fusion related sequelae, including graft related complications, graft site complications and the adjacent level disease, are avoided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Prior to its clinical application, anatomical features of the anterior cervical spine were reviewed, and an anatomical morphometric analysis and work-up of the technique was performed in 4 cervical specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: The follow-up period varied from two to 17 months with a mean of 8.2 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The large majority (97%) of patients were pleased with the results of their operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The relief of neck pain and redicular pain in the affected dermatome was immediate in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Motor-<z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0748618" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sensory deficit</z:e> improved dramatically immediately postoperatively, and improved to normalisation in the majority of patients within 3 to 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Two of the patients sustained an incomplete transient <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0542142" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy</z:e>, which fully resolved within two to 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>One of the patients had a repeat <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019270" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herniation</z:e> on the second postoperative day, but recovered completely after re-operation and continued to do well at the 6-month follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>No permanent surgery related morbidity or associated complications were encountered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: The results indicate that this new microsurgical technique is an attractive treatment option for adequate anterior decompression of the cervical nerve root via a minimized approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>It was associated with excellent clinical outcome and a less painful postoperative course, allowing patients an almost immediate return to unrestricted full activity </plain></SENT>
