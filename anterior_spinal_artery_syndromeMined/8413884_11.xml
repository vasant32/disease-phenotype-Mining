<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report our experience with two patients whose large <z:hpo ids='HP_0010797'>hemangioblastomas</z:hpo> were embolized preoperatively and were totally resected with minimal blood loss and satisfactory postoperative outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Embolizations were carried out within 3 days of surgery, with the patient under general anesthesia, with 150- to 250-microns Contour emboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A 65-year-old woman with progressive, severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002196'>myelopathy</z:hpo> from a 4.5 x 2.1 x 1.4 cm intramedullary <z:hpo ids='HP_0010797'>hemangioblastoma</z:hpo> at T4 underwent embolization of the left T2 and T3 intercostal arteries; a 29-year-old man with Lindau's syndrome and posterior fossa <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> from a 3.8 x 1.8 x 1.8 cm right <z:hpo ids='HP_0006880'>cerebellar hemangioblastoma</z:hpo> underwent embolization of the right posterior inferior cerebellar artery, two right anterior inferior cerebellar arteries, and a dural branch of the right vertebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Embolization led to the complete obliteration of the tumoral blush without neurological sequelae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both lesions were completely resected with a blood loss of 50 to 100 ml, with <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> occurring mainly from the pseudocapsule of the lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Preoperative embolization of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010797'>hemangioblastomas</z:hpo> is a useful and relatively safe procedure that reduces blood loss at the time of surgery and allows complete resection </plain></SENT>
