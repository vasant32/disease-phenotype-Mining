<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Spinal anaesthesia is selected for many lower extremity surgical procedures each year in the United States with a high degree of safety and efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Even when adverse neurological outcomes have occurred, anatomical abnormality or <z:hpo ids='HP_0003256'>coagulopathy</z:hpo> have been implicated in the majority of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="28918">Epinephrine</z:chebi> is used in high concentrations in many of these <z:chebi fb="37" ids="38867">anaesthetics</z:chebi> to increase the duration and intensity of the block </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28918">epinephrine</z:chebi> is known to decrease spinal cord blood flow, its use in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> patients has not caused complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We report a case where spinal anaesthesia with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3215">bupivacaine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28918">epinephrine</z:chebi> resulted in anterior spinal artery compromise and the development of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0392548" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cauda equina syndrome</z:e> postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL FEATURES: A 57-yr-old man with severe coronary artery and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>peripheral vascular disease</z:hpo> was scheduled for incision and drain of an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> of the left thigh </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>He received an atraumatic dural puncture and injection of 12.5 mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3215">bupivacaine</z:chebi> with 0.2 ml 1:1000 epinephrine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, he experienced a severe, painful sensation of the thighs which resolved with development of the block </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Postoperatively, he was noted to have exacerbation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003701'>proximal muscle weakness</z:hpo> and decreased perineal sensation and rectal tone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Subsequent EMG studies demonstrated proximal neuron loss consistent with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0392548" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cauda equina syndrome</z:e>, presumed to be related to insufficiency of the anterior spinal artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Routine use of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28918">epinephrine</z:chebi> in spinal anaesthesia for patients with multi-organ <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> should be considered carefully because of the possibility of vascular insufficiency of the spinal cord which would be exaggerated by the vasoconstrictive effect of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28918">epinephrine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
