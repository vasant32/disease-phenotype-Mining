<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Forty-six cases are presented, and surgical techniques are described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0010828'>hemifacial spasm</z:hpo> the intracranial neurovascular lysis of Jannetta is a valid operation with the best results to date but has a 7 1/2% risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0009900'>unilateral deafness</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The extracranial submastoid partial section of Scoville is completely safe and gives excellent results, but there is a probability of mild to moderate return of the spasm in one to two year's time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In spastic torticollis the accepted radical operation consists of bilateral anterior rhizotomy of the upper three roots plus bilateral spinal accessory nerve section in the neck </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A tragic complication of this operation has recently been observed by ourselves, Sweet, and Hamlin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This complication is bilateral infarction of the medulla (bilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043019" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wallenberg's syndrome</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This has also been reported as occurring following chiropractic manipulations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For this reason the writer does limited unilateral sectioning of the spinal accessory nerve in the neck and resection of the upper third of the sternomastoid muscle, as a first stage procedure, in those cases in which rotation of the neck is the principal symptom, before doing the radical operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Safeguards to prevent this complication include preoperative vertebral arteriography and preservation of both motor and sensory radicular arteries under magnification and maintenance of adequate neck support during the early postoperative days </plain></SENT>
