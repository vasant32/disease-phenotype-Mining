<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Stellate ganglion block (SGB) is commonly performed for upper extremity <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0458219" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">complex regional pain syndrome</z:e> and other conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Known complications of stellate block include <z:hpo ids='HP_0002277'>Horner's syndrome</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001609'>hoarseness</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> formation, airway compromise, immediate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> (presumably from vertebral artery injection), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A previous arterial <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> study demonstrated other vessels, eg, the ascending and deep cervical arteries, reinforcing the blood supply of the spinal cord and brain stem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The potential role of these vessels in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> or <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> during SGB has not been studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The anatomical recording log from 10 cadaver dissections and photographic records of same were reviewed to ascertain the presence of the ascending or deep cervical arteries, or other branches emanating from the thyrocervical or costocervical trunk and their relationship to the medial anterior surface of the C6 and C7 transverse processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 4 cases, as determined by the dissection log, and in 6 cases, determined by photographic images, the ascending cervical artery or a branch from the thyrocervical trunk passed over the anterior aspect of the transverse processes of C6 or C7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Arterial vessels other than the vertebral artery that also supply the anterior spinal cord and brain stem pass directly anterior to the transverse processes at the most common sites of the SGB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is anatomically possible, therefore, that accidental injection or induced spasm of these vessels and not the vertebral arteries is responsible for some cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp>, or other vascular complications during SGB </plain></SENT>
