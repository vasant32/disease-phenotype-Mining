<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The symptoms resolved at first, but then recurred 3 years later and progressed slowly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neurological workup failed to define the cause until a thoracic aortogram showed an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> in the middle portion of the descending aorta in close proximity to a vessel supplying the anterior spinal artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After the operative repair with precautions taken to avoid further neurological injury, the neurologic deficit resolved partially </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Because of the potential for symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0752130" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">spinal cord ischemia</z:e> resulting from lesions of the aorta, angiographic delineation of the spinal cord blood supply is valuable in planning operative repair </plain></SENT>
