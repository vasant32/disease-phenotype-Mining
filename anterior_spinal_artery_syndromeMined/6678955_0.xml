<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Our previous study provided a new two-dimensional echocardiographic technique for detecting peripheral "right" coronary artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026691" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MLNS|MCLS">Kawasaki disease</z:e> using a subcostal approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present paper, we presented an additional study for detecting peripheral "left" coronary artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because the left anterior descending artery runs along the anterior interventricular sulcus and the left circumflex artery around the mitral valve ring, both coronary regions are difficult to search by a conventional method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Then coronary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of these regions were searched using the subcostal approach in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>First, the sector beam was directed toward the heart on a plane parallel to a line between the patient's shoulders which allowed simultaneous visualization of four chambers (P1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The area around the mitral valve ring in this plane was examined for coronary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of the peripheral left circumflex artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Secondary, the beam section was positioned parallel to the line cutting both the long axes of the sternum and spinal column which allowed visualization of the right ventricular outflow tract, pulmonary valves, interventricular septum, mitral valves and left atrium (P2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirdly, the sector plane was angled to the left (P3), and still more to the left (P4) until the left atrium just disappeared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>By scanning from P2 to P4, the area around the mitral valve ring was examined for coronary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of the peripheral left circumflex artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>By scanning from P4 to the cardiac apex (P5), the anterior interventricular sulcus was searched for coronary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of the peripheral left anterior descending artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of 143 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026691" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MLNS|MCLS">Kawasaki disease</z:e>, aged two months to 8 years, 7 peripheral left coronary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were visualized in five patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These were three <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> in the left circumflex artery at the origin of the obtuse marginal artery, two <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> in segment 13, and two <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> in the left anterior descending artery at the origin of the second diagonal branch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These echocardiographic features coincided well in size, shape and anatomic location with angiographic appearances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In one patient whose echocardiogram in sector P2 showed a small echo-free space (2 X 2 mm) at the area around the mitral valve ring, the angiographic study showed the intact left circumflex artery, suggesting that there was a limitation to distinguish a very small coronary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> from a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>There was no false negative diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>These results showed that this new echocardiographic technique is useful for detecting peripheral left coronary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026691" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MLNS|MCLS">Kawasaki disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
