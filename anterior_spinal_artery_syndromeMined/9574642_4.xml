<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Intramedullary spinal cord <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformations</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp>) are comprised of those <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp> which in either glomus or nidal form are found partially or entirely within the substance of the spinal cord </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An effort to subdivide these lesions into either glomus Type II or juvenile Type III spinal cord <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp> has underscored the diffuse, unresectable nature of the latter but has done little to suggest a logical management paradigm for the more well-defined, low-flow glomus lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To address this shortcoming, 15 cases of glomus Type II spinal <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp> were identified from a larger series of a variety of spinal <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and superselective angiography rendered the anatomic diagnosis of these lesions accurate in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> lesions were approached posteriorly via a standard laminectomy, with the goal of total extirpation, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients underwent immediate postoperative angiography to verify cure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the vast majority of cases, patients underwent follow-up imaging to confirm the durability of this cure, and long-term outcome was determined using both a subjective quality of life assay and a functional grading scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Age, sex, mode of presentation, and radiographic features were subsequently analyzed with respect to functional outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Most glomus spinal <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp> presented with a rapid cascade of signs and symptoms (73%), often caused by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (60%) and often leading to significant neurological deficits (47%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Initially, 14 of 15 patients (94%) were angiographically cured of their malformations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The remaining patient was neurologically improved after a 90% resection, and follow-up angiography demonstrated that the residual was thrombosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, not uncommonly, follow-up angiography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed recurrences, with three of the patients who underwent delayed imaging (23%) demonstrating new draining veins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Fortunately, in each case, the recurrence was asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the long-term cure rate (mean follow-up, 8.5 yr; range, 1-17 yr) was 80%, with no subsequent <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> or progression of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Outcomes were generally good, with six patients (40%) demonstrating objective improvement, eight (53%) being neurologically stable, and one (7%) being worse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Sixty-six percent were independent, 20% required moderate assistance, and 14% remained entirely dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>There were no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Patients possessing lesions with large direct feeders off the anterior spinal artery and occupying a primarily anterior position in the cord fared somewhat worse, as did those with rapidly progressing symptomatology in the absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>However, even in those with preserved or improved function, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> pain was a significant problem, affecting one-third of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> pain was especially common in young women who had presented with significant preoperative pain that responded poorly to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subsequent therapeutic manipulations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: With careful evaluation of high-quality superselective angiography and the judicious use of preoperative embolization, posterior surgical approaches can deliver results comparable with those achieved for other benign intramedullary lesions in terms of long-term cure (80%), control of symptom progression (100%), and good functional outcome (86%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Despite these results, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> dysesthetic pain syndromes are not uncommon and continue to present a significant management problem </plain></SENT>
