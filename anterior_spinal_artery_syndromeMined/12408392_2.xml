<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patient presented with a mild central cord syndrome, as well as anterior subluxation of the C-2 vertebral body upon C-3, bilateral neural arch fractures, and a unilateral locked facet joint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Digital subtraction angiography revealed occlusion of the right VA, with the posterior cerebral circulation entirely dependent on the left VA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intraoperative angiography demonstrated that complete reduction of the dislocation would have caused severe stenosis of the left VA; partial reduction and anterior fixation were performed instead, with excellent neurological outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this case, intraoperative angiography was particularly useful for preventing brain-related ischemic complications during reduction </plain></SENT>
