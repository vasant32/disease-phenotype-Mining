<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: The cervical spine in a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038013" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ankylosing spondylitis</z:e> (AS) (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038013" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Bechterew disease</z:e>) is exposed to maximal risk due to physical load </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Even minor trauma can cause fractures because of the spine's poor elasticity (so-called bamboo spine) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors conducted a study to determine the characteristics of cervical fractures in patients with AS to describe the standard procedures in the treatment of this condition at two trauma centers and to discuss complications of and outcomes after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between 1990 and 2006, 37 patients were surgically treated at two institutions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were examined preoperatively and when being discharged from the hospital for rehabilitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Single-session (11 cases) and two-session anterior-posterior (13 cases), anterior (11 cases), posterior (two cases), and laminectomy (one case) procedures were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The injury pattern, segments involved, the pre- and postoperative neurological status, and complications were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Preoperative neurological deficits were present in 36 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients experienced improvement postoperatively, and there was no case of surgery-related neurological deterioration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In patients in whom treatment was delayed because of late diagnosis, preoperative neurological deficits were more severe and improvement worse than those treated earlier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The causes of three <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002098'>respiratory distress</z:hpo> syndrome due to a rigid thorax and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> due to rupture of the vertebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were 12 perioperative complications (32%), three <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e>, one <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep venous thrombosis</z:hpo>, five early implant failures, and the three aforementioned fatalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There were no cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100310'>epidural hematoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> five cases in which early implant failure required revision surgery, the initial stabilization procedure had been anterior only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>A comparison of complications and the outcomes at the two centers revealed no significant differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The standard intervention for these injuries is open reduction, anterior decompression and fusion, and anterior-posterior stabilization; these procedures may be conducted in one or two stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Based on the early implant failures that occurred exclusively after single-session anterior stabilizations (five of 10--a failure rate of 50%), the authors have performed only posterior and anterior procedures since 1997 at both centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic investigations include computed tomography scanning or magnetic resonance imaging of the whole spine, because additional injuries are common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The causative trauma may be very slight, and diagnosis may be delayed because plain radiographs can be initially misinterpreted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>In cases in which diagnosis is delayed, patients present with more severe neurological deficits, and postoperative improvement is less pronounced than that in patients in whom a prompt diagnosis is established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Because of postoperative pulmonary and ischemic complications, the mortality rate is high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>In the present series the mortality rate was lower than the mean rate reported in the literature </plain></SENT>
