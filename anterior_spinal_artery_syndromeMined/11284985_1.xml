<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The sulco commissuralis syndrome represents a partial or incomplete ASAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report two cases of ischemic spinal cord syndromes after transthoracic esophagectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This represents a prevalence of this syndrome of 0.2% in more than 1000 consecutive esophagectomies performed at our institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patient 1 developed an ASAS on the first day after esophagectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patient 2 showed the pathognomonic clinical signs associated with sulco commissuralis syndrome after an asymptomatic window </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In both patients, the extent of the neurologic symptoms initially improved but then remained unchanged for the rest of the follow-up of 9 and 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although the prognosis of neurologic syndromes resulting from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0748902" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">spinal cord infarction</z:e> is poor, preoperative tests to identify patients at risk appear not to be justified because of the very low incidence of these syndromes after esophagectomy and the poor sensitivity and specificity of currently available diagnostic modalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the possibility of ischemic spinal cord syndrome should be kept in mind when patients present with neurologic symptoms after esophagectomy </plain></SENT>
