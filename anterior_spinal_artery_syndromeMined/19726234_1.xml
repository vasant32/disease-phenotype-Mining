<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND CONTEXT: The risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> because of carotid retraction during an anterior cervical spine surgery as well as the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> complications after an anterior cervical corpectomy under deep anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy is a surgical issue poorly addressed in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To describe the feasibility and safety of a simultaneous carotid endarterectomy and anterior corpectomy and fusion under deep anticoagulation in a patient with a cervical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002176'>spinal cord compression</z:hpo> and a severe carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Case report </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors describe the case of a 79-year-old man who had a 1-month history of progressive pain in the neck and left arm, associated with progressive <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> in the left arm and leg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>He also presented a history of coronaropathy and bilateral severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> for which he was receiving a regimen of antiplatelet therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The cervical magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a C4-C5 disc <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019270" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herniation</z:e> migrating down to C5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>His condition worsened rapidly during hospitalization prompting a rapid decompression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Given the necessity of a C5 corpectomy and the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> during anterior cervical spine surgery, it was therefore decided to undertake the surgical procedure under efficient <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> and antiplatelet therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A combined endarterectomy and spinal decompression and fusion were then performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient recovered neurologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This case suggests that such a combined carotid endarterectomy and cervical corpectomy with fusion under <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> and antiplatelet therapy is feasible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, even if the unique clinical presentation of our patient led us to undertake such a surgical strategy, therapeutic decision in patients presenting with both severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> and cervical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002176'>spinal cord compression</z:hpo> should rely on a case-by-case analysis </plain></SENT>
