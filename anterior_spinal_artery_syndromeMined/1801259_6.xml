<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This is the first report of a large series of patients undergoing preoperative traction to reduce spinomedullary compression from cranial settling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, an attempt was made to reduce the malalignment with Gardner-Wells or halo traction before posterior fusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One patient required an anterior retropharyngeal decompression of the odontoid performed as a one-stage procedure at the time of the posterior operation, and two required subsequent anterior transoral-transpharyngeal resection of the odontoid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From 1974 to 1989, 37 patients underwent posterior occipital cervical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003881,C0003090" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality;Therapeutic or Preventive Procedure" abbrv="">arthrodesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases presented with neurologic deficit, and most had signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002512'>brain stem compression</z:hpo>, such as L'hermitte's sign or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0475712,C0020681" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Ondine's curse</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most common cause of basilar impression was <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo>, neoplastic destruction, previously failed C1-C2 fusion, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Down's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean postoperative follow-up was 2 years and 10 months; the patients with less than 2 years' follow-up were followed until successful fusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eight of 9 patients with L'hermitte's sign or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0475712,C0020681" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Ondine's curse</z:e> and 10 of 12 patients with intractable occipital pain were relieved of their symptoms after reduction and triple-wire stabilization-fusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eighteen of 25 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002423'>long tract signs</z:hpo> improved after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, 14 (93.3%) of 15 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002196'>myelopathy</z:hpo> improved when successful preoperative reduction of their deformity occurred, whereas only 4 (40%) of 10 patients with fixed basilar impression improved (chi 2 = 8.57, P = .014) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Symptoms such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0475712,C0020681" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Ondine's curse</z:e>, L'hermitte's sign, intractable occipital <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002196'>myelopathy</z:hpo> are usually relieved by skeletal traction and posterior fusion without need of an additional transmucosal anterior procedure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
