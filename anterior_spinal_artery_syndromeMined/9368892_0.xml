<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>She had neither repeated episode of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> nor a past history of neurosurgical operation or head injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neurological examination revealed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000458'>anosmia</z:hpo>, moderate degree of <z:mp ids='MP_0004740'>sensorineural hearing loss</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>She showed loss of caloric response bilaterally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No <z:hpo ids='HP_0000639'>nystagmus</z:hpo> was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="HFA">Romberg</z:e> sign was present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>cerebellar ataxia</z:hpo> was noted in the finger-to-nose or the heel-to-knee test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No adiadochokinesis was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Deep tendon reflexes were increased in both upper and lower extremities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Sensation was intact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>She showed disturbance of the righting reflex in the tilt-table examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CSF were under <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pressure, xanthochromic with siderophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CSF total protein and ferritin level were elevated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>T2-weighted image (TE4000/TR100) of high field strength magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed marginal hypointensity of the brain stem, the Sylvian fissures, the tips of temporal lobes, anterior cerebellar surfaces and the entire spinal cord </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Angiography of the cerebral vessels and spinal arteries failed to identify the source of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>It seemed likely that she had lost bilateral vestibular and auditory functions caused by hemosidelin deposition to her eighth nerves which are often affected by this disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Her disturbance of gait and station was apparently similar to cerebellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0002066'>ataxic gait</z:hpo>, however, she did not have <z:hpo ids='HP_0002070'>limb ataxia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The electronystagmogram revealed marked degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001751'>vestibular dysfunction</z:hpo> (VOR) and relative sparing of cerebellar function (OKN) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Her disturbance of the righting reflex in the tilt-table examination and the characteristic feature of her <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="HFA">Romberg</z:e> sign with directional preponderance also indicate that the bilateral loss of vestibular functions, i.e., vestibular <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> caused her <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0394006" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dysequilibrium syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>It is our impression that vestibular <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> might precede <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>cerebellar ataxia</z:hpo> commonly reported so far </plain></SENT>
