<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Reference textbooks on the intracranial complications of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rhinosinusitis</z:e> imply that many of the intracranial complications of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rhinosinusitis</z:e> can be prevented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to examine whether or not this is true </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective case series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study included 47 consecutive patients presenting with intracranial complications secondary to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rhinosinusitis</z:e> between 1992 to 1999 with a mean follow-up of 5 years and 1 month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The most common presenting symptoms of intracranial involvement were an altered mental state, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo>, a unilateral <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo>, or a cranial nerve sign </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These justify an urgent magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The importance of imaging before a lumbar puncture cannot be overemphasized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of particular note was the finding that 21 patients (45%) presented with a periorbital <z:hpo ids='HP_0100658'>cellulitis</z:hpo> or frontal swelling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it does not follow that because a collection of pus presents anteriorly it precludes any intracranial involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>More than half of our patients (55%) had visited their primary care physician with an upper <z:hpo ids='HP_0011947'>respiratory tract infection</z:hpo> and had been treated appropriately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Once any central symptoms or signs developed, there was little evidence of any significant delay in referral to our unit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Only six patients had a history of nasal disease, three having had recent sinus surgery and three having had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000462'>nasal polyps</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Nine patients had significant long-term morbidity, seven patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e>, one patient had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002357'>dysphasia</z:hpo>, and one patient had right arm <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The single <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in our series was associated with a cavernous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The report emphasizes the need for surgeons to be alert to the diagnosis, particularly in patients with a periorbital <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> or frontal swelling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Sinus surgery has a role in obtaining pus for culture, as well as draining the sinus if it is in continuity with an intracranial collection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Intracranial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> secondary to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rhinosinusitis</z:e> occur sporadically and, although it appears that this cannot be prevented, early recognition and treatment are essential to reduce any subsequent morbidity or mortality </plain></SENT>
