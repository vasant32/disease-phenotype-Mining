<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Nowadays the complications arising from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000246'>sinusitis</z:hpo> are rare since the introduction of antibiotics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However <z:hpo ids='HP_0000246'>sinusitis</z:hpo> and its complications are still life-threatening and if neglected may result in high morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is the purpose of this study to draw attention to the effects of the spread of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> beyond the sinus wall and thus to influence the clinician in his management in order to prevent the subsequent spread of the disease, and secondly make him aware of the sinogenic origin of these complications when he sees them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A retrospective study of 90 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000246'>sinusitis</z:hpo> seen over a ten year period between 1988 and 1997 in the ENT Department, University College Hospital, Madan was (lone and those that had complications were further analysed to meet the objectives of this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were 90 patients seen with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000246'>sinusitis</z:hpo> over the ten years period, out of which 33 (37%) cases had complications, 17 males and 16 females (M.F.1:1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The average age of cases with complications was 28 years (age range 2.5 - 75 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>66.6% of the complications cases occurred in age group under 30 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus children and young adults were mostly affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six cases (79%) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011109'>chronic sinusitis</z:hpo> developed complications while in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000255'>acute sinusitis</z:hpo> there were 7 cases (21%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The site affected most commonly by complications was the orbit (41%) followed by Sinus wall (32%), orophyarynx (18%), intracranial (5%); no car complications were seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The type of complications seen at various sites and their incidence were also highlighted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus with this study it is hoped that clinicians would be reminded that complications of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000246'>sinusitis</z:hpo> still occur and hence be aware of the necessity to recognize and prevent them as rapidly as possible to avoid serious consequences </plain></SENT>
