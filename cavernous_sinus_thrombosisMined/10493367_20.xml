<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of stereotactic radiosurgery, either with or without transarterial embolization, in the treatment of patients with dural arteriovenous fistulae (DAVFs) of the cavernous sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed the findings, from a prospectively established database, for 20 patients with cavernous sinus DAVFs who were treated with either radiosurgery alone (n = 7) or radiosurgery and transarterial embolization (n = 13) in a 7-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up period after radiosurgery was 36 months (range, 4-59 mo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nineteen of 20 patients (95%) experienced improvement of their clinical symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fourteen of 15 patients (93%) experienced either total (n = 13) or nearly total (n = 1) obliteration of their DAVFs, as documented by angiography performed a median of 12 months after radiosurgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No patient experienced a recurrence of symptoms after angiography showed DAVF obliteration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two patients developed new neurological deficits after embolization procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One patient exhibited temporary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> secondary to a venous infarction; another patient exhibited permanent VIth cranial nerve <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cavernous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two patients experienced recurrent symptoms and underwent repeat transarterial embolization at 7 and 12 months; both patients achieved clinical and angiographic cures (5 and 10 mo later, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One patient experienced recurrent visual symptoms and underwent transvenous embolization 4 months after radiosurgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Staged radiosurgery and transarterial embolization provided both rapid symptom relief and long-term cures for patients with cavernous sinus DAVFs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Radiosurgery alone was effective for patients with DAVFs whose arterial supply was not accessible via a transarterial approach, although the time course of symptom improvement was longer, compared with patients who also underwent embolization </plain></SENT>
