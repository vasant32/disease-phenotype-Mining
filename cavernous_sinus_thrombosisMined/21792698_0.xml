<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Lymphomatoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002955'>granulomatosis</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LYG</z:e>) is an angiocentric Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) related B-cell proliferation associated with a reactive T-cell component with an uncertain malignant potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LYG</z:e> present at diagnosis as a mass lesion in the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>) is rare, and only a few cases have been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this article we present four cases of tumoral <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LYG</z:e> and propose some guidelines for its management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Clinical, pathological, imaging and laboratory information of four immunocompetent patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of them treated surgically, with a final diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LYG</z:e> and presenting with an isolated intracranial tumoral mass is reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two parenchymal lesions were located in the cerebellum and temporal lobe, and the other two involved the cavernous sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At surgery they were avascular, hard, lard-like, necrotic and plastic well-defined lesions, with invasion of the leptomeninges and <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the small leptomeningeal arteries and veins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intraoperative pathology excluded any <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pathological studies showed a polymorphic and polyclonal infiltration around, in the wall and into the lumen of medium-sized cortical and leptomeningeal vessels causing their obstruction and tissular <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>EBV-infected cells were present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Making a preoperative diagnosis of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LYG</z:e> appearing initially as a tumoral mass is difficult because of the lack of pathognomonic clinical symptoms or imaging signs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Surgical management with radical resection of the mass is almost always followed by the long-term local control of the lesion, although the disease may have a disseminated, systemic or malignant evolution </plain></SENT>
