<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These complications are more common in older children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluate the disease and its management in children aged 2 and under </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifty-two records of children aged 2 and younger with OC secondary to ARS between 1993 and 2002 were reviewed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Parameters recorded included age, gender, clinical symptoms and signs, CT findings, duration of hospitalization, treatment before and during admission, cultures and outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-eight children were diagnosed with periorbital <z:hpo ids='HP_0100658'>cellulitis</z:hpo>, 4 with subperiosteal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> and none with orbital <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> or cavernous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> were managed conservatively except 1 who underwent surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CT scan performed in 8 children revealed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000246'>sinusitis</z:hpo> in only 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Average length of hospitalization was 3.6 days for preseptal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100658'>cellulitis</z:hpo> and 6.5 for postseptal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100658'>cellulitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: SOC secondary to ARS mandates meticulous multidisciplinary follow-up in hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CT scan and surgery are indicated in cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000602'>ophthalmoplegia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000520'>proptosis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000505'>decreased visual acuity</z:hpo> or failure of conservative treatment within 48 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, most children aged 2 and younger respond well to conservative treatment and no surgical intervention is required </plain></SENT>
