<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: The purpose of this study was to describe two challenging cases of septic cavernous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (CST), which presented with vastly different clinical signs and symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We present two cases of CST with markedly differing clinical presentations, medical comorbidities, and degree of impairment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Initial imaging of each patient failed to show <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both patients required multiple imaging procedures to arrive at the correct diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each child did respond to treatment once the correct diagnosis was made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CST can have a highly variable clinical presentation, from a subtle <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271355" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sixth nerve palsy</z:e> to complete <z:hpo ids='HP_0000602'>ophthalmoplegia</z:hpo> and loss of periorbital sensation and corneal reflex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>Onset</z:hpo> of symptoms may be <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and fulminant or indolent and delayed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis is challenging, requiring clinical suspicion and confirmation by imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These cases illustrate the importance of retaining clinical suspicion when <z:hpo ids='HP_0006824'>cranial nerve palsies</z:hpo> persist and how valuable rescanning a patient can be </plain></SENT>
