<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENT AND METHODS: We report a case of otogenic cavernous sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0004418'>thrombophlebitis</z:hpo> (CST) in a 6-year-old boy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CST diagnosis was based on clinical signs (septic illness, ocular nerve palsy and chemosis), and neuro-imaging confirmed the diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Contrast-enhanced CT scan demonstrates different signs: (i) filling defect or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> enhancement of cavernous sinus, (ii) cavernous sinus enlargement with bulging of the lateral wall, (iii) intensive enhancement of lateral wall corresponding to enhancement of a collateral network replacing the thrombosed cavernous veins, (iiii) and sometimes indirect orbital signs (exophthalmus, densification of the retro-orbital fat, superior ophthalmic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> with partial or no enhancement in case of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> extension) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The bacteria most frequently found are Streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, <z:mp ids='MP_0001795'>Gram-negative</z:mp> rods and anaerobes combined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The therapeutic management of CST consists of intravenous administration of appropriate antibiotics combined radical mastoidectomy if medical therapy has failed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">Anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy is controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Knowledge of early diagnosis of otogenic cavernous sinus is important because prior to the antibiotic era, CST was almost always fatal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Currently, therapeutic outcome is not always favorable due to high morbidity after aggressive treatment </plain></SENT>
