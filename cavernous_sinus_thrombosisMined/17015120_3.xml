<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Access to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> of the middle cranial base has traditionally required wide surgical exposures via open craniotomies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These open techniques often require the use of potentially disfiguring skin incisions and are often associated with a significant degree of brain retraction and potential morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report our experience with the use of a minimally invasive supraorbital endoscopic approach through the eyebrow for excision of middle cranial base <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> in 2 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We describe 2 patients with large-sized middle cranial fossa <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> (a medial sphenoid wing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002858'>meningioma</z:hpo> measuring 6 x 4 cm and a recurrent right cavernous sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0002858'>meningioma</z:hpo> measuring 4 x 3.5 cm) that were entirely removed via a fully endoscopic supraorbital approach using a 1.5-cm keyhole craniotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These cases demonstrate how the application of endoscopic techniques to surgery of the middle cranial base can eliminate the need for traditional open techniques without compromising surgical success </plain></SENT>
