<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study was to show equivalence or superiority of CT venography compared with the existing test of choice--<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venography--in the evaluation of dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and in the identification of cerebral veins and dural sinuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-four patients underwent both CT and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venography of the intracranial venous circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seventeen patients were examined for suspected dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four patients underwent projection venography to assess <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> invasion of a major dural sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The remaining three patients were examined for cavernous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformation</z:hpo>, and an elevated jugular bulb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Without knowledge of the patients' case histories, two radiologists evaluated each CT venogram and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The radiologists then arrived at a consensus regarding the absence or presence of dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Later, the radiologists conducted a second interpretation with knowledge of the patients' clinical histories during which time <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> and CT venograms were compared with regard to the advantages and disadvantages of each imaging technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, the venograms were assessed for the presence of 12 different venous structure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Projection venograms were displayed using a maximum-intensity-projection (MIP) algorithm, and the individual source images were also evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The CT venograms were also displayed using shell-MIP and integral display algorithms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Using <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venography, the two radiologists diagnosed dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> in eight of the 17 patients with suspected dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In these eight patients, the diagnosis was also made with CT venography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis was confirmed by follow-up CT in four patients and by follow-up <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The MIP algorithm did not allow direct visualization of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> by either the CT or the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging technique; however, the CT integral display algorithm enabled direct visualization of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> on the three-dimensional projection venograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The systematic comparison of imaging techniques showed that CT venography reliably reveals <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cerebral veins and sinuses when they are seen with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In addition, CT venography more frequently visualizes sinuses or smaller cerebral veins with low flow as compared with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Cerebral CT venography is superior to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venography in the identification of cerebral veins and dural sinuses and is at least equivalent in the diagnosis of dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>CT venography is a viable alternative to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> venography in the examination of patients with suspected dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
