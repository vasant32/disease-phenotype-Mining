<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective study was carried out between 2002 and 2005, to identify the term breast-fed neonates with serum <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> level &gt; or =150 mEq/L at the Ministry of Health Ankara Diskapi Children's and Research Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004906'>hypernatremic dehydration</z:hpo> secondary to inadequate breast-feeding was 4.1%, occurring in 169 term infants among 4136 hospitalized term neonates with the following characteristics: mean gestational age, 39.1 weeks (37-42 weeks); birthweight, 3352 g (2200-4500 g); mother's age, 26.1 years (17-38 years); <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo>, 15.9% (5.4-32.7%); proportion of spontaneous vaginal deliveries, 75.7%; and proportion of first-time mothers, 74.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Major presenting symptoms were <z:hpo ids='HP_0006579'>neonatal jaundice</z:hpo> (47.3%) and poor infant suck (29.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi>; blood <z:chebi fb="20" ids="16199">urea</z:chebi> nitrogen (BUN); and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> levels on admission were 155 mmol/L (150-194 mmol/L), 35 mg/dL (7-253 mg/dL), and 0.9 mg/dL (0.2-10 mg/dL), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Major complications were as follows: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001919'>acute renal failure</z:hpo>, 82.8%; <z:hpo ids='HP_0002910'>elevated liver enzymes</z:hpo>, 20.7%; <z:hpo ids='HP_0005521'>disseminated intravascular coagulation</z:hpo>, 6.5%; <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo>, 5.2%; <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo>, 3.6%; cavernous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, 1.2%; and bilateral iliac artery <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, 0.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ten patients (5.9%) developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> within the first 24 h of rehydration therapy with a mean <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> decrease of 11.9 mmol/L per day (4-19 mmol/L per day) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two patients (1.2%) died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were positive correlation between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> and serum <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi>, BUN, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> levels (P &lt; 0.01); there was no correlation between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> and mothers' age, education level, delivery route, or first-born status (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0004906'>Hypernatremic dehydration</z:hpo> in neonates due to inadequate breast-feeding is a serious, potentially devastating and life-threatening disorder, and can damage the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Follow up of infants for adequate breast-feeding is important </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Pediatricians must maintain a high level of suspicion, especially in cases of pathologic infant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo> after delivery </plain></SENT>
