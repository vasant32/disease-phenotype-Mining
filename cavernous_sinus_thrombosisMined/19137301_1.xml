<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nineteen patients presented with either direct (13) or dural (6) <z:hpo ids='HP_0004947'>arteriovenous fistula</z:hpo> (AVF) and were treated by means of coil embolization of the cavernous sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of treatment was complete obliteration of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a retrospective study, the degree of obliteration, regression of symptoms as well as complication rates were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Initial complete obliteration was achieved in 12 patients, subtotal occlusion of the sinus in 6 and incomplete packing with major residual <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> in 1 of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Retreatment was successfully performed in two patients with early recurrence of AVF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Follow-up showed complete occlusion rates in 16 and subtotal obliteration in 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Chemosis and exophthalmus regressed rapidly in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> affected patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Persistence of cranial nerve deficits was observed in 11 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Postinterventional <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the ophthalmic vein was the only major <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> complication (n = 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Coil embolization of the cavernous sinus in cases with AVF is a complex procedure that is technically feasible and safe in the majority of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Adequate anticoagulation is recommended to avoid thrombembolic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Long-term outcome has to be determined by further studies </plain></SENT>
