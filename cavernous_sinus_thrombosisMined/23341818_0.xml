<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 64-year-old man with a known history of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> presented to the Accident and Emergency Department with a 2-day history of sudden decreased vision in the right eye </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Temporal <z:hpo ids='HP_0012089'>arteritis</z:hpo> was suspected with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0003565'>elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate</z:hpo> (71 mm/h), and oral <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> was started immediately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four days later, the patient's right eye vision deteriorated from 0.6 to 0.05, with a grade-4 relative afferent pupillary defect and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000602'>ophthalmoplegia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography showed a contrast-enhancing orbital apex mass in the right orbit abutting the medial and lateral portions of the optic nerve with extension to the posterior ethmoid and sphenoid sinuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A transethmoidal biopsy was performed which yielded septate hyphae suggestive of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0851807" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Aspergillus infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ten days later, the patient's right eye vision further deteriorated to hand movement with <z:hpo ids='HP_0007824'>total ophthalmoplegia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MRI of the orbit showed suspicion of cavernous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A combined lateral orbitotomy and transethmoidal orbital apex drainage and decompression were performed to eradicate the orbital apex <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Drained pus cultured Aspergillus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The patient was prescribed systemic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="10023">voriconazole</z:chebi> for a total of 22 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The latest MRI scan, performed 8 months after surgery, showed residual inflammatory changes with no signs of recurrence of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>To our knowledge, this is the first case report which describes the use of a combined open and endoscopic approach for orbital decompression and drainage in a case of orbital <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004030" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aspergillosis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We believe the combined approach gives good exposure to the orbital apex, and allows the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> in this region to be adequately drained </plain></SENT>
