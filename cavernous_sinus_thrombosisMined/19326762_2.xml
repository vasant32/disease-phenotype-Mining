<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: We determined the clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes of an unusual cluster of intracranial complications seen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000265'>mastoiditis</z:hpo> (AM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of pediatric patients treated for AM in a tertiary care hospital from March 2006 to March 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eleven children, 6 months to 10 years of age (mean age, 3.8 years), were treated for AM confirmed by computed tomography, which identified asymptomatic intracranial complications in 8 of the 11 patients: these were sigmoid sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> (4 patients), epidural <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> (4), perisigmoid <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> or bony <z:mpath ids='MPATH_580'>erosion</z:mpath> (2), and tegmen mastoideum dehiscence (1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients required operative intervention with tympanomastoidectomy, although only 2 patients required neurosurgical intervention, consisting of evacuation of epidural <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> and sigmoid sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cultures yielded routine organisms and 1 multidrug-resistant strain of Streptococcus pneumoniae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One patient developed reaccumulation of the subperiosteal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> that required revision mastoidectomy, and another patient developed postoperative sigmoid sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although uncommon, intracranial complications of AM may present without clinical signs or symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography of the temporal bone with contrast is essential for identifying asymptomatic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mastoidectomy remains the mainstay of surgical treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Neurosurgical intervention and anticoagulation may be avoided with protracted postoperative intravenous antibiotics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Postoperative vigilance is crucial, as complications may evolve despite aggressive therapy </plain></SENT>
