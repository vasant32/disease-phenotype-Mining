<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Secondary inflammatory orbital involvement due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011109'>chronic sinusitis</z:hpo> is common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The pneumatized system of the paranasal sinuses is abut to the bones of the orbit in up to 80 percent, therefore the association is a seductive theory due to their anatomic closeness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Typically, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000246'>sinusitis</z:hpo> can influence ocular motility by affecting single muscles or a combination of muscles/cranial nerves due to a local inflammatory tissue reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The expected picture would be a more or less complex restriction of eye movements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this case study nine consecutive patients were prospectively included between January 2006 and August 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Five of the patients did not experience any motility disorder, the other four had a restricted motility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Case reports of the four patients are presented to demonstrate the range of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028850" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ocular motility disorders</z:e> related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000246'>sinusitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Orbital complications due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000246'>sinusitis</z:hpo> include motility disorders among others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>They can even cause orbital <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> and cavernous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On the one hand <z:hpo ids='HP_0000246'>sinusitis</z:hpo> can affect almost the whole spectrum of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028850" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ocular motility disorders</z:e>, on the other hand it may mask a dangerous <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="!"><plain>The "close-lying" connections, as seductive they are, should not divert from the rule: infrequent causes are infrequent and frequent causes are frequent </plain></SENT>
