<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its importance resides in the fact that it is traversed by various elements: internal carotid, and motor and sensory orbit nerves, but also the fundamental venous confluent of the middle stage of the base of the cranium represented by the cavernous sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical symptoms of lesions in this region are determined by the respective positions and anatomical relationships of these different structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis can be established by computed tomography, carotid angiography, and orbital phlebography examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Whereas cavernous sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0004418'>thrombophlebitis</z:hpo> is now very rarely observed, "intrinsic" pathological processes detected involve mainly intracavernous carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> and carotidocavernous fistulae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The identification of the internal carotid intracavernous collaterals, and the increased knowledge of hemodynamic modifications resulting from carotidocavernous fistulae has led to the development of more appropriate endovascular surgical techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These include both elective obstruction of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> and the suppression of its various sources of supply. "Extrinsic" lesions of various origins, represented by different <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> of the base of the cranium, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> of the nasal and retronasal spaces, particularly <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> of the cavum and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e>, make up the greater part of cavernous syndromes </plain></SENT>
