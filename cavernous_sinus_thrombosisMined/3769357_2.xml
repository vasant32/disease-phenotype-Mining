<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Early diagnosis is imperative in order that appropriate treatment be instituted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A 59-year-old woman who was admitted to our institution with complaints of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000651'>diplopia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000622'>blurred vision</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fevers</z:hpo> that developed following a tooth extraction is presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Initial CT and lumbar puncture on the day of admission were totally <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A repeat CT performed 48 hours after admission, on the same day as <z:chebi fb="29" ids="49631">gallium</z:chebi> imaging, demonstrated findings consistent with cavernous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="29" ids="49631">Gallium</z:chebi> imaging demonstrated intense uptake in the left cavernous sinus and left orbit as well as moderately increased activity in the right cavernous sinus and orbit, confirming <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patient was treated with antibiotics, and repeat CT and <z:chebi fb="29" ids="49631">gallium</z:chebi> imaging were performed ten days later, both of which demonstrated near total resolution of the disease process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conceivably, if <z:chebi fb="29" ids="49631">gallium</z:chebi> imaging had been initiated on the day of admission it may have been the first study to demonstrate an infectious process in the cavernous sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="29" ids="49631">Gallium</z:chebi> imaging should be considered as a diagnostic tool in the noninvasive workup of this entity </plain></SENT>
