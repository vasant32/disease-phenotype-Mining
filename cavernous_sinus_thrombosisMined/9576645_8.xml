<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: In autopsy reports of patients who died of septic cavernous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, tributary venosinus occlusion has been a common finding related to intracranial inflammatory complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this article is to illustrate the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> and CT appearance of septic cavernous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and tributary venous occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Over a period of 7 years, eight patients with septic cavernous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> were examined by contrast-enhanced thin-section CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The CT scans of these eight patients and those of 30 healthy control subjects were assessed independently and subjectively by two blinded readers to ascertain the presence, size, and density of areas of nonopacification within the cavernous sinus and the presence of filling defects and dilation of tributary veins and venous sinuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In six subjects, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images supplemented by a contrast-enhanced spoiled gradient-recalled acquisition in the steady state (SPGR) sequence were assessed with respect to the presence of filling defects, expansion, and signal abnormalities within the cavernous sinus and tributary veins and sinuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> and CT findings were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The CT studies of the eight patients were consistently differentiated from those of the control subjects by the two readers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Contrast-enhanced CT findings in patients included areas of nonopacification that were present within the cavernous sinus bilaterally in six cases and unilaterally in two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The size of the filling defects exceeded 7 mm in 76% of thrombosed cavernous sinuses compared with 9% of control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean density of filling defects in patients differed significantly from those in control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Comparison of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> and CT findings in six cases showed the contrast-enhanced SPGR sequence to be equivalent to CT with respect to delineation of filling defects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Contrast-enhanced high-resolution CT findings indicate that venosinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> associated with septic cavernous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> is not restricted to the superior ophthalmic vein and is more common than previously assumed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A contrast-enhanced SPGR <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> sequence may be used as a reliable alternative to establish the diagnosis of cavernous sinus and tributary venosinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
