<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fifteen young patients with orbital <z:hpo ids='HP_0100658'>cellulitis</z:hpo> were examined: they were 13 men and 2 women, whose mean age was 23 years, with orbital <z:hpo ids='HP_0100658'>cellulitis</z:hpo> secondary to fronto-ethmoidal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000246'>sinusitis</z:hpo> (10 cases), to maxillary <z:hpo ids='HP_0000246'>sinusitis</z:hpo> (4 cases) and to craniofacial trauma (1 case) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On the basis of CT findings the patients were divided into two groups according to whether the inflammatory process involved the preseptal (4 cases) or the postseptal (11 cases) space; postseptal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100658'>cellulitis</z:hpo> was classified as orbital <z:hpo ids='HP_0100658'>cellulitis</z:hpo> and subperiosteal abscesses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The site of the inflammatory process must always be accurately located because orbital septum integrity does affect treatment choice, which in our series was medical in preseptal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100658'>cellulitis</z:hpo> and always surgical in subperiosteal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After describing the CT patterns of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100658'>cellulitis</z:hpo> and its possible complications, the authors emphasize the role of CT as the method of choice to confirm clinical diagnosis and to demonstrate the site, the extent and the complications of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> orbital <z:hpo ids='HP_0100658'>cellulitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
