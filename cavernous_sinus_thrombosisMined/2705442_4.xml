<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To determine the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001894'>thrombocytosis</z:hpo> at presentation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL), medical records of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> children diagnosed at the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh from 1980 to 1987 were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Out of 217 such patients, 7 (3.2%) had platelet counts greater than 400,000/mm3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the seven were boys compared with a male:female ration of 1.4:1 in the entire ALL population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Other than sex, no characteristics were clearly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001894'>thrombocytosis</z:hpo>, including white blood cell count, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>, lymphoblast <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, and immunologic or chromosomal markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Apart from ALL, no inflammatory or infectious process which might have caused a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001894'>thrombocytosis</z:hpo>, was detected in any of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The period of induction therapy was notable for the preservation of platelet counts greater than 20,000/mm3 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, of the seven children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001894'>thrombocytosis</z:hpo>, two had major induction complications: one, a cavernous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>; and the other, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002239'>gastrointestinal bleeding</z:hpo> with duodenal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_81'>perforation</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001894'>thrombocytosis</z:hpo> at diagnosis can be seen in children, particularly boys, with ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Based on small numbers, this group of patients may be at risk for major events during induction therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Large numbers, longer follow-up, and platelet function studies on similar patients will be of interest </plain></SENT>
