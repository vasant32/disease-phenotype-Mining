<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Septic <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the cavernous sinus (CST) is a rare and potentially life-threatening condition mostly caused by facial or ear, nose, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0729771" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">throat infections</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Anatomic structures in vicinity of the cavernous sinus are thereby susceptible to inflammatory damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In particular <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system structures are almost regularly affected; however, only few authors reported severe involvement of the internal carotid artery (ICA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CASE PRESENTATION: We present an atypical clinical course of CST in a 61-year-old male diabetic patient caused by a distant focus of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Septic CST after surgical treatment of an anorectal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> was complicated by occlusion of the ICA and multiple embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis was established by magnetic resonance imaging scan, symptoms resolved after antibiotic therapy and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The presented case and review of literature emphasizes the variability of signs and clinical course of CST, a frequent cause of delayed diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Especially in immunocompromised patients, the primary source of CST may be a distant inflammatory focus with nonspecific and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Septic CST can be a rare cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> when complicated by ICA occlusion because of septic <z:hpo ids='HP_0012089'>arteritis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Expedited diagnostic workup is necessary and rests upon radiologic investigations </plain></SENT>
