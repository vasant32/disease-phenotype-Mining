<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Surveys were mailed to members of the American Rhinologic Society with practices in both academic centers and/or private settings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Survey results were then assessed and tabulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were 635 mailings, with 197 responses (31%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seventy-two (36% of respondents) indicated that they performed endoscopic management of CSF leaks and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002084'>encephaloceles</z:hpo>, while 125 (64% of respondents) did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Respondents reported approximately 522 cases of CSF leaks and approximately 128 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002084'>encephaloceles</z:hpo> managed by endoscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Success rates after a single procedure were estimated at 90% for CSF leaks and 93% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002084'>encephaloceles</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Success rates after a secondary procedure were estimated at 86% and 97%, respectively; 29% of respondents have, at some point, made a referral to neurosurgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A total of 13 complications related to endoscopic repairs were reported (2.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For CSF leak repair, complications included <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, 0.2%; <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo>, 1.1%; and one reported case each of cavernous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, temporary visual problems, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000246'>sinusitis</z:hpo>, and intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>/bleed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was only one reported <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in the approximately 522 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Eleven complications following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002084'>encephalocele</z:hpo> repairs (8.5%) included <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, 3.1%; <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo>, 2.3%; and one reported case each of brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000246'>sinusitis</z:hpo>, false <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of middle cerebral artery, and mild dizziness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002084'>encephalocele</z:hpo> repair were reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The endoscopic management of CSF leaks and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002084'>encephaloceles</z:hpo> has become increasingly popular and has proven to have low morbidity and mortality with high success </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Overall, our results confirm that in the hands of the skilled endoscopist, endoscopic management of CSF leaks and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002084'>encephaloceles</z:hpo> is highly efficacious and has a very low incidence of significant complication </plain></SENT>
