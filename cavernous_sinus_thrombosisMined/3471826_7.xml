<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The clinical picture of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> orbit, as manifest by preseptal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100658'>cellulitis</z:hpo>, subperiosteal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> or orbital <z:hpo ids='HP_0100658'>cellulitis</z:hpo>, is still frequently seen in ENT practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The commonest cause is <z:hpo ids='HP_0000246'>sinusitis</z:hpo> and the authors advocate early surgical intervention in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> orbits due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000246'>sinusitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinically, it can be difficult to distinguish between a subperiosteal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> and orbital <z:hpo ids='HP_0100658'>cellulitis</z:hpo> and a CAT scan may be helpful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Surgically, a subperiosteal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> is the more important (and probably more frequent) entity as it may require drainage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It may be suspected in an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> orbit which progresses rapidly or fails to settle on treatment and it may require drainage to allow the condition to resolve and avoid potentially damaging sequelae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A classification of the stages of the inflammatory processes seen in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> orbit is given and the management of 34 cases due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000246'>sinusitis</z:hpo> is discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The other causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> orbits are discussed and the further complications that may occur are also mentioned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000618'>Blindness</z:hpo>, cavernous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and cerebral involvement are still frequently recorded and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> may still occur </plain></SENT>
