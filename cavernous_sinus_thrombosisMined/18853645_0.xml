<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Early, appropriate evaluation and management observing signs and symptoms of orbital <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> are required to prevent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000618'>blindness</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Computerised tomography (CT) is the investigation of choice in diagnosing the discussed pathological conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100658'>Cellulitis</z:hpo> does not require drainage of the orbit on a routine basis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Conventionally, the orbital <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> is drained via an external incision and sinus surgery is performed at the same time to remove the focus of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>More recently, successful treatment both of the sinuses and decompression of the orbit has been accomplished endoscopically via an intranasal approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Aim: The aim of the paper was to analyse the results of intranasal endoscopic procedures performed in individuals with orbital complications of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000246'>sinusitis</z:hpo> in search for optimal treatment of this group of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Records of 7 patients aged from 14 to 68 (mean 33) years treated in our department for orbital complications of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000246'>sinusitis</z:hpo> between February 2005 and August 2006 were analysed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One retrobulbar <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> was diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the remaining 6 patients the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100658'>cellulitis</z:hpo>, in one case complicated with cavernous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, was established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>7 endoscopic frontosphenoethmoidectomies, one with endonasal decompression of the orbital <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath>, were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> preoperative symptoms subsided in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> operated individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No complications were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Surgical treatment of the focus of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> in the sinuses and drainage of orbital <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> can be accomplished endoscopically via an intranasal approach with little morbidity, easy identification of anatomical structures, physiological drainage of the sinuses and superior cosmetic result </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Our experience suggests that the optimal method of treatment consists in surgical endoscopic removal of the focus of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> located in the sinuses with simultaneous drainage of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> in the orbit </plain></SENT>
