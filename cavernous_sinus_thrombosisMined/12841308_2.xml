<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective chart analysis of asphyxiated neonates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING, PATIENTS AND INTERVENTION: During a period of 13 months (1st June 1998 to 30 June 1999) fourteen newborns (10 mild and 4 moderate PHIE) were managed by selective head-cooling (mean GA 38.8 +/- 2.3) and 12 newborns (9 mild and 3 moderate PHIE) were managed conservatively without head cooling and served as controls (mean GA 39.1 +/- 1.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Selective head cooling was accomplished by applying cool-packs to the parieto-temporal regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the perinatal characteristics of the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean scalp temperature of 33.8 +/- 0.4 degrees C (28.7-36.5 degrees C) was lower than the mean body temperature of 35.8 +/- 0.2 degrees C (32.2-37.0 degrees C) in the study group during the cooling period, compared to a mean body temperature of 36.7 +/- 0.2 degrees C (36.1-37.3 degrees C) in the control group during the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in the incidence of possible adverse effects between the two groups of infants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No infants developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100598'>pulmonary edema</z:hpo> or <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001942'>metabolic acidosis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002900'>hypokalemia</z:hpo>, NEC, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0243026" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">systemic infection</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001901'>polycythemia</z:hpo>, or cavernous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> during cooling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrates that selective head cooling is practical and effective in keeping a gradient between the scalp and body temperature with no observed systemic side effects </plain></SENT>
