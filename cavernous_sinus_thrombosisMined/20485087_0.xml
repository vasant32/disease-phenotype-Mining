<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The signs and symptoms of IOM may also be seen in such processes as orbital <z:hpo ids='HP_0100658'>cellulitis</z:hpo>, primary or metastatic orbital <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo>, carotid-cavernous fistulae, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformations</z:hpo>, cavernous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0339143" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thyroid eye disease</z:e>, and because there is no pathognomonic sign, symptoms, laboratory test, or radiologic findings, its diagnosis is often provisional </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In our case, diagnosis of IOM was more difficult because our patient presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000520'>proptosis</z:hpo> after alloplastic implant insertion in the blow-out fracture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After considering radiologic and physical findings, we concluded that <z:hpo ids='HP_0100658'>cellulitis</z:hpo> was more likely as initial diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To remove foreign body or pus, surgical exploration was done, but intraoperative findings did not show any pus or sign of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> but diffuse enlargement and swelling of inferior rectus muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis was confirmed as IOM, and the patient was treated with systemic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0000520'>proptosis</z:hpo> after alloplastic insertion in blow-out fracture is usually a sign of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100658'>cellulitis</z:hpo>, this case illustrates that it may also occur in patients with IOM </plain></SENT>
