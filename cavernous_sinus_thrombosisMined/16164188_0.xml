<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report, with serial angiograms, a case worsening of dural arteriovenous fistulae (DAVFs) located at the hypoplastic right cavernous sinus and draining into the left superior ophthalmic vein across the inter-cavernous sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patient presented with sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000544'>external ophthalmoplegia</z:hpo> and deterioration of visual acuity on the left </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An imaging work-up at the day of admission included contrast-enhanced computed tomography and conventional catheter angiography, which demonstrated complete <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the left cavernous sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was no strong evidence to suggest DAVFs other than small faint opacification of the posterior cavernous sinus on the right at the late arterial phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For this reason a diagnosis of left cavernous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was made, followed by aggressive anticoagulation therapy with intravenous administration of antibiotics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although the patient's eye symptoms improved significantly after the anticoagulation therapy, the follow-up angiogram obtained 5 days after admission demonstrated small right cavernous sinus DAVFs, which drained into the left superior ophthalmic vein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patient was followed up conservatively at the out-patient clinic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three-month follow up angiograms demonstrated spontaneous cure of the DAVF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Also noted was a complete recovery of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000544'>external ophthalmoplegia</z:hpo> with significant improvement of left visual acuity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The alternation of clinical and angiographic findings in this case may help to understand the etiology of paradoxical worsening of cavernous sinus DAVF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In selected cases, anticoagulation therapy may help to improve the prognosis of paradoxical worsening </plain></SENT>
