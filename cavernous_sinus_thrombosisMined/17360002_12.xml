<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Intracranial infectious <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> (IA) are infrequent, but can be fatal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To compare the clinical profile of IAs associated with intravascular/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0243026" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">systemic infection</z:e> like infective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> with that associated with local <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> like <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo>, orbital <z:hpo ids='HP_0100658'>cellulitis</z:hpo> and cavernous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analysed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of IA, treated in this Institute from 1976 to 2003, in order to identify prognostic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 25 persons (mean age 24.8+/-17.3 years, males 17) with 29 IA (carotid circulation 19, vertebrobasilar circulation 10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>Headache</z:hpo> (83%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> (67%) were the most common presenting symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast to noninfectious <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, intracerebral haemorrhage (60%) and focal signs were more common than <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> (7%) with IA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sources of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> were cardiac (10), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> (12), orbital <z:hpo ids='HP_0100658'>cellulitis</z:hpo> (2) or uncertain (1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Infective agents included bacteria (18), fungi (4), and tubercle bacilli (3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fifteen IA were distal and 14 were proximal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>IAs associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> were proximal (75%) while those associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac diseases</z:e> preferentially involved carotid territory and were distal (p=0.013) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The overall mortality was 32% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Survivors were younger than those who expired (p=0.015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Of the sixteen patients treated medically, seven recovered (44%), others (56%) had treatment failure (three died and six required surgery later) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Another five patients underwent early surgery (one died) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Mortality of IA was significantly higher with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo>, fungal aetiology and vertebrobasilar location </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: IAs associated with local <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> like <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> had different clinical profile as compared to IAs associated with intravascular/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0243026" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">systemic infections</z:e> like infective <z:hpo ids='HP_0100584'>endocarditis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
