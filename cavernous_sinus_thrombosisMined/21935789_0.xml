<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this report a fatal case of sino-orbital <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004030" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aspergillosis</z:e> developed in an immunocompetent patient has been presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seventy-four years old female patient was admitted to the hospital with the complaints of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> and progressively increasing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> that continued for 15 days </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Direct microscopic examination of the Gram and acidfast staining of the CSF sample revealed no microorganisms, no growth was detected in CSF culture and PCR amplification was negative for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019348" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Herpes simplex</z:e> virus and Mycobacterium <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041296" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tb|tbc">tuberculosis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Since no response was achieved by empirical <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29007">ceftriaxone</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="28971">ampicillin</z:chebi> and conventional anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041296" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tb|tbc">tuberculosis</z:e> treatment and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002789'>tachypnea</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000520'>proptosis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004893'>progressive respiratory failure</z:hpo> developed in the patient, she was transferred to the intensive care unit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The radiological examination revealed soft tissue lesion filling the sphenoid sinus, extending to the nasal cavity and suprasellar cistern, destruction of bones, dilated orbital vein, cavernous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> and infarction on left cerebral peduncule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patient was operated and pus and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0333040" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fungus ball</z:e> were aspirated from the openings of both sphenoid sinuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Gomori <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6824">methenamine</z:chebi> silver, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29149">periodic acid</z:chebi>-Schiff and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">haematoxylin</z:chebi>-eosine staining of the operational material exhibited dichotomously branching hyphae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The patient was diagnosed as invasive sino-orbital <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004030" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aspergillosis</z:e> based on the clinical, radiological and histopathological findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Despite antifungal therapy and surgical debridement, the patient died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It should always be kept in mind that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004030" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aspergillosis</z:e> can develop in immuncompetent individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Delay in diagnosis and treatment may lead to fatality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Thus multidiciplinary approach is necessary for early diagnosis and successful treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0851807" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aspergillus infections</z:e> </plain></SENT>
