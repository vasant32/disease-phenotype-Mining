<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These symptoms, though highly suspicious of carotid cavernous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath>, were caused by an <z:hpo ids='HP_0004947'>arteriovenous fistula</z:hpo> (AVF) between the inferolateral trunk (ILT) and the ophthalmic veins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A direct AVF at the branch of the ILT without involvement of the cavernous sinus is extremely rare, but could occur in the case of acquired AVF since the ILT has some branches around venous structures outside the cavernous sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The clinical implications of this case are discussed in terms of the anatomical aspects </plain></SENT>
