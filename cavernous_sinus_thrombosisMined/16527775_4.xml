<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Septic <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the cavernous sinus is a rare condition that may lead to significant morbidity and mortality if not diagnosed and treated urgently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present two recent cases of bilateral septic cavernous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> with differing etiologies, the first of dental origin and the second a complication of sphenoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0000246'>sinusitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Case report </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A diagnosis of cavernous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was made based on clinical findings and confirmed by imaging in both patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The etiology in the first patient was related to poor dental hygiene, with resultant spread of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> to the cavernous sinuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The second had bilateral sphenoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0000246'>sinusitis</z:hpo>, with intravascular gas noted in both orbits and cavernous sinuses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This is the first reported occurrence of such an event associated with septic cavernous sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Bilateral sphenoidotomies with evacuation of the sinuses were performed, and Haemophilus influenzae was cultured from the sphenoidotomy fluid and blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Broad spectrum intravenous antibiotics were given in both patients, and complete recovery achieved within weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In septic <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the cavernous sinus, early recognition and prompt management with broad spectrum intravenous antibiotics is crucial for full recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The primary source of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> may be a distant focus with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_681'>septicemia</z:mpath> preceding <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the cavernous sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> may spread from facial regions via the facial venous plexus or from the sphenoid sinus directly to the adjacent cavernous sinus </plain></SENT>
