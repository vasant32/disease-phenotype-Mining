<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A neurological examination revealed 3rd and 6th right <z:hpo ids='HP_0006824'>cranial nerve palsies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and 3D-computed tomography (CT) angiography (CTA) showed right-sided sphenoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0000246'>sinusitis</z:hpo>, cavernous sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0004418'>thrombophlebitis</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> in the right intracavernous carotid artery and in a portion of internal carotid-posterior communicating artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We diagnosed her condition as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271347" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cavernous sinus syndrome</z:e> with an infectious <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> secondary to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1408637" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sphenoiditis</z:e>; therefore, broad spectrum antibiotics were administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, 7 days after admission, she died of massive <z:hpo ids='HP_0000421'>epistaxis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Macroscopically, coagulated blood was observed at the surface of the sphenoid sinus, suggesting <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> in the cavernous sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A histopathological examination revealed severe infiltration of the inflammatory cells into the cavernous sinus and sphenoid mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Rupture of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> in the cavernous sinus was also observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, no pathogenic organism was identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We thought that the sphenoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0000246'>sinusitis</z:hpo> had spread through the venous flow into the cavernous, and the infectious <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> developed due to infiltration of inflammatory cells into the arterial wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This is the first detailed clinico-pathological study of an infectious <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> in the intracavernous internal carotid artery occurring concomitantly with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1408637" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sphenoiditis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
