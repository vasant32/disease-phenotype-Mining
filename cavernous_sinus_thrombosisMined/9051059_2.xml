<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Seven of the eight petrous apices studied were diploeic (n = 5), or pneumatic (n = 2) and had venules coursing in the anterior petrous apex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These venules form conduits connecting the cavernous to the inferior petrosal sinus or the jugular bulb and have not been previously described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition to the air cell system of the petrous apex, these venules may represent pathways for the spread of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and the development of petrous apicitis, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018121" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gradenigo's syndrome</z:e>, and the rare otogenic cavernous sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0004418'>thrombophlebitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Their presence also may help explain the location of cholesterol granulomas, which afflict this area of the skull base </plain></SENT>
