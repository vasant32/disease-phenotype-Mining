Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy with significant hypertrophy of the basal septum is the most frequently reported cause of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO) in the mechanism of systolic anterior movement (SAM). Additionally, other conditions such as dehydration, vasodilatation, mitral valve repair, dobutamine stress echocardiography and pheochromocytoma have been associated with LVOTO. In this report, we present a case of a patient without hypertrophic cardiomyopathy who developed severe LVOTO in the SAM mechanism. The presented case serves as a reminder that hypovolaemia together with hyperdynamic state resulting from increased catecholemines may result in the development of dynamic LVOTO.
