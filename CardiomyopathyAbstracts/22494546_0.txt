Citrullinemia is a urea cycle defect requiring long-term care with nutritional and pharmacological management. Despite treatment, morbidity and mortality of this disease remain high, and long-term complications include mild to profound mental retardation, seizures, and growth deficiency. We report a 31-year old woman with classic, neonatal-onset citrullinemia who developed progressive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and cataracts, neither of which has been recognized previously as a complication of the disease or a consequence of long-term drug treatment.
