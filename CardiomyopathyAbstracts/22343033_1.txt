 BACKGROUND: We investigated the effects of asialoerythropoietin (asialoEPO), a nonerythrogenic erythropoietin derivative, on 3 murine models of heart failure with different etiologies. METHODS AND RESULTS: Doxorubicin (15 mg/kg) induced heart failure within 2 weeks (toxic cardiomyopathy). Treatment with asialoEPO (6.9 μg/kg) for 2 weeks thereafter attenuated the associated left ventricular dysfunction and dilatation. In addition, the asialoEPO-treated heart showed less myocardial fibrosis, inflammation, and oxidative damage, and diminished atrophic cardiomyocyte degeneration, which was accompanied by restored expression of GATA-4 and sarcomeric proteins. Mice with large 6-week-old myocardial infarctions exhibited marked left ventricular dysfunction with adverse remodeling (ischemic cardiomyopathy). AsialoEPO treatment for 4 weeks significantly mitigated progression of the dysfunction and remodeling and reduced myocardial fibrosis, inflammation, and oxidative damage. Finally, 25-week-old δ-sarcoglycan-deficient mice (genetic cardiomyopathy) were treated with asialoEPO for 5 weeks. AsialoEPO mitigated the progressive cardiac remodeling and dysfunction through cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, and upregulated expression of GATA-4 and sarcomeric proteins. AsialoEPO appears to act by altering the activity of the downstream erythropoietin receptor signals extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase, Akt, signal transducer, and activator of transcription 3 and 5 in a model-specific manner. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that asialoEPO exerts broad cardioprotective effects through distinct mechanisms depending on the model, which are independent of the erythrogenic action. This compound may be promising for the treatment of heart failure of various etiologies.
