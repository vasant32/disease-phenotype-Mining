 BACKGROUND: Left ventricular assist device (LVAD) support as bridge to recovery (BTR) is uncommon for subjects with chronic heart failure. Myocardial recovery is more evident in recent onset nonischemic cardiomyopathy (ROCM); however, the prevalence of BTR in this subset has not been addressed. METHODS AND RESULTS: We examined the use of LVAD support for subjects with ROCM in the Intervention in Myocarditis and Acute Cardiomyopathy 2 (IMAC2) study. The overall cohort (n = 373) was 38% female, 21% black, with a mean age of 45 ± 14 years. LVAD support was used in 3.8% (n = 14, 43% female, age 32 ± 10). Of LVAD subjects, 57% (8/14) were BTR, including 73% (8/11) of subjects with symptoms ≤4 months at the time of support. Left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD) was smaller in BTR than nonrecovered (NR) subjects (P = .04). Myocardial inflammation was more common in BTR (75% versus 0%, P = .005), whereas fibrosis was less evident (25% versus 100%, P = .005). Of BTR subjects, 7/8 (87.5%) were alive and free of transplant with median follow-up of 19 months. CONCLUSION: In a multicenter registry of ROCM, BTR was common and occurred in the majority of subjects requiring LVAD support. Histology and LVEDD may assist in predicting potential for BTR in ROCM.
