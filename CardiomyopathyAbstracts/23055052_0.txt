We describe a patient with acute heart failure shortly after pacemaker implantation. With the documentation of typical dyskinesia of the apical segments with hyperdynamic contractility of the basal segments and a normal coronary angiogram, pacemaker implantation-induced Takotsubo cardiomyopathy was diagnosed. Supportive care was administered and within several days the patient's symptoms resolved. After several weeks, the left ventricular function had fully recovered. A review of the literature on Takotsubo cardiomyopathy after pacemaker implantation is presented.
