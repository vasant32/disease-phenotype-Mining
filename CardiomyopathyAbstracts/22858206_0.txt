We present an unusual case of ventricular fibrillation in a conscious patient symptomatic for chest pain and shortness of breath. Almost 20years ago he underwent heterotopic cardiac transplantation for the treatment of severe idiopathic cardiomyopathy. In the precyclosporine era, this technique was extremely useful because of the high rate of graft rejection in which the maintenance of the native heart could prevent patient death. To date, with the improvements in immunosuppressive therapy, it is generally reserved to a specific subset of conditions. A coronary angiography and a cardiac MRI confirmed the diagnosis. Six months follow-up ECG was unchanged suggesting the persistence of a double heart rhythm in the same body.
