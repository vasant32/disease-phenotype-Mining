Sudden Cardiac Death (SCD) is a major and tragic complication of a number of cardiovascular diseases. While in the older populations, SCD is most frequently caused by underlying coronary artery disease and heart failure, in those aged under 40 years, the causes of SCD commonly include genetic disorders, such as inherited cardiomyopathies and primary arrhythmogenic diseases. As part of the evaluation of families in which SCD has occurred, the role of genetic testing has evolved as an important feature in both establishing an underlying diagnosis and in screening at-risk family relatives. Specifically, in cases where no definitive cause is identified at postmortem, i.e. Sudden Unexpected Death (SUD), the "molecular autopsy" has emerged as a key process in the investigation of the cause of death. The combination of clinical and genetic evaluation of families in which SUD has occurred provides a platform for early initiation of therapeutic and prevention strategies, with the ultimate goal to reduce sudden death among the young in our communities.
