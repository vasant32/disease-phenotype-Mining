AimsArrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is a primary heart muscle disorder associated with sudden cardiac death. Its pathophysiology is still poorly understood. We aimed to produce an in vitro cellular model of ARVC using patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes and determine whether the model could recapitulate key features of the disease phenotype.Methods and resultsDermal fibroblasts were obtained from a 30-year-old man with a clinical diagnosis of ARVC, harbouring a plakophilin 2 (PKP2) gene mutation. Four stable iPSC lines were generated using retroviral reprogramming, and functional cardiomyocytes were derived. Gene expression levels of desmosomal proteins (PKP2 and plakoglobin) in cardiomyocytes from ARVC-iPSCs were significantly lower compared with cardiomyocytes from control iPSCs (P< 0.01); there were no significant differences in the expression of desmoplakin, N-cadherin, and connexin 43 between the two groups. Cardiomyocytes derived from ARVC-iPSCs exhibited markedly reduced immunofluorescence signals when stained for PKP2 and plakoglobin, but similar levels of staining for desmoplakin, N-cadherin, and connexin 43 compared with control cardiomyocytes. Transmission electron microscopy showed that ARVC-iPSC cardiomyocytes were larger and contained darker lipid droplets compared with control cardiomyocytes. After 2 weeks of cell exposure to adiopgenic differentiation medium, ARVC-iPSC cardiomyocytes were found to contain a significantly greater amount of lipid, calculated using Oil Red O staining, compared with controls (734 ± 35.6 vs. 8.1 ± 0.49 a.u., respectively; n = 7, P = 0.001).ConclusionPatient-specific iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes display key features of ARVC, including reduced cell surface localization of desmosomal proteins and a more adipogenic phenotype.
