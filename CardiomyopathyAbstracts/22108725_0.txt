Structural cardiac volume overload comprises a group of heterogeneous diseases, each creating a nearly unique set of loading conditions on the left ventricle and/or right ventricle. In turn, the heart responds to each with unique patterns of remodeling, leading to both adaptive and maladaptive consequences. An understanding of these different patterns of hypertrophy and/or remodeling should be useful in developing strategies for the timing and correction of cardiac volume overload.
