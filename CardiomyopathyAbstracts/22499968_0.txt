A 61-year-old man with ischemic cardiomyopathy underwent orthotopic heart transplantation. On routine coronary angiography 1 year later, a huge fistula was seen between the left anterior descending coronary artery and the right ventricle. When the patient developed symptoms of ischemia 8 years later, the fistula was successfully closed percutaneously, using a covered stent.
