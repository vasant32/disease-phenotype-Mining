Coexistence of aortic disease is an uncommon finding in end-stage heart failure patients requiring left ventricular assist device (LVAD) placement. A 38-year-old man with non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy was admitted in stage D heart failure. Preoperative computed tomography demonstrated multiple saccular aneurysms of the ascending aorta and sinus of valsalva. We successfully performed complex aortic surgery and the implantation of a continuous-flow LVAD (HeartWare HVAD) (HeartWare International, Framingham, MA). The postoperative course was uneventful. The patient is currently listed for heart transplantation.
