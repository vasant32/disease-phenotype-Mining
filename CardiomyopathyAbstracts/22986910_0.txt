To further understand chronic heart disease, such as heart failure and cardiomyopathy, we must fully define signaling pathways within the myocardium. Recent studies suggest that some forms of heart disease are associated with a chronic low-grade inflammation that promotes adverse ventricular remodeling and correlates with disease progression. Several inflammatory mediators, including TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6, are involved in cardiac injury subsequent to myocardial ischemia and reperfusion, sepsis, viral myocarditis, and transplant rejection. Once activated, components of the inflammatory response can have both beneficial and deleterious effects on the heart. In this review, we discuss the complex inflammatory signaling pathways in the myocardium and potential therapeutic implications.
