 BACKGROUND: Primary hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most common feline heart disease and has been demonstrated to be inherited in some breeds. However, few studies have compared HCM phenotypes and survival according to breed. OBJECTIVES: To compare epidemiological characteristics, clinical findings, left ventricular (LV) geometric patterns, and survival in several breeds of cats with HCM. ANIMALS: Three hundred and forty-four cats from 5 different breeds (Persian, Domestic Shorthair [DS], Sphynx, Maine coon [MC], and Chartreux) with primary HCM diagnosed by conventional echocardiography. METHODS: Retrospective study. Cats were classified according to breed and clinical status. RESULTS: Age at the time of diagnosis was lower (P < .001) in MC (median age, 2.5 years) and Sphynx (3.5 years) than in other breeds (OB), ie, 8.0, 8.0, and 11.0 years for DS, Chartreux, and Persians, respectively. The prevalence of LV outflow tract obstruction was higher (P < .001) in Persians (23/41; 56%) than in OB (115/303; 38%). Age at the first cardiac event was lower (P < .01) in MC (median age, 2.5 years) than in OB (7.0 years). All cats surviving > 15 years of age were DS, Persians, or Chartreux. Sudden death (representing 24% of all cardiac deaths) was observed only in 3 breeds (DS, MC, and Sphynx). CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: As in humans, feline HCM is characterized by marked phenotypic variability with several breed-dependent features regarding epidemiology, LV geometric patterns, and clinical course (ie, age at diagnosis, 1st cardiac event, and cause of death).
