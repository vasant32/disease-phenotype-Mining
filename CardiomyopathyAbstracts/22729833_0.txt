BACKGROUND.: Left atrial appendage (LAA) may be a source of thrombi in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy at sinus rhythm. The objectives of our study were to assess the prevalence of intracardiac left chamber thrombus and/or spontaneous echo contrast and to identify clinical and echocardiographic predictors for left ventricle (LV), left atrium (LA), and/or LAA thrombus formation, particularly as regard to LV, LA, and LAA size, in heart failure patients at sinus rhythm. METHODS.: We included 45 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy of ischemic or idiopathic origin with mild to moderate systolic dysfunction, who were at sinus rhythm and without anticoagulation therapy. RESULTS.: Mean left ventricular end diastolic diameter was 64.9 ± 6.1 mm, and mean LV ejection fraction was 39.9 ± 7.3%. LV thrombus was found in 13.3% of patients and LAA thrombus in 68. 9%. Left ventricular end diastolic diameter was correlated with LA volume (r = 0.59, p < 0.0001) and LV thrombus (r = 0.38, p = 0.005). LA volume was correlated with LAA maximal area (r = 0.34, p = 0.01), which was an independent predictor for LAA thrombus formation (p = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS.: Dilation of left cardiac chambers offers a suitable terrain for thrombus formation. The high probability of LAA thrombosis should be kept in mind when designing the treatment strategy for patients with dilated cardiomyopathy at sinus rhythm. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
