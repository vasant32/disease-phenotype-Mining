A patient with a dilated cardiomyopathy underwent successful implantation of a cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator. The device system included an active fixation lead placed at the right ventricular (RV) apex. Pacing from the RV apex unexpectedly led to left-sided intercostal muscle stimulation and twitching. This intercostal muscle twitching resolved completely with movement of the lead to the RV outflow tract.
