One of the diagnostic challenges in cardiology is the assessment of patients with suspected cardiomyopathies. The traditional approach involves clinical history and examination, followed by echocardiography and invasive angiography. Advances in cardiac MRI enable cardiologists to comprehensively assess both ischemic and nonischemic cardiomyopathies, providing information regarding cardiac anatomy, myocardial and valve functions, as well as tissue characterization.
