The congenital nephrotic syndrome (NS) in infancy and childhood is an important entity but combination with acyanotic congenital heart disease is uncommon. Anesthesia in such cases is challenging because of associated problems like hypo-protienemia, anti-thrombin III deficiency, edema, hyperlipidemia, coagulopathy, cardiomyopathy, immunodeficiency, increased lung water etc. We describe anesthetic management of a patient with childhood NS and sinus venosus atrial septal defect (ASD) undergoing open heart surgery. We also suggest guidelines for safe conduct of anesthesia and CPB in such patients.
