Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an incurable, rapidly-worsening neuromuscular degenerative disease caused by the absence of dystrophin. In skeletal muscle, lack of dystrophin disrupts the recruitment of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) to the sarcolemma thus affecting nitric oxide (NO) production. Utrophin is a dystrophin homolog whose expression is greatly upregulated in the sarcolemma of dystrophin-negative fibers from mdx mice, a mouse model of DMD. Although cardiomyopathy is an important cause of death, little is known about the NO signaling pathway in cardiac muscle of DMD patients. Thus, we used cardiomyocytes and hearts from two month-old mdx and mdx:utrophin (-/-) double knockout mice (mdx:utr) to study key steps in NO signaling: L-arginine transporters, NOS, and soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC). nNOS did not co-localize with dystrophin or utrophin to the cardiomyocyte membrane. Despite this, nNOS activity was markedly decreased in both mdx and mdx:utr mice while nNOS expression was only decreased in mdx:utr hearts, suggesting that utrophin upregulation in cardiomyocytes maintains nNOS levels but not function. sGC protein levels and activity remained at control levels. Unexpectedly, L-arginine transporter expression and function were significantly increased, suggesting a novel biochemical compensatory mechanism of the NO pathway and a potential entry site for therapeutics.
