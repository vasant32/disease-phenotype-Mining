This review discusses cardiac consequences of pressure overload. In response to elevated pressure, the ventricular hypertrophy compensates for the increased wall stress. However, the ventricular hypertrophy involves numerous structural adaptations that may lead to ventricular dysfunction and, eventually, heart failure. Particular emphasis is placed on molecular mechanisms that govern the development of hypertrophy and that may lead to maladaptive structural changes resulting in adverse cardiac events.
