AIMS: Trimetazidine is an anti-ischemic metabolic agent which improves myocardial glucose utilization. Whether it may improve cardiac function and physical tolerance in diabetic patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy is still not confirmed. In this study we have investigated the effectiveness of trimetazidine in these patients. MAIN METHODS: Volunteers with diabetes and idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy were recruited for participation in this study. Patients were randomized into two groups. One group received trimetazidine (20mg, t.i.d.) for 6months (n=40), while another group received a placebo during the same period (n=40). All patients received an echocardiographic examination, 6-minute walk test and an inflammation biochemical analysis (C reactive protein) at baseline and after 6months of treatment. KEY FINDINGS: No significant adverse events or changes in clinical or biochemical parameters were detected through the study. After 6months, TMZ-treated patients had a significant improvement in systolic function as compared with control patients associated with an increased ratio of E/A. C reactive protein concentrations remained stable throughout the study in trimetazidine group at baseline and at the 6month on follow up. In comparison, it increased significantly in the control group at the 6-month follow up. The NT-pro BNP levels did not change in the control group, whereas they significantly decreased in the trimetazidine group. The physical activity tolerance level improved in the trimetazidine group compared to the control group. SIGNIFICANCE: Trimetazidine treatment was associated with a significant improvement of cardiac function and physical tolerance. Results also suggested that the inflammatory response was decreased in trimetazidine group as compared with control patients.
