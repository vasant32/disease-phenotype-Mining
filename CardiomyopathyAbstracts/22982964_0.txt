We appreciate the Letter to the Editor by Drs. Martins and Baruteua regarding our recent manuscript describing antitachycardia pacing (ATP) in children and congenital heart disease (CHD) patients.(1) The comment regarding the adequate number of ATP sequences to program in this population is an excellent one that is, as yet, unanswered. It has become our practice over time to program more ATP attempts, as the growing ATP literature (albeit primarily in adults with ischemic or dilated cardiomyopathy) continues to support the safety and efficacy of such a strategy. Further support for this strategy in children and CHD patients is provided by the lack of symptoms in the few patients in our study who had successful termination by the 4(th), 5(th), and 8(th) ATP sequence. As noted, a limitation of our retrospective analysis is the non-uniform ATP programming across the study population, enrolled over a 14 year period during which we initially programmed 1 or 2 ATP attempts and more recently programmed multiple sequences. Thus, we are unable to determine definitively the optimal number of ATP sequences to program in children and CHD patients. We agree that a prospective study, similar to the one performed by Martins et al.(2) (included as a reference and in Table 2 of our manuscript), is warranted. This would require a multicenter effort to obtain an adequately powered sample of children and CHD patients with ICDs. Until such data are available, we should consider the available evidence, which favors programming more ATP sequences for children with cardiomyopathies or CHD. We agree with the comment that those with primary electrical disease are not good candidates for aggressive ATP programming. We too hope that our paper, as well as the points raised in the Letter to the Editor, will help avoid deleterious and painful shocks.
