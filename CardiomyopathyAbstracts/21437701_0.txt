A 50-year-old woman with arterial hypertension suffered from recurrent syncope. On admission, recurrent torsades de pointes tachycardia, ventricular flutter, and ventricular fibrillation with the necessity of cardiopulmonary resuscitation were documented. After administration of β-blocking agents, amiodarone, and magnesium, heart rhythm was stabilized. Coronary angiography excluded coronary artery disease. Echocardiography revealed apical ballooning with reduced ventricular function. The ECG showed left bundle-branch block and profound QT prolongation. A WCD (wearable cardioverter-defibrillator) LifeVest was prescribed for the patient, and, thereafter, no arrhythmias were experienced. The ECG gradually normalized; echocardiography revealed slight anteroapical hypokinesia with overall normal left ventricular function. After a period of 3 months, the patient was no longer asked to wear the LifeVest; 6 months later the patient is without any complaints.
