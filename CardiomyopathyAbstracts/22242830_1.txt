 BACKGROUND AIMS: Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) have been shown to be a promising candidate for tissue regeneration and cancer therapy. However, their therapeutic potential against chemotherapy-induced side-effects remains unclear. METHODS: We treated murine Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) and xenograft human colon tumors with adriamycin (ADM) for 3 consecutive days followed by one intravenous (i.v.) injection of human umbilical cord (hUC) MSC for several cycles. RESULTS: MSC treatment mitigated ADM-induced cardiomyopathy, reduced the extent of ADM-induced apoptosis in intestinal crypts, suppressed body weight loss in mice treated with ADM and increased the survival rate of mice treated with a lethal dose of ADM. The examination of hematologic parameters indicated a moderate recovery in MSC-injected mice. Systemic administration of MSC did not increase the growth of murine LLC cells and human colon carcinoma in vivo while it strongly inhibited the lung metastases of LLC cells. CONCLUSIONS: We evaluated the prophylactic and therapeutic action of hUC MSC on the chemotherapy agent ADM-induced side-effects in two different tumor models. Our observations suggest that MSC can be used as auxiliary means in chemotherapy for certain tumor types.
