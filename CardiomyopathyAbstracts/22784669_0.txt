Central Core Disease (CCD) and Multi-minicore Disease (MmD) (the "core myopathies") have been mainly associated with mutations in the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor (RYR1) and the selenoprotein N (SEPN1) gene. A proportion of cases remain unresolved. Mutations in MYH7 encoding the beta myosin heavy chain protein have been implicated in cardiac and, less frequently, skeletal muscle disorders. Here we report four patients from two families with a histopathological diagnosis of MmD, presenting in childhood with slowly progressive muscle weakness, more proximal in Family 1 and more distal in Family 2, and variable degrees of cardiorespiratory impairment evolving later in life. There was also a strong family history of sudden death in the first family. Muscle biopsies obtained in early childhood showed multiple minicores as the most prominent feature. Sequencing of the MYH7 gene revealed heterozygous missense mutations, c.4399C>G; p.Leu1467Val (exon 32) in Family 1 and c.4763G>C; p.Arg1588Pro (exon 34) in Family 2. These findings suggest MYH7 mutations as another cause of a myopathy with multiple cores, in particular if associated with dominant inheritance and cardiac involvement. However, clinical features previously associated with this genetic background, namely a more distal distribution of weakness and an associated cardiomyopathy, may only evolve over time.
