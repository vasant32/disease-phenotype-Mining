The clinical diagnosis of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is often challenging due to phenotypic variation, reduced/age-related penetrance, and lack of a diagnostic test. A single report has suggested quantitative myocardial immunoanalysis for the desmosomal protein plakoglobin as a diagnostic test with high sensitivity and specificity. We performed immunohistochemistry for plakoglobin and a control protein on myocardial biopsies with fibrofatty replacements from 50 consecutive, unrelated patients. The clinical, genetic, and immunohistochemical data were evaluated by independent observers in a blinded manner. The immunohistochemical and clinical diagnoses were compared and the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values calculated. Our analysis showed 37 samples (74%) with a reduced immunosignal for plakoglobin. Of the 34 patients with a clinical diagnosis of ARVC, 29 displayed a reduced plakoglobin signal. Of the 14 patients with a clinical diagnosis other than ARVC, 6 displayed a reduced signal. Two patients were excluded from further analysis. A sensitivity of 85%, a specificity of 57%, a positive predictive value of 83%, and a negative predictive value of 62% were found. In conclusion, immunohistochemical analysis for plakoglobin, applied as a diagnostic test for ARVC, seems associated with a relatively high sensitivity, but limited specificity, and although additional validation is required, we advocate caution in basing clinical decision-making on the proposed diagnostic test.
