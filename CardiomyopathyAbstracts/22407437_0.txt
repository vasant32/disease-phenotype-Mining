 BACKGROUND: We and others have shown previously that left ventricular (LV) contractile reserve assessed quantitatively by high-dose dobutamine stress-echocardiography (DSE) has prognostic implications in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. PURPOSE: To assess the feasibility of semi-quantitative assessment of LV contractile reserve by differently skilled operators in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. METHODS: High-dose DSE was performed in 63 consecutive patients, mean age 50 ± 10 years and ejection fraction (EF) 19 ± 8%. LVEF was calculated 1) using Simpson's biplane formula, and 2) semi-quantitatively (5% increments) by novice and experienced echocardiographers, and by a DSE expert. Patients were considered to have preserved LV contractile reserve if LVEF dobutamine-induced change was ≥5%. RESULTS: Twenty-seven (45.8%) patients died during the 5-year follow-up. The feasibility of the assessment was 89%, 94%, and 98% for novice and experienced readers and DSE expert, respectively. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that LV contractile reserve assessed semi-quantitatively by DSE expert and experienced reader achieved the best prognostic separation (log rank 19.63 and 18.99, respectively, p < 0.001 for both), followed by quantitative assessment (log rank 9.76, p = 0.0018) and assessment by novice reader (log rank 8.76, p = 0.012). Areas under the curves were similar for quantitative and semi-quantitative assessment of LV contractile reserve. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that semi-quantitative assessment of LV contractile reserve is feasible by differently skilled operators.
