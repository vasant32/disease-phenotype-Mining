ARVC 2012.â€‚The most common presentation of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is palpitations or ventricular tachycardia (VT) of left bundle branch morphology in a young or middle-aged individual. The 12-lead electrocardiogram may be normal or have T-wave inversion beyond V(1) in an otherwise healthy person who is suspected of having ARVC. The most frequent imaging abnormalities are an enlarged right ventricle, decrease in right ventricular (RV) function, and localized wall motion abnormalities. Risk factors for implantable cardioverter defibrillator include a history of aborted sudden death, syncope, young age, decreased left ventricular function, and marked decrease in RV function. Recent results of treatment with epicardial ablation are encouraging. (J Cardiovasc Electrophysiol, Vol. pp. 1-5).
