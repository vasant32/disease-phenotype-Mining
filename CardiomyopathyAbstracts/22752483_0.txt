Friedreich ataxia is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder caused by mutations in the FXN gene that result in abnormally low levels of the mitochondrial protein frataxin. The authors recently used a lateral flow immunoassay to measure frataxin levels in a large cohort of controls, carriers, and patients with the condition. The findings show that frataxin levels do not appreciably change over time and correlate well with GAA(1) repeat length and age of onset; thus, frataxin is a reliable and stable marker for severity of disease. In this article, the authors present a patient diagnosed as having Friedreich ataxia and osteosarcoma who received combined methotrexate, doxorubicin (Adriamycin), and cisplatin (MAP) chemotherapy over 8 months. The authors assessed the effect of treatment on frataxin levels, blood cell counts, and clinical markers of cardiomyopathy. Results of the regimen and the use of MAP chemotherapy for treatment of neoplasms in individuals with Friedreich ataxia are discussed.
