Pheochromocytoma is a rare, catecholamine-secreting tumor of neuroendocrine cells. It has  been documented to present atypically as myocardial ischemia, arrhythmias, or congestive  heart failure. We present the case of a patient who had transient cardiomyopathy with hypokinesia  of the basal portions of the left ventricle and hyperkinesia of the apex triggered by  a pheochromocytoma crisis similar to that of tako-tsubo cardiomyopathy, but with an inverse  left ventricular contractile pattern ('inverted tako-tsubo').
