Natriuretic peptide family consists of several hormones produced by cardiomyocyte, including atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP). They possess similar gene structures and protective effects of cardiovascular physiology, such as anti-hypertrophy, anti-fibrosis, myocardial relaxation and blood pressure regulation. The corresponding natriuretic peptide receptor A, B and C mediate multiple effects of natriuretic peptides to maintain cardiovascular homeostasis. Specially, natriuretic peptide receptor-A preferentially binds ANP and BNP, while natriuretic peptide receptor-B is more selective for C-type natriuretic peptides. Natriuretic peptide receptor-C(NPR-C), binding all kinds of natriuretic peptides, clears natriuretic peptides from the circulation through receptor-mediated internalization and degradation. BNP levels were reported to be a good predictor of left ventricular dysfunction and decompensated heart failure from a clinical standpoint. BNP infusion is an effective treatment for acute heart failure. Investigations on natriuretic peptides' single nucleotide polymorphisms and biological function suggested that they could be associated with several cardiovascular diseases, such as atrial fibrillation, cardiomyopathy, heart failure and so on. Transgenic mice with natriuretic peptides and their receptors gene deletion display myocardial hypertrophy and fibrosis, which are associated with the development of hypertension, cardiomyopathy and heart failure. Certain stimuli triggering cardiac hypertrophy and ischemic injuries may be involved in regulating gene expression of natriuretic peptides and their receptors. Therefore, advances in understanding of natriuretic peptide family genes and their regulatory mechanisms will lead to greater insight into the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases and blaze a new trail in clinical treatment.
