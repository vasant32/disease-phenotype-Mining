We report the first documented case of HeartMate IIÂ® left ventricular assist device (LVAD) reimplantation following Cohn Teflon felt plug repair of the initial left ventricular apical cannulation site. This case highlights the current limitations of the predictability of myocardial recovery while describing an effective technique for possible future LVAD reimplantation.
