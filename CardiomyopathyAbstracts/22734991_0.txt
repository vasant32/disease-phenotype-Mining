We report the case management of a patient with a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus intramyocardial abscess adjacent to a previously grafted native right coronary artery. The diagnosis was eventually established by obtaining a gallium scan. This case illustrates the need for maintaining a wide-ranging view of potential causes of bacteremia after cardiac surgery, especially in elderly patients with multiple comorbidities.
