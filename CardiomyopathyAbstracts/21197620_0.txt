Recent clinical trials carried out in patients with advanced cancer have shown that recombinant TRAIL administration is usually safe and well tolerated when used either alone or in association with chemotherapeutic drugs. Notably, anticancer chemotherapy can be associated to cardiomiopathy. We have here demonstrated that TRAIL (administrated as either recombinant soluble TRAIL or as AAV-TRAIL expression viral vector) reduced the development of cardiomyopathy in the ApoE(-/-) diabetic mouse model. These data suggest, for the first time, that therapeutically administration of TRAIL might have a cardioprotective effect.
