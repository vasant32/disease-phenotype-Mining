Recent studies have suggested that RTN4 is a multifunctional gene, including inhibition of axonal regeneration, vascular remodeling, apoptosis, and tumor suppression. The TATC and CAA insertion/deletion polymorphisms of RTN4 3'-UTR have been linked to schizophrenia, depression, and dilated cardiomyopathy. To test whether these two polymorphisms are associated with cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC), in this research, by using polymerase chain reaction-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, we determined the genotypes of the TATC and CAA polymorphisms in 336 CSCC patients and 450 unrelated control subjects. Allele frequencies of TATC and CAA polymorphisms were not significantly different between CSCC patients and control subjects (odds ratio [OR]=1.22, 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.98-1.50 for TATC; OR=0.95, 95% CI=0.76-1.18 for CAA). Decreased CSCC risk was associated with TATC polymorphism in a recessive model (OR=0.49, 95% CI=0.30-0.77), while no significant association was observed between CAA polymorphism and CSCC in different genetic models. Results of stratified analysis revealed that both TATC and CAA polymorphisms were associated with high clinical stage, and CAA polymorphism was also associated with positive parametrial invasion (OR=0.69, 95% CI=0.48-0.98). The present study provides evidence that TATC and CAA insertion/deletion polymorphisms are associated with CSCC, indicating that genetic variation in RTN4 3'-UTR contributes to the susceptibility to CSCC. It is necessary to confirm these findings in ethnically different populations and with a larger sample.
