 BACKGROUND: Left heart mechanical circulatory support (MCS) through the left chest via the pulmonary vein and descending thoracic aorta is a good option for patients with an inaccessible anterior mediastinum and/or poor peripheral access. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We report the case of a 19-year-old small female with a newly discovered bulky primary mediastinal diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (PMBL) who developed refractory inverted Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TC) with cardiogenic shock. RESULTS: Temporary MCS was implemented in order to stabilize the patient and proceed with a chemotherapy treatment. Given the patient's oncologic "frozen" mediastinum and the presence of poor peripheral arterial access, the left heart temporary MCS was successfully implanted through a left mini-thoracotomy via the left inferior pulmonary vein and descending thoracic aorta. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of temporary MCS to treat inverted TC and diffuse PMBL.
