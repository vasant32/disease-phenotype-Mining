There are a large number of patients with functional mitral regurgitation resulting from dilated cardiomyopathy. The decision between surgical correction and medical management of severe mitral regurgitation in heart failure can be difficult. The data regarding long-term benefits and mortality after surgical intervention are contradictory. Recent data suggest that mitral regurgitation can be surgically corrected in heart failure with symptomatic improvements and beneficial reverse remodeling. Contrary to prior beliefs, mitral valve repair can be performed safely with minimal postoperative mortality. Data from multi-institutional, randomized prospective trials will help to elucidate many of the questions and concerns regarding repair of severe functional mitral regurgitation.
