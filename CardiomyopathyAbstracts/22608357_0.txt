Adaptive servo ventilation (ASV) is reported to be effective for the treatment of heart failure. We treated a patient with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy using ASV and assessed the effects on hemodynamics, coronary flow, and flow reserve before and after ASV therapy. This case suggests that ASV might decrease myocardial oxygen demand, which was represented by the decreased resting coronary flow velocity (the improvement of coronary flow velocity reserve) on ASV.
