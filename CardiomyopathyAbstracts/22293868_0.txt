For over 50 years, viral infection has been recognized as an important trigger of acute myocarditis, inflammatory dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and congestive heart failure. Nevertheless, viral heart disease remains challenging to diagnose and treat. Improved diagnostic methods for myocarditis have led to a better understanding of its pathophysiology. The recognition of virus-mediated damage, inflammation and autoimmune dysregulation in these patients highlights the importance of differentiating between virus-positive and virus-negative inflammatory DCM. These insights have led to the development of novel treatment strategies, including intravenous immunoglobulin and interferon therapy for virus-positive patients. This article will focus on the pathogenesis of viral myocarditis, especially parvovirus B19-induced, its progression to inflammatory DCM and future treatment strategies.
