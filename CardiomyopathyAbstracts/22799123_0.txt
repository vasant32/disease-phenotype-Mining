Endomyocardial fibrosis is a variety of restrictive cardiomyopathy, in which endocardium of one or both ventricles is thickened markedly with involvement of underlying myocardium. Partial obliteration of ventricular cavities by fibrous tissue and thrombus causes diastolic dysfunction with increased resistance to ventricular filling. Systolic function is well preserved till late stages. Biventricular or isolated left ventricular involvement is common. Isolated right ventricular involvement is relatively uncommon. Case reports on endomyocardial fibrosis have declined in literature. In India, endomyocardial fibrosis is mainly reported from Kerala. A case of right ventricular endomyocardial fibrosis from West Bengal is reported here. Isolated right sided endomyocardial fibrosis, massive right atrial enlargement, complete disorganization of tricuspid valve, massive pericardial effusion, normal absolute eosinophil count and its sporadic occurrence outside 15 degrees of the equatorial belt were interesting features in this case of endomyocardial fibrosis. X-ray features were typical of pericardial effusion masking underlying endomyocardial fibrosis. Endomyocardial fibrosis is a neglected research field. It needs more attention from biomedical researchers.
