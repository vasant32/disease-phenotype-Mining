Results of long term clinic-electrophysiological follow-up of a large group of children with Wolf-Parkinson-White (WPW) phenomenon are present. From 1993 to 2011 we examined 176 children - 117 boys (66,5%) and 59 girls (33,5%) - with manifesting type of WPW. Age at first examination was 12.5+/-3.2 ( 0.1 18 ). In 66.5% of children WPW phenomenon was present in the age from 10 to 18 . Hundred fifty nine children (104 [65.4%] boys and 55 [34.6%] girls) were followed up for 0.5-17 years (mean 7.4+/-4.5 years). During follow-up spontaneous attacs of atrioventricular reciprocal tachycardia appeared in 13 children (8.2%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 4.4-13.6%). Spontaneous disappearance of signs of ventricular pre-excitation on electrocardiogram and transition to intermittent form of WPW were registered in 14(8.8%, 95%CI 4.9-14.3%) and 12 children (7.5%, 95% CI 3.9-12.8%). Short lasting syncopal states were observed in 15 children (8.4%). In 3 of them atrial fibrillation with high rate of venricular rhytm was induced during transesophageal electrophysiological study. Two (1.3%) children had history of clinical death. In one of them WPW phenomenon was combined with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. This child died at the age of 11 years. One (0.6%) boy with WPW phenomenon died suddenly in 3 years after initial examination. Thus, children with WPW phenomenon are at risk of development of life threatening states and sudden cardiac death. Stratification of risk of sudden death is necessary at examination of such children.
