Intra-Atrial Conduction Block. A 42-year-old woman with a history of cardiomyopathy and multiple ablation procedures for atrial tachycardia developed intra-atrial conduction block that mimicked atrioventricular (AV) nodal block during radiofrequency ablation at the cavotricuspid isthmus. She was treated with atrial pacing (from the coronary sinus), which overcame intra-atrial conduction block and resulted in AV nodal conduction. (J Cardiovasc Electrophysiol, Vol. pp. 1-4).
