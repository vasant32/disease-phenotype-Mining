We assessed the clinical echocardiograhic, hematological, and biochemical parameters in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCMP) and control individuals mainly focusing on the mean platelet volume (MPV) in terms of DCMP and left ventricle (LV) thrombus formation. Consecutive patients (n = 251) with DCMP and 266 patients without DCMP were studied. Mean platelet volume was significantly greater in patients with DCMP than in control patients (P < .05 for all comparisons). Comparing DCMP patients with LV thrombus (19 patients, 8%) and without LV thrombus (232 patients, 92%) showed that the prevalence of smokers was significantly higher and ejection fraction was significantly lower in patients with LV thrombus. We have shown that patients with DCMP have significantly higher MPV suggesting more platelet activation and the MPV of patients with DCMP and LV thrombus is comparable to those of patients without LV thrombus.
