Sodium-dependent glucose cotransporters (SGLT1 and SGLT2), which have a key role in the absorption of glucose in the kidney and/or gastrointestinal tract, have been proposed as a novel therapeutic strategy for diabetes and cardiomyopathy. Here we developed a simple cell-based, nonradioactive method for functional screening of SGLT1 and SGLT2 inhibitors. Stable cell lines expressing human SGLT1 and SGLT2 were established by transfecting HEK293 cells with vectors (pCMV6-Neo) having full-length human SGLT1 and SGLT2 and selecting the positive clones following neomycin treatment. We confirmed the gene expression of SGLT1 and SGLT2 by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunoblotting. Furthermore, to analyze the function of SGLTs, we incubated stable cell lines with 2-deoxyglucose or fluorescent d-glucose analog (2-NBDG) and performed glucose uptake assay. A significant (P<0.001) increase in glucose uptake was observed in both cell lines. The increased glucose uptake in both cell lines was completely inhibited when treated with nonspecific SGLT1/SGLT2 inhibitors and phlorizin (100μM), but not when treated with nonspecific sodium-independent facilitative glucose transporter (GLUT) inhibitors (100μM). Taken together, our data suggest that cell-based methods developed for screening SGLT1/SGLT2 inhibitors are phlorizin sensitive and specific for respective glucose transporters. This assay provides a simple and rapid method for identifying novel and selective SGLT inhibitors.
