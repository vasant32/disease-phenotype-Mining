We present the case of a 48 year-old male with a history of cystic fibrosis who presented with massive haemoptysis and was later found to have Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. He subsequently developed a left ventricular (LV) thrombus which was successfully removed via a left apical ventriculotomy. Surgical management of LV thrombus related to Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is warranted in a selected population of patients and a left apical ventriculotomy provides good access with minimal complications in the post operative setting.
