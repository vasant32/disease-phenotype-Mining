AIMS: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a risk factor for left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and heart failure. We evaluated the effect of CKD on left ventricular (LV) remodelling among patients with mild heart failure. METHODS AND RESULTS: REVERSE was a randomized, controlled trial evaluating cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) in patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class I/II heart failure. CKD was defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <60 mL/min/1.73 m(2). We compared changes in LV function and size over the course of 12 months by CKD status using linear mixed models adjusted for demographics, co-morbidities, medications, cardiomyopathy aetiology, and CRT status. Finally, we evaluated the effect of CKD on cardiac remodelling among patients randomized to CRT on or off. CKD was associated with worsening LV function and dilation compared with the non-CKD group {adjusted, 12-month Î² coefficients for the CKD group compared with the non-CKD referent group: LV ejection fraction (%) [-1.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) -3.36 to -0.24], LV end-systolic volume (mL) (14.16, 95% CI 3.96-24.36), LV end-diastolic volume (mL) (14.88, 95% CI 2.88-26.76), LV end-systolic diameter (cm) (0.36, 95% CI 0.12-0.48), LV end-diastolic diameter (cm) (0.24, 95% CI 0.012-0.36), mitral regurgitation (%) (3.12, 95% CI 0.48-5.76), and LV shape (0.036, 95% CI 0.012-0.060)}. In participants assigned to CRT, those without CKD had significantly greater improvements in LV structural parameters compared with the CKD group. CONCLUSIONS: In comparison with participants with normal kidney function, CKD is an independent risk factor for ventricular dysfunction and dilation. CRT improves LV function and structure to a lesser extent in patients with CKD than in those with normal kidney function.
