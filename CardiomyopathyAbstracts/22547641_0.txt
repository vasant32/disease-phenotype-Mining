Postoperative ventricular septal defect (post-op VSD) after septal myectomy in patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy is a rare and unexpected complication. We report a case of successful percutaneous closure of VSD following septal myectomy and mitral valve replacement in a patient with intrinsic mitral valve disease and severe mitral valve regurgitation together with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy.
