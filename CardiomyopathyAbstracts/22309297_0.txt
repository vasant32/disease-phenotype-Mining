We report a case of postpartum severe mitral regurgitation caused by papillary muscle rupture in a female with normal coronary arteries. The etiology of papillary muscle rupture was endocarditis from puerperal fever. Clinical stabilization was achieved with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) followed by mitral valve replacement two days later.
