Shock patients with restrictive cardiomyopathy due to cardiac amyloidosis are refractory to medical treatment. Here, we report a case of early initiation of intra-aortic balloon pumping (IABP) in a patient with cardiac amyloidosis who developed postoperative shock. Continuous hemodiafiltration was also applied to control circulating fluid volume. The mechanical treatments allowed reduction of the doses of catecholamine and diuretics and resulted in full recovery. It is reasonable to initiate IABP and hemofiltration dialysis during the early stages for the appropriate control of hemodynamics and fluid in shock patients with cardiac amyloidosis.
