Pacemakers devaluate the accuracy of the electrocardiogram (ECG) for the diagnosis of myocardial ischaemia. We present the case of a 53-year-old man with ischaemic cardiomyopathy and acute chest pain. Besides biventricular pacing, new ST-segment elevations were present leading to the diagnosis of myocardial infarction. However, no ECG criteria for the diagnosis of myocardial ischaemia in biventricular-paced rhythm are available.
