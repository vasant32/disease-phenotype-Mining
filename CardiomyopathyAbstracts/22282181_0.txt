Recent technologic advances in cardiac magnetic resonance (MR) imaging have resulted in images with high spatial and temporal resolution and excellent myocardial tissue characterization. Cardiac MR is a valuable imaging technique for detection and assessment of the morphology and functional characteristics of the nonischemic cardiomyopathy. It has gained acceptance as a standalone imaging modality that can provide further information beyond the capabilities of traditional modalities such as echocardiography and angiography. Black-blood fast spin-echo MR images allow morphologic assessment of the heart with high spatial resolution, while T2-weighted MR images can depict acute myocardial edema. Contrast material-enhanced images can depict and be used to quantify myocardial edema, infiltration, and fibrosis. This review presents recommended cardiac MR protocols for and the spectrum of imaging appearances of the nonischemic cardiomyopathies.
