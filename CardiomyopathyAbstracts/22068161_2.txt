 AIMS: Mutations in A-type nuclear lamins gene, LMNA, lead to a dilated cardiomyopathy. We have reported abnormal activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2 (ERK1/2) signalling in hearts from Lmna(H222P/H222P) mice, which develop dilated cardiomyopathy. We therefore determined whether an inhibitor of ERK1/2 signalling that has been investigated in clinical trials for cancer has the potential to be translated to humans with LMNA cardiomyopathy. METHODS AND RESULTS: To evaluate the relevance of this finding in mice to patients, we analysed the ERK1/2 signalling in heart tissue from human subjects with LMNA cardiomyopathy and showed that it was abnormally activated. To determine whether pharmacological inhibitors of the ERK1/2 signalling pathway could potentially be used to treat LMNA cardiomyopathy, we administered selumetinib to male Lmna(H222P/H222P) mice starting at 16 weeks of age, after they show signs of cardiac deterioration, up to 20 weeks of age. Selumetinib is an inhibitor of ERK1/2 signalling and has been given safely to human subjects in clinical trials for cancer. Systemic treatment with selumetinib inhibited cardiac ERK1/2 phosphorylation and blocked increased expression of RNAs encoding natriuretic peptide precursors and proteins involved in sarcomere architecture that occurred in placebo-treated mice. Echocardiography and histological analysis demonstrated that treatment increases cardiac fractional shortening, prevents myocardial fibrosis, and prolongs survival. Selumetinib treatment did not induce biochemical abnormalities suggestive of renal or hepatic toxicity. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that selumetinib or other related inhibitors that have been safely administered to humans in clinical trials could potentially be used to treat LMNA cardiomyopathy.
