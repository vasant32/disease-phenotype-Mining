 OBJECTIVES: Aliskiren is the first in a new class of orally active direct renin inhibitors, approved for the treatment of hypertension. However, the efficacy of aliskiren in diabetic cardiovascular complications remains to be defined. This study aimed to test the hypothesis that aliskiren may enhance the beneficial effects of pioglitazone against cardiovascular injury associated with diabetic nephropathy. METHODS: Diabetic nephropathy was induced in rats by unilateral nephrectomy followed by streptozotocin injection. Diabetic nephropathic rats were orally given vehicle, pioglitazone, aliskiren, or combined pioglitazone and aliskiren for four weeks to compare their effects on cardiovascular injury, particularly myocardial fibrosis. KEY FINDINGS: Pioglitazone treatment significantly attenuated cardiac lipid peroxidation, oxidative injury and myocardial fibrosis in diabetic nephropathic rats. This was associated with up-regulation of transforming growth factor-Î²1 and matrix metalloproteinase-2 genes, along with down-regulation of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 gene in cardiac tissue. The combination of aliskiren with pioglitazone exerted greater beneficial effect than monotherapy with either drug, on all the aforementioned parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggested that aliskiren enhanced the protective effects of pioglitazone against myocardial fibrosis, in experimental diabetic nephropathy. Thus, the combination of aliskiren and pioglitazone may be a potential therapeutic strategy for cardiovascular injury associated with diabetic nephropathy.
