Purpose: We aimed to analyze the feasibility of two-dimensional speckle-tracking echocardiography (2DSTE) in evaluating myocardial strain in consecutive, nonselected patients in daily clinical practice. Methods: Strain analysis using 2DSTE was attempted in 59 consecutive patients: 24 patients with severe aortic stenosis, 28 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, and 7 healthy controls. The analysis was done by four expert echocardiographers and one cardiology resident. Results: It was possible to obtain reliable data for radial strain in 175 of 354 segments (49%), circumferential strain in 192 of 354 segments (54%), and longitudinal strain in 319 of 354 segments (90%). Experienced echocardiographers felt assessment of radial and circumferential strain was appropriate in more segments than did the cardiology resident (57% and 58% vs. 23% and 40%, respectively, P < 0.01). Conclusion: Longitudinal strain analysis with 2DSTE is feasible in most segments, but the radial and circumferential strain evaluation was only feasible in approximately half of the patients.
