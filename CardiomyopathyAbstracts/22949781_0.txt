A 76-year-old man was admitted to our institution for elective exchange of his implanted cardioverter-defibrillator generator. Nine years earlier, he had been diagnosed with nonischemic cardiomyopathy and nonsustainable ventricular tachycardia. At that time, he had received a single-chamber implanted cardioverter-defibrillator, which was upgraded to a dual-chamber implanted cardioverter-defibrillator 3 years later. In the course of the current admission, routine device interrogation during exchange of the patient's implanted cardioverter-defibrillator generator revealed 150 episodes of ventricular tachycardia in the preceding 7 months, 137 of which had been successfully treated by antitachycardia pacing therapy without shock. These findings show the remarkable effectiveness of antitachycar-dia pacing in terminating ventricular tachycardia while preventing the delivery of shocks, minimizing patient discomfort, and avoiding implanted cardioverter-defibrillator battery depletion.
