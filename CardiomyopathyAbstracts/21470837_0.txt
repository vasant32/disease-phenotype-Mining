 BACKGROUND AND AIM: A decoy receptor for advanced glycation end product (soluble RAGE or sRAGE) is involved in left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), and cardiomyopathy myocardial damage in experimental models and observational studies in patients with heart failure support the hypothesis that sRAGE attenuates the progression of heart disease and prevents death. Since sRAGE accumulates in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) we studied the relationship between plasma sRAGE with LVH in CKD patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: We enrolled 142 patients with an average estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 32 ml/min/1.73 m(2) and 49 healthy control individuals matched for age and gender. Plasma sRAGE was significantly higher in CKD patients than in healthy controls. Significant inverse relationships were found between sRAGE with left ventricular mass index (LVMI) and mean wall thickness (MWT) but no such associations were found in controls. A bootstrap re-sampling validation study confirmed the estimates of the link between sRAGE and these variables. On covariance analysis, the slopes of LVMI and MWT to sRAGE were significantly steeper in CKD patients than in the controls. On logistic regression analysis 1 log unit increase in sRAGE was associated with a 82% decrease in the odds for LVH in CKD patients. CONCLUSIONS: sRAGE is an inverse marker of LVH in CKD patients. This association generates the hypothesis that the RAGE pathway could be a causal risk factor for LVH in this population and that blockade of this pathway by the endogenous decoy receptor sRAGE could attenuate LVH in the same population.
