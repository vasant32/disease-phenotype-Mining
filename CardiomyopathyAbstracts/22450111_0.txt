We report transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) for pure aortic valve insufficiency in a patient with an otherwise normal aortic valve and a long-term left ventricular assist device (LVAD). An oversized 29-mm Edwards SAPIEN valve (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA) was implanted in the 21-mm native aortic valve annulus. Despite the complete absence of aortic calcifications, the prosthesis remained stably anchored inside the annulus. The reported experience demonstrates that TAVI is feasible even in patients with pure aortic valve regurgitation and can be a reasonable option in patients with aortic regurgitation after LVAD implantation.
