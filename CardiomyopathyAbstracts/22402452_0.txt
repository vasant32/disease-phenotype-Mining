OBJECTIVES: Unresponsive pulmonary hypertension (PH) may contraindicate heart transplant since it implies poor early outcomes. The present study reports the effectiveness of oral perioperative sildenafil in allowing heart transplant candidacy and surgery in a selected group of patients initially deemed ineligible because of PH. METHODS: Between May 2005 and December 2009, 31 consecutive patients (5 females, 9 with a history of idiopatic cardiomyopathy and 16 with a history of coronary artery disease, 10 with previous sternotomies, 71.42 ± 27.69 ml/min/m(2) mean pre-operative epidermal growth factor receptor) were qualified for oral sildenafil because of unresponsive PH at baseline right heart catheterization (RHC). After a 12-week trial, RHC disclosed PH reversibility (mean pulmonary vascular resistance index: 9.57 ± 4.07 WU, mean transpulmonary gradient 14.47 ± 5.66 mmHg and mean systolic pulmonary artery pressure: 68.96 ± 15.15 mmHg), allowing listing despite a higher risk for early post-transplant RV failure. Transplant protocol included donor/recipient size matching ≥0.8 and inhaled nitric oxide in the early post-operative period followed by reinstitution of oral sildenafil. RESULTS: All patients underwent heart transplantation. Mean overall graft ischaemic time was 179 ± 47min; mean donor recipient weight ratio was 1.04 ± 0.17. Right ventricular failure developed in three patients (9.6%) and hospital mortality was 3.2%. Protocol RHC disclosed pulmonary haemodynamic profile normalization within the third post-operative month allowing weaning from sildenafil in the 30 hospital survivors. One-year RHC confirmed PH reversal (n = 29 patients, all who survived up to 1year). CONCLUSIONS: This pilot prospective uncontrolled trial suggests that oral sildenafil is effective in allowing candidacy, safe transplantation and post-operative pulmonary profile normalization in potential recipients initially disqualified because of PH.
