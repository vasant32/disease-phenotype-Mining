Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, also known as transient left ventricular apical ballooning syndrome, stress-induced cardiomyopathy and broken heart syndrome, is characterized by transient left ventricular dysfunction in the absence of obstructive coronary artery disease. It was first described in 1990 in Japan, and gained worldwide recognition following the publication of several series of case reports. Its prevalence is estimated to be 1.7-2.2% of suspected acute coronary syndromes. Although takotsubo cardiomyopathy has been progressively better characterized, certain aspects remain to be clarified, and it is still under study. In this article, we report a series of ten cases of takotsubo cardiomyopathy admitted to a cardiology department, and compare the clinical, laboratory, electrocardiographic and imaging characteristics, therapeutic regimens and follow-up of these patients with those described in the latest scientific reviews.
