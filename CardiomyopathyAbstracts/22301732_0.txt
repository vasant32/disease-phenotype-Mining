Noncompaction of the ventricular myocardium (NVM) is a rare cardiac anomaly which can lead to the development of cardiomyopathy. NVM can be isolated or associated with congenital heart anomalies such as ventricular septal defect, atrial septal defect, pulmonic stenosis, bicuspid aortic valve, and Ebstein anomaly. NVM usually presents with heart failure symptoms, ventricular tachyarrhythmias, and thromboembolic events. We report two cases of NVM, one associated with a ventricular septal defect and other associated with bicuspid aortic valve.
