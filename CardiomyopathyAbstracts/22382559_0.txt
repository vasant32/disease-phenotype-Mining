Peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) is a cardiomyopathy of unknown cause that occurs in the peripartum period. We report a case of PPCM presenting with syncope 1 month after an uncomplicated delivery. Electrocardiography showed Torsades de pointes (TdP) and QT interval prolongation. Echocardiography showed left ventricular systolic dysfunction and endomyocardial biopsy showed myocyte degeneration and fibrosis. Administration of magnesium sulfate and temporary pacing eliminated recurrent TdP. Genetic analyses revealed that recurrent TdP occurred via electrolyte disturbance and cardiac failure due to PPCM on the basis of a novel mutation in KCNH2, a gene responsible for inherited type 2 long QT syndrome.
