Sarin, a lethal chemical nerve agent, may be a causative factor in multifactorial syndrome implicated in the Gulf War and Tokyo terrorist attacks. Although a high dose results in seizure and death, low-dose exposure may lead to autonomic imbalance and chronic cardiac pathologies. In this study, echocardiography and electrocardiography were used to examine the late-onset effects of a low-dose sarin on cardiac structure and function in mice. Adrenal corticosterone and tyrosine hydroxylase mRNA levels were measured. Stress responsiveness of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis was also tested. Findings demonstrate changes consistent with a dilated cardiomyopathy, including left ventricular dilatation, reduced contractility, and altered electrophysiological and inotropic responses to Î²-adrenergic stimulation. Results also indicate reduced adrenal tyrosine hydroxylase mRNA, corticosterone and altered stress responsiveness of HPA indicating autonomic imbalance. The role of low-dose sarin/organophosphate exposure needs to be considered in the military and civilian populations that suffer from autonomic imbalance and/or cardiomyopathies of indeterminate origin.
