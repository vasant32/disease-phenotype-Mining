Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most common inherited cardiac disorder. This autosomal dominant condition is defined by left ventricular hypertrophy and associated with functional limitation and premature death. In fact, many individuals are asymptomatic and the annual mortality in most modern series is 1% or less. However, severe symptoms may develop at any age, and the risk of premature death from arrhythmia, stroke, and progressive systolic impairment may complicate asymptomatic disease. The clinical management of patients with HCM therefore encompasses (1) genetic counseling including discussion of indications for genetic testing and cascade family screening, (2) assessment of prognostic risk from ventricular arrhythmia, stroke, and heart failure, and (3) symptom management. This article describes the interventional treatments in the management of severe symptoms associated with left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO).
