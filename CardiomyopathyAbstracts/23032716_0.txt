PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this review is to examine the appropriateness of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) for the patient with ischemic cardiomyopathy and congestive heart failure. RECENT FINDINGS: CABG is the gold standard therapy for patients with advanced multivessel and left main coronary artery disease. A critical analysis of the Surgical Treatment of Ischemic Heart Failure (STICH) trial confirms the benefit of CABG for patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy. SUMMARY: CABG can be safely applied to patients with heart failure and provides benefit for appropriately selected patients.
