 UNLABELLED: ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Left ventricular non-compaction (LVNC) is a recently recognized rare disorder. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may help to clarify the uncertainties related to this genetic cardiomyopathy. Despite the fact that many articles have been published concerning the use of MRI in the study of LVNC, there is a lack of data describing the disease in the North African population. The aim of our study is to clarify MRI findings of LVNC in North African patients. METHODS: In our retrospective cohort, twelve patients (7 male, mean age 53 Â± 8 years) underwent MRI for suspected LVNC. Correlations were investigated between the number of non-compacted segments per patient and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), then between the number of non-compacted segments and left ventricular end diastolic diameter. The presence or absence of late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) was qualitatively determined for each left ventricular myocardial segment. RESULTS: Non-compaction was more commonly observed at the apex, the anterior and the lateral walls, especially on their apical and mid-cavity segments. 83% of patients had impaired LVEF. There was no correlation between the number of non-compacted segments per patient and LVEF (r = -0.361; p = 0.263), nor between the number of non-compacted segments per patient and left ventricular end diastolic diameter (r = 0.280; p = 0.377). LGE was observed in 22 left ventricular segments. No association was found between the pattern of fibrosis and non-compaction distribution (OR = 2.2, CI [0.91-5.55], p = 0.076). CONCLUSION: The distribution of LVNC in North African patients does not differ from other populations. Ventricular dysfunction is independent from the number of non-compacted segments. Myocardial fibrosis is not limited to non-compacted areas but can extend to compacted segments.
