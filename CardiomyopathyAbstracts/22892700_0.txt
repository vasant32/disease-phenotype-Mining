The evaluation of the defibrillation threshold (DFT) during the implantation of a cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) is an important stage of the procedure, as a high DFT can be found in up to 16% of patients. We report a patient with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) submitted to a biventricular ICD implantation. During the procedure, the patient showed a high DFT and showed to be resistant to usual therapeutic modalities. We opted for the azygos vein defibrillation lead implantation, with good resolution.
