Sarcoidosis is a granulomatous disease that may involve multiple organ systems. The prognosis of sarcoidosis is influenced by the presence and severity of cardiac lesions. Thinning of the wall in the ventricular septum has often been reported, whereas an interventricular septal mass is rare. We describe a case of cardiac sarcoidosis resulting in a myocardial mass in the basal portion of the interventricular septum that was sensitive to corticosteroid treatment.
