It has become evident that protein degradation by proteolytic enzymes, known as proteases, is partly responsible for cardiovascular dysfunction in various types of heart disease. Both extracellular and intracellular alterations in proteolytic activities are invariably seen in heart failure associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy, hypertensive cardiomyopathy, diabetic cardiomyopathy, and ischemic cardiomyopathy. Genetic cardiomyopathy displayed in different strains of hamsters provides a useful model for studying heart failure due to either cardiac hypertrophy or cardiac dilation. Alterations in the function of several myocardial organelles such as sarcolemma, sarcoplasmic reticulum, myofibrils, mitochondria, as well as extracellular matrix have been shown to be due to subcellular remodeling as a consequence of changes in gene expression and protein content in failing hearts from cardiomyopathic hamsters. In view of the increased activities of various proteases, including calpains and matrix metalloproteinases in the hearts of genetically determined hamsters, it is proposed that the activation of different proteases may also represent an important determinant of subcellular remodeling and cardiac dysfunction associated with genetic cardiomyopathy.
