We present a review of our experience and pregnancy outcome in patients with GSD III managed by our centre. Between 1997 and 2010 there were 15 pregnancies in seven women with GSD III. Four women had GSD IIIb (nine pregnancies) and three GSD IIIa (six pregnancies). There was a successful outcome in all 15 pregnancies with delivery of 15 liveborn infants. Four infants were of low birthweight (<2nd centile) but all have developed normally apart from one with behavioural/psychiatric problems. Three women had pre-existing cardiomyopathy prior to pregnancy. One of these women had deterioration of her cardiomyopathy during pregnancy and again in the post-partum period. Women with GSD III do not seem to have any issues with fertility. Overall the outcome of pregnancy for both mother and child is good. Care needs to be taken to avoid maternal hypoglycemia which may be associated with intrauterine growth restriction and low birth weight. Cardiac function should be monitored carefully particularly in those with pre-existing cardiomyopathy.
