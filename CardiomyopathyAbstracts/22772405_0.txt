 OBJECTIVE: To assess left and right ventricular systolic function in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) using real-time three-dimensional echocardiography (RT-3DE). METHODS: Fifty DCM patients and 50 normal subjects were enrolled. Left and right ventricular systolic function parameters including end-systolic volume (ESV) and end-diastolic volume (EDV), stroke volume (SV) and ejection fraction (EF) were measured with RT-3DE. The systolicdyssynchrony index (SDI) for left ventricular systolic function was also measured in the same time. The study compared the data of the left and right ventricular systolic function parameters between the DCM group and the control group. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMRI) was performed in a subgroup of the 30 DCM patients to confirm RT-3DE measurements. RESULTS: The results of EDV, ESV and SDI measured by RT-3DE were significantly higher in patient group with DCM than those in the control group (P<0.001). The result of EF was significantly lower in patients with DCM than in normal subjects (P<0.001), but SV showed no significant difference between the two groups (P>0.05). In the DCM group, the results showed a significantly negative correlation between left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and SDI (r=-0.697, P<0.001), and there was also a moderate correlation between LVEF and right ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF) (r=0.496, P<0.01). The results of ESV, EDV and EF showed no significant differences as measured by RT-3DE or CMRI in the patient group (P>0.05), and there was also good correlation between the two measurements (LVEF: r=0.89, P<0.01; RVEF: r=0.85, P<0.01). CONCLUSION: Left and right ventricular systolic function in DCM could be evaluated by RT-3DE with left and right ventricular systolic function parameters.
