During Pregnancy, heart develops physiological left ventricular hypertrophy as a result of the natural volume overload. Previously we have characterized the molecular and functional signature of heart hypertrophy during pregnancy. Cardiac hypertrophy during pregnancy is a complex process that involves many changes including in the signalling pathways, composition of extracellular matrix as well as the levels of sex hormones. This review summarises the recent advances and the new frontiers in the context of heart hypertrophy during pregnancy. In particular we focus on structural and extracellular matrix remodelling as well as signalling pathways in pregnancy-induced physiological heart hypertrophy. Emerging evidence shows that various microRNAs modulate key components of hypertrophy, therefore the role of microRNAs in the regulation of gene expression in pregnancy induced hypertrophy is also discussed. We also review the role of ubiquitin proteasome system, the major machinery for the degradation of damaged and misfolded proteins, in heart hypertrophy. The role of sex hormones in particular estrogen in cardiac remodeling during pregnancy is also discussed. We also review pregnancy-induced cardiovascular complications such as peripartum cardiomyopathy and pre-eclampsia and how the knowledge from the animal studies may help us to develop new therapeutic strategies for better treatment of cardiovascular diseases during pregnancy. Special emphasis has to be given to the guidelines on disease management in pregnancy.
