Desmin cardiomyopathy is a rare cause of congestive heart failure. Its clinical manifestation in adulthood often is associated with conduction disorders and a neuromuscular phenotype. Only a few cases have been reported, with early manifestation in childhood mostly due to severe cardiomyopathy dilationand conduction abnormalities. However, the disease can result in the variety of clinical phenotypes, including hypertrophic, restrictive, and arrthythmogenic cardiomyopathy. This report describes the first case of desmin cardiomyopathy with early manifestation in adolescence and transformation of several clinical phenotypes over time, representing sufficient difficulties for the correct clinical diagnosis and treatment of the disease at an early stage.
