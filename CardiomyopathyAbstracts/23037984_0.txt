Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is a uremic toxin with multiple systemic effects including bone disorders (renal osteodystrophy), myopathy, neurologic abnormalities, anemia, pruritus, and cardiomyopathy. Hyperparathyroidism is common in CKD and results in significant morbidity and mortality if left untreated. Clinical practice guidelines from the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes initiative broadened the optimal PTH range to >2 and <9 times the upper limit of normal for the assay measured. Furthermore, the guidelines recommend following trends in PTH to determine the appropriate therapy. These guidelines overcome issues with the assay variability and help clinicians make judgments when treating individual patients. They also require frequent measurement in order to determine trends and implement appropriate treatments.
