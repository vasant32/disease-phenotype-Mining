Ventricular tachycardia as a late complication of blunt chest trauma has never been reported. We present a case of combined endocardial and epicardial delineation of the right ventricular arrhythmogenic substrate, where other causes of cardiomyopathy were excluded. The epicardial scar was more extensive than endocardial scar, and the central isthmus was likely intramural. A history of blunt chest trauma should be considered in patients with right ventricular cardiomyopathy.
