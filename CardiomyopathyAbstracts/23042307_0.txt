5-fluorouracil (5-FU) is a key chemotherapeutic agent in the treatment of many gastrointestinal  tract adenocarcinomas. Despite its proven therapeutic efficacy, 5-FU also possesses several  undesired cardiac toxicities, including coronary vasospasm, coronary thrombosis, cardiomyopathy,  and sudden cardiac death. This review addresses the incidence, mechanisms of action,  clinical presentation, risk stratification, and management of 5-FU associated cardiotoxicity; it  also highlights the importance of careful pre-administration cardiac risk stratification and  close monitoring during and after drug administration.
