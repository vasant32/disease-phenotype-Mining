Significant prolongation of the QT interval in pediatric patients with cardiomyopathy is rare. We report two cases of dilated myopathy with transient and dramatic QT prolongation. Both had associated ventricular arrhythmias, with one having torsade de pointes, and the other nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. Normalization of their QTc occurred as their ventricular function improved.
