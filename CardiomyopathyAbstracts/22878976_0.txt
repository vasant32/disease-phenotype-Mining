Cardiac fibroblasts are the most abundant cell in the mammalian heart. While they have been historically overlooked in terms of functional contributions to development and physiology, cardiac fibroblasts are now front and center. They are currently recognized as key protagonists during both normal development and cardiomyopathy disease, and work together with cardiomyocytes through paracrine, structural, and potentially electrical interactions. However, the lack of specific biomarkers and fibroblast heterogeneous nature currently convolutes the study of this dynamic cell lineage; though, efforts to advance marker analysis and lineage mapping technologies are ongoing. These tools will help elucidate the functional significance of fibroblast-cardiomyocyte interactions in vivo and delineate the dynamic nature of normal and pathological cardiac fibroblasts. Since therapeutic promise lies in understanding the interface between developmental biology and the postnatal injury response, future studies to understand the divergent roles played by cardiac fibroblasts both in utero and following cardiac insult are essential.
