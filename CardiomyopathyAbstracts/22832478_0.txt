Although rare in adults, coarctation of the aorta can present as an occult cause of cardiomyopathy. In this case report, we describe a 55-year-old man who presented to our clinic with new-onset symptoms of heart failure. Transthoracic echocardiography showed a dilated left ventricle with severely depressed systolic function. Cardiac catheterisation showed no critical coronary artery disease but a severe aortic coarctation just distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery, with a peak-to-peak systolic pressure gradient of 40 mmHg. We successfully implanted a balloon-expandable stent with good angiographic results. The procedure resulted in immediate clinical improvement. Six-months after stent implantation, the patient was free of symptoms and an echocardiographic examination showed completely normalised cardiac size and systolic function.
