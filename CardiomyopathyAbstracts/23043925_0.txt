 OBJECTIVE: Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) patterns of cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) relying on PSIR (phase-sensitive inversion recovery sequence) techniques had been used to determine the characteristics of LGE in apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (ApHCM). METHODS: Forty patients pure ApHCM [age, (60.2±10.4) years, 31 men] were enrolled. LGE images were acquired using PSIR, and analyzed using a 17-segment model. Summing the LGE areas in all short axis slices yielded the total volume of late enhancement, which was subsequently presented as a proportion of total LV myocardium (% LGE). RESULTS: Mean maximal apical wall thickness was (17.9±2.3) mm, and mean left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction was (67.7±8.0)%. LGE was detected in 130 segments of 30 patients (75.0%), occupying (4.9±5.5)% of LV myocardium. LGE was mainly detected at the junction between left and right ventricles in 12 (30%) and at the apex in 28 (70%), although LGE-positive areas were widely distributed, and not limited to the apex. Focal LGE at the non-hypertrophic LV segments was found in some ApHCM patients, even without LGE of hypertrophied apical segments. CONCLUSIONS: LGE was frequently observed not only in the thickened apex of the heart but also in other LV segments, irrespective of the presence or absence of hypertrophy. The simple presence of LGE on CMR was not representative of adverse prognosis in this population.
