The use of drugs is the subject of numerous recommendations. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of drug-related sudden deaths (SD) and the possible changes during these past 20years. METHODS: 271 patients, 205 men, 66 women aged from 12 to 88years (mean 59Â±15) were admitted after SD resuscitation outside the acute phase of myocardial infarction, 146 before 2000 (group I), 125 between 2000 and 2010 (group II). Complete check-up was performed. RESULTS: Ischemic HD (41%) vs (37%), idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (12%) vs (11%), various HD (5%) vs (8%) were as frequent in groups I and II. Valvular HDs were more frequent in group I than II (12%) vs 6% (p<0.01). Abnormalities at ECG (preexcitation syndrome, conduction disturbance, atrial fibrillation or ion channel disorders) were less frequent in group I than II (8%) vs (18%) (p<0.02). Drug-facilitated or related SD's did not change in groups I and II: 54 patients presented a drug-related ventricular fibrillation or asystole, 16% in group I and 24% (NS) in group II. SD was caused by hypokalemia, QT interval increase or conduction disturbance. HD or abnormal ECG was present in 42 patients. Digoxin, diuretics, calcium inhibitors, betablockers, antiarrhythmic drugs alone or in association were mainly implicated. CONCLUSION: Drug-related arrhythmias continue to explain or favour at least 20% of SDs. Despite numerous recommendations on the use of drugs, the prevalence of fatal events that may be attributed to a cardiovascular drug does not decrease between the years before 2000 and after 2000.
