 OBJECTIVES: To evaluate diastolic function (DF) of children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM1). SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Cross-sectional study of 67 otherwise healthy diabetic patients, and a control group (n = 84) in regard to age, sex, body mass index (BMI), Dopplere-chocardiography, and ECG for both groups; and disease duration, HbA1C, microalbuminuria, and serum lipids for DM 1 patients. RESULTS: Diastolic alterations [(A and E mitral waves, E/A ratio, isovolumic relaxation time (IVRT) and E wave deceleration time (EWDT)] were found in diabetic patients, with higher prevalence among pubertal girls (13-17 years old). IVRT and EWDT correlated positively with BMI (p = 0.028). Chronological age and disease duration were predictive factors for mitral A wave (p = 0.004 and 0.033, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: DF alterations were detected in the group of diabetic patients, with greater prevalence among pubertal girls; disease duration and age influenced parameters of DF.
