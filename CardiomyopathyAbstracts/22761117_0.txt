In patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, myocardial fibrosis is an independent predictor of an adverse outcome. A new technique of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) surgical correction in patients with severe hypertrophy and septal myocardial fibrosis has been proposed. This approach avoids mechanical damage to the heart conduction system, and for the surgeon it improves visual inspection of the area to be resected. We present a case report of a 33-year old female patient with biventricular obstruction, extreme hypertrophy, septal myocardial fibrosis and episodes of ventricular tachycardia who underwent surgical correction according to this novel procedure. The advantage of the approach is an effective surgical treatment of HOCM in patients with severe hypertrophy and septal myocardial fibrosis who cannot be treated with the current surgical techniques.
