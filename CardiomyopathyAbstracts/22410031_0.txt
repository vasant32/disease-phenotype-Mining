 PURPOSE: Patients with advanced liver diseases are at increased risk of cardiovascular events, resulting in a higher incidence of cardiac complications following liver transplantation (OLT). We assessed the clinical value of computed tomographic coronary arteriography (CTCAG) as a routine preoperative cardiac evaluation test in adult patients scheduled for living donor OLT (LDLT). METHODS: This single-center, prospective, observational study evaluated 247 adult patients being assessed for LDLT from April 2010 to March 2011. CTCAG was performed in patients with all-negative findings on routine cardiac workup, including thallium single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). RESULTS: Of the 247 patients evaluated, 27 (10.9%) showed abnormal findings on CTCAG, with 18 (7.3%) showing mild to moderate involvement of one vessel; 7 (2.8%), two-vessel; and 2 (0.8%), three-vessel involvement. Coronary artery calcification was identified in patients with significant coronary artery stenosis. No adverse events occurred after CTCAG. Noticeable hypotensive episodes during LDLT surgery occurred in 5% of patients, mostly related to massive bleeding or postperfusion syndrome. During the first 3 months after LDLT, 3% of patients showed stress cardiomyopathy, but all recovered with supportive care. CONCLUSIONS: The poor general medical condition of LDLT candidates and the diagnostic accuracy of CTCAG suggest that this test should be included in the routine pretransplant cardiac workup, along with thallium SPECT, for these patients.
