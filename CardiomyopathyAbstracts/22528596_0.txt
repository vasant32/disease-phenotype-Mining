Diabetes causes cardiomyopathy, both directly and by potentiating the effect of its common comorbidities, coronary artery disease and hypertension, on its development. With the common and growing prevalence of diabetes worldwide, diabetic cardiomyopathy is a significant public health problem. Recent research identifies both mitochondrial dysfunction and epigenetic effects as newly recognized factors in the complex pathogenesis of diabetic cardiomyopathy. Diagnostically, specialized echocardiography techniques, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, and serologic biomarkers all appear to have promise in detecting the early stages of diabetic cardiomyopathy. Research into treatments includes both traditional diabetes and heart failure therapies, but also explores the potential of newer metabolic and anti-inflammatory agents. These recent insights provide important additions to our knowledge about diabetic cardiomyopathy, but much remains unknown.
