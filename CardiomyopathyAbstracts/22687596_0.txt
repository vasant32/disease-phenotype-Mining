Unique genetic characteristics of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), including heterogeneity and incomplete penetrance, have made making predictions about prognosis complex. We reviewed data from septal myectomy results as published from 1980 to 2011, most of which come from specialized tertiary care centers. We also performed a retrospective review of 132 consecutive patients who underwent HCM surgery at our institution. At a mean follow-up of 4.2 Â± 3.2 years (range, 3 days to 14.2 years), there were no deaths within 30 days of surgery for our cohort. Over the course of 15 years, 2 deaths occurred in older patients, both of whom had surgery for HCM along with additional cardiac procedures. Age, the presence of comorbidities, and concomitant cardiac procedures were not statistically significant risk factors for mortality. Overall survival at 1, 5, and 10 years was excellent: 99%, 99%, and 92%, respectively. Surgical myectomy has been proven to be a safe and effective procedure for symptomatic obstructive HCM, and it confers excellent survival similar to that of the healthy population.
