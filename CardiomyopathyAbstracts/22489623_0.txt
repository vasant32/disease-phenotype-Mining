The objective of this work was to investigate the effect of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy-linked A8V and E134D mutations in cardiac troponin C (cTnC) on the response of reconstituted thin filaments to calcium upon phosphorylation of cardiac troponin I (cTnI) by protein kinase A. The phosphorylation of cTnI at protein kinase A sites was mimicked by the S22D/S23D double mutation in cTnI. Our results demonstrate that the A8V and E134D mutations had no effect on the extent of calcium desensitization of reconstituted thin filaments induced by cTnI pseudophosphorylation. However, the A8V mutation enhanced the effect of cTnI pseudophosphorylation on the rate of dissociation of calcium from reconstituted thin filaments and on the calcium dependence of actomyosin ATPase. Consequently, while the A8V mutation still led to a slower rate of dissociation of calcium from reconstituted thin filaments upon pseudophosphorylation of cTnI, the ability of the A8V mutation to decrease the rate of calcium dissociation was weakened. In addition, the ability of the A8V mutation to sensitize actomyosin ATPase to calcium was weakened after cTnI was replaced by the phosphorylation mimetic of cTnI. Consistent with the hypothesis that the E134D mutation is benign, it exerted a minor to no effect on the rate of dissociation of calcium from reconstituted thin filaments or on the calcium sensitivity of actomyosin ATPase, regardless of the cTnI phosphorylation status. In conclusion, our study enhances our understanding of how cardiomyopathy-linked cTnC mutations affect the response of reconstituted thin filaments to calcium upon cTnI phosphorylation.
