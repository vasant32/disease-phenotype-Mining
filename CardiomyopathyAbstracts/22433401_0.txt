 OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of creatine phosphate (CP) in the treatment of myocardial damage following neonatal asphyxia. METHODS: Medical databases were searched for a systematic literature review and meta-analysis of randomized and quasi-randomized trials on the treatment of myocardial damage with CP following neonatal asphyxia. The data was analyzed using Review Manager 5.1. RESULTS: Six trials involving 400 patients (CP treatment/control: 202/198) were included in the survey. The meta-analysis indicated that CP treatment for 7 days decreased serum myocardial enzyme levels (CK, CK-MB, LDH, HBDH and cTnI levels). Both the total effective rate (RR: 1.29; 95% CI: 1.12, 1.48) and the significantly effective rate (RR: 1.78; 95% CI: 1.32, 2.41) in the CP treatment group were significantly higher than in the control group. CP treatment reduced the hospitalization period by 4.07 days compared with the control group (95% CI: -5.25, -2.89). CONCLUSIONS: CP treatment appears to be more effective than routine treatment alone for myocardial damage following neonatal asphyxia. It appears to be safe and it can both decrease serum myocardial enzyme levels and shorten the period of hospitalization. However, as the evidence obtained in this study is not robust due to the poor quality of current studies, further studies of high-quality, large-scale trails are needed.
