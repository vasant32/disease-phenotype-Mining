Systematic clinical assessment and careful monitoring of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) can be used to identify a cohort of patients that benefit from medical intervention and almost certainly improve long-term outcomes. One of the major limitations of the current approach is a lack of predictive power of individual risk factors, which means that many patients receive therapy. The aim of this review is to highlight other aspects of the disease, assessed using old and new medical technologies, that appear to provide new prognostic information. The hope for the future is that their incorporation in new risk algorithms will improve treatment for all HCM patients with the disease, irrespective of their vulnerability to adverse complications.
