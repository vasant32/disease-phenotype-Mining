We report a case of Takotsubo syndrome after epilepsy, and review the literature. We identified 59 cases of Takotsubo syndrome after focal or generalised epilepsy. As in Takotsubo syndrome in general, the patients were mostly female (84%), with a mean age of 63 years, and the evolution was generally favourable. There was one death and one stroke, and 4 cases were of relapsing Takotsubo after a new seizure. Takotsubo syndrome may induce cardiac arrhythmias. A near-SUDEP (sudden unexplained death in epilepsy) was reported in one patient. Animal models of SUDEP have shown similar cardiac lesions to those seen in Takotsubo syndrome, and strengthen the hypothesis of a link between these conditions. Takotsubo syndrome after epilepsy may be relatively common; we suggest measurement of serum troponin levels in high-risk patients and cardiac follow-up.
