Idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC) has been hypothesized as a multifactorial disorder initiated by an environment trigger in individuals with predisposing human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles. Published data on the association between HLA-DR polymorphism and IDC risk are inconclusive. To derive a more precise estimation of the relationship, a meta-analysis was performed. A total of 19 case-control studies including 1,378 cases and 10,383 controls provided data on the association between HLA-DR polymorphism and genetic susceptibility to IDC. Overall, statistically elevated frequencies of HLA-DR4 (OR 1.58; 95% CI 1.21-2.07; P=0.0009) and HLA-DR5 (OR 1.35; 95% CI 1.05-1.73; P=0.02) alleles were found in patients with IDC compared with controls. Individuals with HLA-DR3 antigen have a protective effect against IDC (OR 0.72; 95% CI 0.58-0.90; P=0.004). In summary, this meta-analysis indicated that certain HLA-DR alleles may be genetic markers for susceptibility and resistance to IDC.
