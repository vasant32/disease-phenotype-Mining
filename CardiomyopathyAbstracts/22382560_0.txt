Mutation in the transthyretin (TTR) gene may clinically manifest as cardiomyopathy. Here, we describe 69-year-old and 72-year-old brothers who were diagnosed as having TTR-related familial amyloid cardiomyopathy by endomyocardial biopsy at different hospitals at around the same time. They were not from an endemic area of familial amyloid polyneuropathy. Genetic analysis showed a base change in the TTR gene leading to a p.Val30Met mutation in both patients. Screening of family members, as well as detailed family history taking, is important for the diagnosis of cardiomyopathy of unknown etiology.
