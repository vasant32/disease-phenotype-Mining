Surgical revascularization of left main and/or three-vessel coronary artery disease (CAD) is associated with improved survival in patients with left ventricular dysfunction when compared to medical therapy and can result in improved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) [1]. Multivessel percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is equivalent to surgery regarding short and intermediate term mortality, and left main PCI has emerged as a safe and effective alternate to surgical revascularization [2]. However, outcomes of unprotected left main PCI in patients with severely depressed LVEF have not been examined. We report a patient with left main chronic total occlusion, multivessel CAD, and dilated cardiomyopathy, in whom complete revascularization via PCI resulted in decreased left ventricular size and improved LVEF.
