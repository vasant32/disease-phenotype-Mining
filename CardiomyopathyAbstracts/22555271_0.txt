 BACKGROUND: Cardiomyopathy is a heterogeneous disease with a strong genetic component. A research-based pediatric cardiomyopathy registry identified familial, syndromic, or metabolic causes in 30% of children. However, these results predated clinical genetic testing. METHODS AND RESULTS: We determined the prevalence of familial, syndromic, or metabolic causes in 83 consecutive unrelated patients referred for genetic evaluation of cardiomyopathy from 2006 to 2009. Seventy-six percent of probands (n = 63) were categorized as familial, syndromic, or metabolic. Forty-three percent (n = 18) of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) patients had mutations in sarcomeric genes, with MYH7 and MYBPC3 mutations predominating. Syndromic (17%; n = 7) and metabolic (26%; n = 11) causes were frequently identified in HCM patients. The metabolic subgroup was differentiated by decreased endocardial shortening fraction on echocardiography. Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) patients had similar rates of syndromic (20%; n = 5) and metabolic (16%; n = 4) causes, but fewer familial cases (24%; n = 6) compared with HCM patients. CONCLUSIONS: The cause of cardiomyopathy is identifiable in a majority of affected children. An underlying metabolic or syndromic cause is identified in >35% of children with HCM or DCM. Identification of etiology is important for management, family-based risk assessment, and screening.
