Alternative splicing ensures the expression of functionally diverse proteins from individual genes; however, aberrant mRNA splicing is associated with various conditions, including heart disease. A recent study provides new mechanistic insights into heart failure by showing that a human cardiomyopathy-linked mutation in a cardiac splice factor affects post-transcriptional regulation, causing the expression of anomalous isoforms of a whole network of cardiac proteins (pages 766-773).
