Noncompaction of ventricular myocardium (NCVM) is a rare congenital cardiomyopathy characterized by numerous excessively prominent trabeculations and intertrabecular recesses in the myocardium without any other cardiac structural abnormality. Transthoracic echocardiography is the imaging modality of choice for diagnosing NCVM. Although this disease commonly affects the left ventricle, the right ventricle or both ventricles can rarely be affected. We report the case of an 18-year-old male patient with NCVM involving both ventricles. Â© 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Clin Ultrasound, 2012.
