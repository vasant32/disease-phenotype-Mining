We present a case of successful resuscitation from cardiac arrest after 25 minutes of ventricular fibrillation (VF) secondary to peripartum cardiomyopathy. This case highlights a rare disease, but also, more importantly, the successful use of the five links of survival: early access to 9-1-1, early cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), early defibrillation, early advanced life support, and postresuscitative care. We also demonstrate the importance of high-quality resuscitation practices in order to achieve a successful outcome. Manual compressions can be performed at a guidelines-compliant rate. With training, users are able to achieve high compression fractions. Pre/post shock delays can be minimized to further increase compression fraction. Nationally, CPR interruptions are often long. We recommend closer attention to uninterrupted 2-minute cycles of CPR, minimizing delays in CPR through training, and a focus on a closely choreographed approach. User review of transthoracic impedance feedback data should play a vital role in a cardiac arrest quality-improvement program.
