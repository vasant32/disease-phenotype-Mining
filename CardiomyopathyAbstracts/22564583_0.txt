 PURPOSE: Heart transplantation is indicated for children with end-stage heart failure or complex inoperable congenital defects. When the transplanted heart fails, retransplantation is suggested and herein we have presented the prognosis of these pediatric cases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From March 1987 to March 2011, we performed 404 heart transplantations including 45 pediatric patients, 6 (13.3%) of whom experienced graft failure requiring retransplantation. Only four of the six patients (66.7%) had a chance for retransplantation. RESULTS: Six of 45 pediatric heart transplant patients (13.3%) experienced graft failure requiring retransplantation. Four of them (66.7%) underwent retransplantation. Only one of the four died due to severe postoperative sepsis with acute respiratory distress. The other three patients recovered well and remain alive with no neurological sequelae; all are in New York Heart Association functional classification I at present. CONCLUSION: Pediatric post-heart graft failure require expectations retransplantation, which shows a good prognosis.
