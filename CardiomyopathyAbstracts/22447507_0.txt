A 58-year-old woman presented with severe left ventricular dysfunction and malignant arrhythmias after taking combination drug treatment for weight loss. The combination treatment included sibutramine, liothyronine, hydrochlorothiazide diuretic, metformin and fucus. The effect of these drugs individually and in combination is discussed, with particular reference to it being a malignant combination. The patient showed reversability of the left ventricular dysfunction and negative ventricular stimulation studies after cessation of the drug concoction.
