 OBJECTIVE: To report a case of hyperthyroidism associated with Hürthle cell carcinoma and to review the literature regarding this relationship. METHODS: We describe the clinical, biochemical, radiologic, and pathologic data of a patient with Hürthle cell carcinoma associated with thyrotoxicosis and reversible heart failure. We discuss the mechanistic aspects and review previously reported cases of functional Hürthle cell carcinomas. RESULTS: A 43-year-old woman presented with thyrotoxicosis and nonischemic cardiomyopathy. She had a "hot" nodule in the left lobe of the thyroid on sodium pertechnetate scan. She underwent a left hemithyroidectomy and isthmusectomy. Pathologic findings revealed a minimally invasive Hürthle cell carcinoma. On follow-up, the dilated cardiomyopathy had resolved. The association of thyroid carcinoma with thyrotoxicosis is rare. CONCLUSIONS: Some Hürthle cell carcinomas can be functional and lead to thyrotoxicosis. To our knowledge, we present the first case of reversible dilated cardiomyopathy due to thyrotoxicosis originating from Hürthle cell carcinoma.
