Pericarditis is the commonest form of cardiac involvement in tuberculosis whereas myocardial involvement is exceedingly rare. We hereby report a patient who presented with cardiac tuberculosis manifesting as predominantly right-sided cardiomyopathy. In addition to being a very rare clinical presentation, this case provided an interesting insight into the left ventricular (LV) myocardial mechanics. The patient had nearly preserved contractile function of the LV myocardium (except for segmental abnormalities in circumferential strain) but had marked impairment of torsion resulting in LV systolic dysfunction. Such disproportionate loss of LV torsion leading to LV systolic dysfunction has not been previously described on echocardiography. These myocardial mechanical abnormalities almost completely recovered with adequate antitubercular treatment. Thus, this case proved to be a unique demonstration of the significant, independent role played by torsion in maintenance of normal LV systolic function.
