Apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (AHCM) is a rare variant of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy usually seen in Japanese and other Asian populations. It is characterized by left ventricular hypertrophy limited to the apex. The authors describe a case of AHCM in an African-American patient who presented with symptoms of acute coronary syndrome. Coronary angiogram showed normal unobstructed coronary arteries, whereas left ventricular angiogram revealed an 'ace of spades' sign at the end of diastole that is pathognomonic of AHCM. On follow-up echocardiogram 1 year later, the patient was noted to have developed a left ventricular aneurysm. Although ventricular aneurysms are known to occur with AHCM, they are usually found on presentation and, rarely, can develop on follow-up as seen in this patient.
