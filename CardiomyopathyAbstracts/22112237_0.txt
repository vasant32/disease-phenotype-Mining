Adriamycin (ADR) is a potent anticancer drug used to treat a variety of cancers. Patients treated with ADR have experienced side effects such as heart failure, cardiomyopathy, and "chemobrain", which have been correlated to changes in protein expression in the heart and brain. In order to better understand cellular responses that are disrupted following ADR treatment in immune tissues, this work focuses on spleen. Significantly reduced spleen sizes were found in ADR-treated mice. Global isotopic labeling of tryptic peptides and nanoflow reversed-phase liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) were employed to determine differences in the relative abundances of proteins from ADR-treated mice relative to controls. Fifty-nine proteins of the 388 unique proteins identified showed statistically significant differences in expression levels following acute ADR treatment. Differentially expressed proteins are involved in processes such as cytoskeletal structural integrity, cellular signaling and transport, transcription and translation, immune response, and Ca(2+) binding. These are the first studies to provide insight to the downstream effects of ADR treatment in a peripheral immune organ such as spleen using proteomics.
