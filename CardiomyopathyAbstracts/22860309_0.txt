A 15-year-old man developed cardiopulmonary dysfunction 4 days after flu-like symptom, and was transfered to our hospital and diagnosed as a fulminant myocarditis (FM). Intraaortic ballon pumping (IABP) and percutaneous cardiopulmonary support (PCPS) were immediately initiated. However, cardiac function did not recover until 7 days after admission to the ICU, and bilateral ventricular assist devices (BiVAD) were introduced with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Right ventricular assist device (RVAD) with ECMO was established by right atrial blood withdrawal and pulmonary arterial blood supply using centrifugal pump. After operation of BiVAD, to main LVAD flow, frequent blood-and-fluids volume loading and increase in RVAD flow were necessary due to postoperative bleeding and massive foamy sputum. However, even after hemostasis had been established, the pulmonary edema continued and it was difficult to maintain LVAD flow because of endless transudation from the lungs. Eventually, he developed MOF and passed away 9 days after the admission to ICU. As in cases of end-stage dilated cardiomyopathy, outflow of RVAD into the left atrium instead of the pulmonary artery was demonstrated effective in avoiding trans-pulmonary leakage, and outflow of RVAD into the left atrium may be beneficial to patients with FM who need BiVAD but suffered severe pulmonary edema.
