Cardiomyopathy syndrome (CMS) in Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar L., is characterized by focal infiltration in the spongy myocardium and endocardium of the heart. The origin of the mononuclear infiltrate is unknown. Using experimentally infected fish, we investigated localization of the causative agent, piscine myocarditis virus (PMCV), within the heart and characterized the cell population associated with myocardial lesions. Cellular and transcriptional characteristics in the lesions were compared with adjacent non-infiltrated tissues using laser capture microdissection, RT-qPCR and immunohistochemistry. Our results reveal that PMCV is almost exclusively present in myocardial lesions. The inflammatory infiltrate comprises a variety of leucocyte populations, including T cells, B cells, MHC class II(+) and CD83(+) cells, most likely of the macrophage line. Correlation analyses demonstrated co-ordinated leucocyte activity at the site of the virus infection. Cellular proliferation and/or DNA repair was demonstrated within the myocardial lesions. Different cell populations, mainly myocytes, stained positive for proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). Densities of endothelial cells and fibroblasts were not significantly increased. The simultaneous presence of PMCV and various inflammatory cells in all myocardial lesions analysed may indicate that both viral lytic and immunopathological effects may contribute to the pathogenesis of CMS.
