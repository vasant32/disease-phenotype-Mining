Diagnosis of early-phase Takayasu's arteritis (TA) is extremely difficult and overlooked as most often presentation is nonspecific and mimics various other diseases. Early diagnosis and initiation of proper therapy could alter the natural course of the disease. We describe an adolescent male presenting with pyrexia of unknown origin and clinical features simulating idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. Transthoracic echocardiography was suggestive of dilated cardiomyopathy with severe left ventricular dysfunction. Later vascular ultrasonography and CT aortography showed extensive thickening of intima-media of aorta and its major branches suggestive of inflammatory phase of TA. We discuss the role of noninvasive imaging in diagnosis of clinically masked prepulseless inflammatory phase of TA. (Echocardiography 2012;29:59-63)).
