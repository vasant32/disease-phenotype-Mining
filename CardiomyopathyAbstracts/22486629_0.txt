Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is characterized by hypertrophy of the left ventricle, with variable clinical manifestations and morphologic and hemodynamic abnormalities. False tendons (FTs) are discrete, fibromuscular structures of varying length and thickness that tranverse either left and right ventricular cavities. Left and right ventricular FTs were giving a false impression of HCM. Misdiagnosis of HCM can lead to undue anxiety, unnecessary medication, and further evaluation. Three-dimensional (3D) transthoracic echocardiography is additive to conventional two-dimensional imaging in these patients in terms of 3D perspective and anatomically correct examination. We present a 32-year-old male who was misdiagnosed as asymetrical septal hypertrophy.
