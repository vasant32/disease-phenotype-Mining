Isolated left ventricular non-compaction (LVNC) is a rare disorder, classified as a primary genetic cardiomyopathy by the American Heart Association or as an unclassified cardiomyopathy by the European Society of Cardiology Working Group on Myocardial and Pericardial Diseases. The key features are the prominent trabeculae and deep intratrabecular recesses resulting in thickened myocardium with the two layers consisting of compacted and non-compacted myocardium. These recesses are in continuity with the left ventricular cavity and are filled with blood without evidence of communication to the epicardial coronary artery system. We present a case of LVNC detected prenatally at 25 + 4 weeks of gestation.
