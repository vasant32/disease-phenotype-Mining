 PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Connexins are the pore forming subunits of gap junction channels. They are essential for cardiac action potential propagation. Connexins are modified at the transcriptional or posttranslational levels under pathological states such as cardiac hypertrophy or ischemia, thus contributing to the arrhythmogenic substrate. However, the relation between nucleotide substitutions in the connexin gene and the occurrence of cardiac arrhythmias remains largely unexplored. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies have reported an association between nucleotide substitutions in the connexin40 (Cx40) and connexin43 (Cx43) genes (GJA5 and GJA1, respectively) and cardiac arrhythmias. Of note, however, germline mutations in Cx43 are considered causative of oculodentodigital dysplasia, a pleiotropic syndrome wherein cardiac manifestations are notoriously absent. SUMMARY: Here, we review some of the current knowledge on the association between cardiac connexins and inherited arrhythmias.
