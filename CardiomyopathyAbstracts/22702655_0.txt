BACKGROUND: A specific acromegaly-related cardiomyopathy has been described in the literature, largely in Caucasians, which is independent of other risk factors, mainly hypertension. OBJECTIVE: This study assessed the cardiac changes in acromegalics of significant ethnic diversity and also the relevance of the aetiopathogenic factors involved, such as disease activity and hypertension. DESIGN: It is a cross-sectional study with a comparative control group. Patients and methods: In this study, 37 acromegalic patients (20 Intermediate-skinned (IS), 14 Dark-skinned (DS) and 3 Light-skinned (LS) individuals) and 74 controls matched by age, gender and hypertension were evaluated. Cardiac morphology and function were addressed using echocardiography parameters. RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 46.9 ± 12.8 years, with 67.6% being female and 43.2% hypertensive. The prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) between acromegalics was 56.8% versus 10.8% in the controls (p< 0.001). About 86% of patients with LVH had active disease (p = 0.023). Logistic regression revealed that disease activity presented a stronger association (OR = 5.925; CI = 1.085 - 32.351; p = 0.040) with LVH than hypertension (OR = 3.237; CI = 0.702 - 14.924; p = 0.132). When DS acromegalics were compared to IS ones, no statistically significant differences were observed. CONCLUSION: Chronically hyperactive somatotropic axis remains as an independent and determining factor in the development of LVH, as it is more associated with this condition than hypertension in a largely admixed population with a high degree of African ancestry © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.
