This review article discusses the genetic bases of cardiac arrest with a specific focus on cardiac channelopathies and right ventricular cardiomyopathy. We review the appropriate use of genetic testing in those patients suspected to have inherited cardiac arrhythmias, highlighting the importance of most genotype-phenotype correlations for risk stratification. The article also presents the most recent views on diagnostic criteria and flowcharts for treatment of patients with inherited arrhythmogenic diseases.
