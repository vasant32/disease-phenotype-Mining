 INTRODUCTION: Cardiac dyssynchrony causes disorganised cardiac contraction, delayed wall contraction and reduced pumping efficiency. We aimed to assess the prevalence of different types of dyssynchrony in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), and to establish the correlation between atrio-ventricular block and atrio-ventricular dyssynchrony (AVD), and between impaired intra-ventricular conduction and the existence of inter-ventricular dyssynchrony (inter-VD) and intra-left ventricular dyssynchrony (intra-LVD). METHODS: We included 40 patients in New York Heart Association stage III or IV, admitted consecutively with DCM with severe left ventricular dysfunction (left ventricular enddiastolic diameter ≥ 60 mm and/or ≥ 30 mm/m(2)) and left ventricular ejection fraction < 35%. Electrocardiographic and echocardiographic data were evaluated in all patients. Patients were divided into two groups: group 1: eight patients, with a QRS duration ≥ 120 ms, and all presented with left bundle branch block; group 2: 32 patients with a narrow QRS < 120 ms. RESULTS: Overall, the mean age was 54.7 ± 16.8 years and patients in group 1 were older (67.2 ± 13.6 vs 51.5 ± 15.8 years, p = 0.01). The prevalence of atrio-ventricular dyssynchrony (AVD), inter-VD and intra-LVD was respectively 40, 47.5 and 70%. Two patients (5%) did not exhibit dyssynchrony. AVD was present with a similar frequency in the two groups (37.5% in group 1 vs 40.6% in group 2, p = 0.8). There was no correlation of the magnitude of AVD with the duration of the PR interval (from the beginning of the P wave to the beginning of the QRS complex) (r(2) = 0.02, p = 0.37) or the QRS width (r(2) = 0.01, p = 0.38). A greater proportion of patients with inter-VD was observed in group 1 (87.5 vs 60%, p = 0.03). There was a trend towards a more important inter-ventricular mechanical delay according to QRS width (r(2) = 0.009, p = 0.06). The proportion of intra-LVD was  similar in all groups, with a high prevalence (87.5% in group 1 and 65.6% in group 2, p = 0.39). CONCLUSION: The assessment of cardiac dyssynchrony is possible in our country. Intra-ventricular mechanical dyssynchrony had a high prevalence in patients with DCM, irrespective of the QRS width. These data emphasise the usefulness of echocardiography in the screening of patients.
