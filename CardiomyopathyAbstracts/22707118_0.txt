 BACKGROUND: Hypertensive cardiomyopathy with reduced ejection fraction (HTCMREF) is known as an important cause of reversible cardiomyopathy, but its serial changes on echocardiography is yet to be elucidated. HYPOTHESIS: HTCMREF on serial echocardiography has distinctive points as compared to idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (idDCM). METHODS: We retrospectively studied 18 hypertensive patients (mean age, 63 ± 13 years, 56% women) admitted with severe left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction and heart failure. We compared clinical characteristics and echocardiographic parameters at admission and follow-up between the patients with HTCMREF and 18 age-matched patients with idDCM. Left ventricular mass (LVM) and left atrial volume (LAV) were calculated by a formula using echocardiographic measurement. RESULTS: In HTCMREF, left ventricular ejection fraction improved to 52.3 ± 8.8% during a mean follow-up of 574 days. In HTCMREF, initial left atrial diameter was greater than in idDCM (43.6 ± 5.8 mm vs 38.9 ± 6.3, p = 0.027). At follow-up, LAV index decreased in HTCMREF (from 31.9 ± 8.3 mL/m(2)  to 21.0 ± 8.9, P < 0.001), as opposed to a significant increase in idDCM (from 28.5 ± 10.9 mL/m(2)  to 31.9 ± 8.3, P < 0.001). There was no significant difference in initial LVM index between the 2 groups, but only in HTCMREF did LVM index decrease significantly (151.4 ± 42.1 g/m(2)  from 192.2 ± 43.7, P < 0.01) at follow-up. In HTCMREF, LV wall on M-mode was thicker than in idDCM. CONCLUSIONS: Hypertensive cardiomyopathy with severe LV systolic dysfunction might be characterized by eccentric left ventricular hypertrophy and enlarged left atrium in comparison with idDCM. Clin.
