Ventricular non-compaction or spongy myocardium is a rare type of cardiomyopathy resulting from arrested myocardial development during embryogenesis. This rare entity is characterized by excessive prominent trabeculations and deep inter-trabecular recesses in the ventricular wall. The clinical manifestations include heart failure, arrhythmias and cardioembolic events. The usual site of involvement is the left ventricle. Rarely the right ventricle (RV) is affected. Here we report a case of 40 year old male patient presenting with isolated RV non-compaction.
