 BACKGROUND: Surgical ventricular restoration (SVR) is considered as an effective surgical procedure for patients with ischemic myocardiopathy( ICM). However" surgical treatment for ischemic heart failure (STICH)" trial concluded that adding SVR to coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) did not relieve symptoms and failed to lower death rate or cardiac rehospitalization as compared with CABG alone. AIM: The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of CABG with SVR for ICM. METHODS AND RESULTS: We retrospectively studied 24 patients who had undergone CABG with or with out SVR for ICM from October 1992 to June 2008. In CABG with SVR group, cardiac symptoms were relieved and the left ventricular end-systolic volume index (LVESVI) was reduced from the baseline significantly. However cardiac symptoms were relieved only in CABG-S [left ventricular end-diastolic dimension (LVDd)<60 mm] group, and not in CABG-L (LVDdâ‰¥60 mm) group. LVESVI was not reduced in CABG without SVR group. CONCLUSION: SVR contributed to relieving the symptoms, and improving the left ventricular function and the long-term survival of patients with especially dilated ICM, which could not be achieved by CABG alone.
