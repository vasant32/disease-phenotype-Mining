A 57 year-old woman with no history of cardiac disease presented to the emergency department with confusion and seizures secondary to alcohol withdrawal. Elevated troponin levels and an electrocardiogram demonstrating global T-wave inversions prompted coronary angiography, which revealed coronary vessels free of significant disease. An echocardiogram showed both hypokinesis of the left-ventricular mid-segments with apical involvement and a hyperkinetic base consistent with tako-tsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM). Several clinical conditions have been reported as triggers of TCM. We report a case of TCM in a post-menopausal woman that was precipitated by alcohol withdrawal.
