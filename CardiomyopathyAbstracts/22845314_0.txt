Background and purpose.  Heart failure and atrial fibrillation are associated with apoptosis of cardiomyocytes, suggesting common abnormalities in pro-apoptotic cardiac molecules. Activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase EphA2 causes apoptosis in vitro, and dysregulation of EphA2-depdendent signaling is implicated in LEOPARD and Noonan syndromes associated with cardiomyopathy. Molecular pathways and regulation of EphA2 signaling in the heart are poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the pathways of EphA2-dependent apoptosis. In addition, a therapeutic strategy to prevent EphA2 activation and cardiac cell death was evaluated. Experimental approach.  EphA2 signaling was studied in an established HL-1 cell model of drug-induced apoptosis. Key results.  Apoptosis induced by doxazosin (EC(50) = 17.3 µmol/L) was associated with EphA2 activation through enhanced phosphorylation (2.2-fold, p = 0.031). Activation of pro-apoptotic downstream factors phospho-SHP-2 (3.9-fold, p = 0.007), phospho-p38 MAPK (2.3-fold, p = 0.007) and GADD153 (1.6-fold, p = 0.35) resulted in cleavage of caspase 3. Furthermore, anti-apoptotic enzymes were suppressed (focal adhesion kinase, -41%, p = 0.22; phospho-Akt, -78%, p = 0.002). SiRNA-mediated EphA2 inactivation mimicked pro-apoptotic effects of doxazosin. Finally, administration of lithocholic acid (LCA) protected from apoptosis through enhanced EphA2 protein levels and via prevention of EphA2 phosphorylation. Conclusions and implications.  EphA2 phosphorylation and activation of SHP-2 are critical steps in apoptosis. Reduction of EphA2 phosphorylation by lithocholic acid may represent a novel approach for future anti-apoptotic treatment of heart failure and atrial fibrillation. © 2012 The Authors.
