 AIMS: The factors responsible for cardiomyopathy are not fully understood. Our studies of the transcriptome of human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes identified novel genes up-regulated during cardiac differentiation, including RBM24. We therefore studied how its deficiency affected heart development. METHODS AND RESULTS: The expression of Rbm24 was detected in mouse cardiomyocytes and embryonic myocardium of zebrafish at the RNA and protein level. The Rbm24 loss-of-function showed that Rbm24 deficiency resulted in a reduction in sarcomeric proteins, Z-disc abnormality, and diminished heart contractility, resulting in the absence of circulation in zebrafish embryos. Gene expression profiling revealed down-regulation of multiple pathways associated with sarcomere assembly and vasculature development in Rbm24 deficiency. CONCLUSION: We identified a novel role of the tissue-specific RNA-binding protein (RBP) Rbm24 involving in the regulation of cardiac gene expression, sarcomeric assembly, and cardiac contractility. This study uncovers a potential novel pathway to cardiomyopathy through down-regulation of the RBP Rbm24.
