Abstractâ€ƒ Tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy associated with cardiogenic shock is a rare but well-known entity. We report an unusual case of cardiogenic shock with atrial tachycardia in postpartum; the patient underwent successful radiofrequency ablation under extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Radiofrequency ablation is usually used to treat this clinical situation. The use of ECMO has been described only in pediatric case. (J Card Surg 2012;27:647-649).
