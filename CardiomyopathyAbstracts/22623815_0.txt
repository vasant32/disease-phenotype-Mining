Recent advances in scanner technology have enabled computed tomography (CT) scan to evolve into a valuable tool in the noninvasive evaluation of coronary artery disease. Due to its high negative predictive value, CT can act as a gatekeeper, determining which patients require cardiac catheterization. Although mainly used for the evaluation of coronary artery disease, cardiac CT is also useful in the evaluation of various non-coronary cardiac conditions involving the pericardium, pulmonary veins, and the coronary veins and valves, as well as in the assessment of cardiomyopathies, masses, and ventricular and valvular function. This review discusses and illustrates the various non-coronary applications of cardiac CT.
