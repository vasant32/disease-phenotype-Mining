 BACKGROUND: The development of cardiovascular disease has been linked to lowered levels of epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) in the cardiovascular system. Ischemic cardiomyopathy is caused by atherosclerotic lesions in multi-coronary arteries especially diffusive lesions, which can lead to severe myocardial dysfunction, heart enlargement, heart failure, or arrhythmia, and so on. The EETs are metabolized by the soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) encoded by the EPHX2 gene that has several known polymorphisms. CONTENT: The EPHX2 gene polymorphism is associated with sEH catalytic activity and various cardiovascular diseases. sEH is distributed in a variety of organs and tissues and regulated by multiple factors. Research in the area has led to the presence of multiple powerful soluble epoxide hydrolase inhibitors (sEHIs), whose molecular structure and function has been optimized gradually. sEHIs increase EETs' concentration by inhibiting hydration of EETs into their corresponding vicinal diols. EETs are important signaling molecules and known as endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factors (EDHF). sEHIs have been developed for their ability to prevent atherosclerosis, dilate the coronary artery, promote angiogenesis, ameliorate postischemic recovery of heart contractile function, decrease ischemia/reperfusion injury, modulate postischemic arrhythmia, and prevent heart failure. SUMMARY: sEH is one of the etiological factors of cardiovascular diseases, and plays an important role in the progression of myocardium ischemia. This indicates that sEHIs provide a new method for the prevention and treatment of ischemic cardiomyopathy.
