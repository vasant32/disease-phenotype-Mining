 BACKGROUND: First and second-degree heart blocks are partly common rhythm disorders in thalassemic patients but complete heart block is a very rare complication of iron overload cardiomyopathy. CASE PRESENTATION: This 15-year-old boy, a known case of major Î²-thalassemia was admitted to our emergency unit with dyspnea and cough because of decompensated heart failure. The electrocardiogram showed complete heart block with junctional escape rhythm. Interestingly, his previous electrocardiogram taken 2 months earlier, had some PVC and second degree, Mobitz type 1 (Wenckebach) heart block. After improvement of dyspnea and control of blood pressure in normal range, the patient was referred to ER. A dual-chamber permanent pacemaker was implanted and his symptoms improved, but he died 24 days after discharge from hospital. CONCLUSION: We present a rare case of complete heart block after a second-degree (Mobitz 1) heart block that was due to severe iron overload cardiomyopathy.
