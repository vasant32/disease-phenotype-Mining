We retrospectively investigated 42 patients (27 men, 15 women; mean age, 67 years) with severe mitral valve incompetence and endstage cardiomyopathy (ejection fraction<30%) who were operated on between January 2002 and March 2009. Of these, 14 were in New York Heart Association class IV, and 27 were in class III. The etiology was ischemic in 18 patients and idiopathic dilated in 24. Mitral valve repair was performed in 25 patients, and 17 had mitral valve replacement. The mean logistic EuroSCORE was 33.41. The mean follow-up was 44.52 months. There were no perioperative deaths. Three patients died within 30 days postoperatively. Thirty-day mortality was lower than predicted by EuroSCORE (7.14% vs. 33.41%). The median functional class improved from 3 to 2 during follow-up. Ejection fraction improved from 24% to 42% at 6 weeks, then decreased to 33%. The midterm survival rate was 86%, and 81% after 1 and 2 years. Freedom from reoperation at 2 years was 85%; 6 patients needed reoperation for recurrent mitral regurgitation. Despite high operative risk, mitral valve surgery can be performed successfully with acceptably low mortality in patients with endstage cardiomyopathy. Patients experience substantial clinical improvement and a moderate recovery of left ventricular function.
