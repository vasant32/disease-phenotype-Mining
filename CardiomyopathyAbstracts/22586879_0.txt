Approximately 5.7 million people in the United States have a diagnosis of heart failure, and more than 3,100 patients are awaiting a heart transplant. A temporary total artificial heart (TAH-t, SynCardia Systems Inc, Tucson, Arizona) is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a bridge to transplant in patients at risk of dying of biventricular heart failure. Currently, TAH-t recipients awaiting transplant are hospital-bound and attached to a large pneumatic driver. In 2010, the FDA gave conditional approval for an Investigational Device Exemption clinical study of the portable Freedom driver (SynCardia). This case report describes a 61-year-old man admitted with acute decompensated heart failure, which progressively worsened, eventually requiring implantation of a TAH-t. Following stabilization, the patient was switched to the Freedom driver. After the patient and his wife proved competence in managing the device, they were able to take several daylong excursions outside the hospital. The patient considered discharge from the hospital while awaiting a transplant but ultimately received a heart transplant while still an inpatient. Higher rates of survival to transplant have already been proved with the TAH-t. Potential benefits for the portable Freedom driver include increased mobility, decreased cost, and improved quality of life.
