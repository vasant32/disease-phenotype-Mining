High level of physical training can lead cardiovascular quantitative and qualitative adaptations. These clinical, electrical and echocardiographic adaptations are called athlete's heart. These mainly moderated adaptations raise generally no diagnostic issue. However, in rare cases, the question of the limits of athlete's heart may arise. The differential diagnosis with the hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is important because this pathology, even treated, excludes for intense physical activity. On the contrary, an inequitable contraindication for competitive sport is not acceptable. In most cases, the athlete's heart diagnosis is easy in case of a good knowledge of its signs and a good rigor of exam. However, sometimes, the good diagnosis is proposed only on a beam of arguments.
