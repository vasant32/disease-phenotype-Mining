The myocardial interstitium is highly organized and orchestrated, whereby small disruptions in composition, spatial relationships, or content lead to altered myocardial systolic and/or diastolic performance. These changes in extracellular matrix structure and function are important in the progression to heart failure in pressure overload hypertrophy, dilated cardiomyopathy, and ischemic heart disease. The myocardial interstitium is not a passive entity, but rather a complex and dynamic microenvironment that represents an important structural and signaling system within the myocardium.
