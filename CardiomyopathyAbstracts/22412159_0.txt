This retrospective study was designed to assess the effect of pimobendan on the median survival time (MST) of cats with non-taurine responsive dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Thirty-two client-owned cats with a left ventricular internal dimension at end systole (LVIDs) >14 mm, a fractional shortening (FS) <28% and a lack of response to taurine therapy were included over a 9-year period (2001-2010). These cats were divided into pimobendan (n=16) and non-pimobendan (n=16) treatment groups. All cats received standard treatment with frusemide, taurine and benazepril or enalapril. Nine cats in the non-pimobendan group also received digoxin. The MST of the pimobendan group (49 days; range 1 to >502 days) was four times that of the non-pimobendan group (12 days; 1 to 244 days). The difference in survival between the two groups was statistically significant (P = 0.048). Hypothermia and FS <20% were associated with a poor prognosis. No adverse effects to pimobendan were noted.
