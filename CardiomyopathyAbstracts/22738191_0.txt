Aims-Oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction participate together in the development of heart failure. mRNA levels of monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A), a mitochondrial enzyme that produces H2O2, increase in several models of cardiomyopathies. Therefore, we hypothesized that an increase in cardiac MAO-A could cause cardiac oxidative stress and mitochondrial damage, leading to cardiac dysfunction. In the present study, we evaluated the consequences of cardiac MAO-A augmentation on chronic oxidative damage, cardiomyocyte survival and heart function, and identified the intracellular pathways involved. Results-We generated transgenic mice (Tg) with cardiac-specific MAO-A overexpression. Transgenic mice displayed cardiac MAO-A activity levels similar to those found in heart failure and aging. As expected, Tg mice showed a significant decrease in the cardiac amounts of the MAO-A substrates serotonin and noradrenaline. This was associated with enhanced H2O2 generation in situ and mitochondrial DNA oxidation. As a consequence, MAO-A Tg mice demonstrated progressive loss of cardiomyocytes by necrosis and ventricular failure, which were prevented by chronic treatment with the MAO-A inhibitor clorgyline and the anti-oxidant N-acetyl-cystein. Interestingly, Tg hearts exhibited p53 accumulation and down-regulation of PGC-1α, a master regulator of mitochondrial function. This was concomitant with cardiac mitochondrial ultrastructural defects and ATP depletion. In vitro, MAO-A adenovirus transduction of neonatal cardiomyocytes mimicked the results in MAO-A Tg mice, triggering oxidative stress-dependent p53 activation, leading to PGC-1α down-regulation, mitochondrial impairment and cardiomyocyte necrosis. Innovation and conclusion-We provide the first evidence that MAO-A upregulation in the heart causes oxidative mitochondrial damage, p53-dependent repression of PGC-1α cardiomyocyte necrosis and chronic ventricular dysfunction.
