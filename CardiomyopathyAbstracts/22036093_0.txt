We searched for special features in patients with complete and incomplete right bundle branch block diagnosed as having arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy/dysplasia. Whether right bundle branch block is a frequent finding in arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy should be studied. The question is whether special features exist such as T-wave inversions, localized right precordial QRS prolongation and r'/s ratio<1. RESULTS: ARVC could be diagnosed according to ISFC/ESC criteria in 374 patients. CRBBB was found in 22 cases (6%) and iCRBBB was present in 47 cases (12.5%). In CRBBB T wave inversions ≥ V4 was found in 10 cases (n.s.) and r'/s ratio<1 was present in 12 cases (p<0.001). In iCRBBB T wave inversions ≥ V4 was found in 10 cases (n.s.) and ST segment elevation in right precordial leads was present in 19 cases (p<0.005). In all patients with ARVC localized right precordial QRS prolongation was found. Patients with CRBBB have a bad prognosis: 17 of 22 patients developed biventricular heart failure requiring heart transplantation and diuretic therapy. CONCLUSIONS: CRBBB and iCRBBB are infrequent findings in arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy. Complete right bundle branch block is characterized by r'/s ratio<1. There are no significant T wave inversions ≥ V4. Incomplete right bundle branch block is characterized by ST segment elevation in right precordial leads but not by T wave inversions ≥ V4.
