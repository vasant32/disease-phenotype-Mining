Approximately 80-90% of the norepinephrine released in the brain or in peripheral tissues is taken up again through the neuronal norepinephrine transporter (NET). Pharmacological studies with NET inhibitors showed that NET has opposing effects on cardiovascular sympathetic regulation in the brain and in the periphery. Furthermore, NET is involved in the distribution of sympathetic activity between vasculature, heart, and kidney. Genetic NET dysfunction is a rare cause of the postural tachycardia syndrome. The condition is characterized by excessive adrenergic stimulation of the heart, particularly with standing. Conversely, NET inhibition may be beneficial in hypoadrenergic states, such as central autonomic failure, or neurally mediated syncope, which results from acute sympathetic withdrawal. Biochemical studies suggested reduced NET function in some patients with essential hypertension. Furthermore, cardiac NET function appears to be reduced in common heart diseases, such as congestive heart failure, ischemic heart disease, and stress-induced cardiomyopathy. Whether NET dysfunction is a consequence or cause of progressive heart disease in human subjects requires further study. However, studies with the non selective NET inhibitor sibutramine suggest that reduced NET function could have an adverse effect on the cardiovascular system. Given the widespread use of medications inhibiting NET, the issue deserves more attention.
