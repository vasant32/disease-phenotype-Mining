Interventricular septum myocardium was studied in 40 patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Immunohistochemical assay revealed c-kit-positive resident cardiac stem cells in 82.5% patients. The content of the connective tissue and myofibrillar disarray zones and the degree of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and myolysis were determined. In 30% cases, cardiomyocytes containing atrial natriuretic peptide were detected in the interventricular septum myocardium. The data were compared with clinical and functional parameters of patients. It was found that cardiac stem cells are present in patients, whose myocardium was characterized by increased density of the connective tissue, hypertrophy of mature cardiomyocytes, medium degree of myolysis in them, and accumulation of natriuretic peptide, a cardiac failure marker, in cardiomyocytes.
