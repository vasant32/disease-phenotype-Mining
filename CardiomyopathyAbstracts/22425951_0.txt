Previous microRNA (miRNA) array results have shown that the expression of miR-27b is upregulated in heart tissues from human cardiomyopathy and pressure-overloaded hypertrophic mouse model, implying that miR-27b might play an important role in heart diseases. To study the in vivo function of miR-27b, we generated a transgenic mouse line overexpressing miR-27b under the control of the 5.5 kb promoter of a-myosin heavy chain (a-MHC). Real-time PCR results demonstrated that miR-27b precursor and mature miR-27b were significantly increased in the heart tissues of miR-27b transgenic mice. miR-27b transgenic mice not only displayed cardiac hypertrophy, but also exhibited significant cardiac fibrosis. Further study showed that matrix metalloproteinase 13 (MMP13), a key regulator involved in cardiac fibrosis, was the target of miR-27b. The expression of MMP13 was decreased and the expression of Col I and III was increased in miR-27b transgenic mice.. In addition, defects in ultrastructral architecture were also found in miR-27b trans-genic mice. The above results demonstrated that miR-27b might promote cardiac fibrosis through inhibiting MMP13.
