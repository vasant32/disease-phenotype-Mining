Results of the study of special characteristics of the course of chronic heart failure (CHF) in women with periportal cardiomyopathy (PCMP) are presented. We have found that prevalence of PCMP in the structure of dilated cardiomyopathy is 9.5%. PCMP compared with idiopathic cardiomyopathy is characterized by less pronounced dilation of left cardiac chambers, relative preservation of left ventricular contractile function, more favorable course of CHF with lower frequency of destabilizations of clinical state. PCMP has developed mainly during postportal period and in women with preexisting anemia and chronic viral diseases.
