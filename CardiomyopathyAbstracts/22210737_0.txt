The interest and awareness of myocardial infarction with normal coronary arteries (MINCA) have increased recently due to the frequent use of coronary angiography, the description of Takotsubo stress cardiomyopathy, and new sensitive troponin analyses. The prevalence of MINCA in all patients with myocardial infarction (MI) was registered during a 3-month period in the Stockholm metropolitan area in Sweden. The results showed that MINCA is more common than previously thought (7%) and affecting one third of every woman with MI. Patients with myocarditis were younger and more often presented with signs of inflammation such as elevated C-reactive protein and fever. Myocarditis constitutes an important differential diagnosis for coronary artery disease. There is a need for larger studies of MINCA, including investigation with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, to establish prevalence and pathological process in this important subgroup of MI.
