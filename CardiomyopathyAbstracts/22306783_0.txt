Left ventricular noncompaction (LVNC) is a rare cardiomyopathy characterized by deep intertrabecular recesses communicating with the main ventricular chamber. Cardiac magnetic resonance offers high spatial resolution, and thereby substantial aptitude for the diagnosis of LVNC. Additional clinically relevant information, including thrombus and myocardial fibrosis evaluation, can be readily acquired. These images demonstrate classical LVNC morphology in conjunction with its potential sequelae.
