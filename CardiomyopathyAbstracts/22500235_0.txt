Treatment of symptom recurrence after initially successful alcohol septal ablation (ASA) in hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) when accompanied by relapse of intracavitary left ventricular pressure gradient (LVG) is guided by the underlying mechanism. We describe our experience with permanent pacing in three patients with relapse of both LVG and symptoms 7 to 12 months after successful ASA. Even though pressure gradient recurrence was observed at midventricular level, we were able to achieve symptomatic improvement and LVG reduction after right ventricular apex pacing in all three cases. The effect on symptoms was long lasting-the 6-month followup echo-stress tests confirmed good exercise capacity and lack of provocable LVG. We found pacing to be a safe and effective treatment option in this clinical scenario. Based on our overall observations, we propose pacing as a niche treatment for patients with recurrence of LVG at midventricular level after ASA.
