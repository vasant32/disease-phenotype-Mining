Hypocalcemia is a rare but reversible cause of dilated cardiomyopathy with limited cases being reported in the literature. Vitamin D deficiency is the main cause of hypocalcemia in almost all reported cases. We report a newborn presented with hypocalcemia-induced dilated cardiomyopathy secondary to vitamin D deficiency. After calcium and vitamin D therapy, the baby showed a rapid recovery of the cardiac function.
