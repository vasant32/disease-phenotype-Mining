A 57-year-old man presented with near syncope and hemodynamic compromise after exercise. A sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) of right bundle-branch block morphology was evident upon examination at our emergency department. Baseline 12-lead electrocardiography revealed a sinus rhythm with a complete left bundle-branch block after successful cardioversion of the VT. Coronary angiography revealed patent coronary arteries, whereas left ventriculography demonstrated impaired systolic function, accompanied by a peculiar basal lateral aneurysm. Both echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging were consistent with a diagnosis of left-dominant arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy. Four months later, substantial ventricular reverse remodeling and clinical improvements were observed after cardiac resynchronization therapy with a defibrillator, as an adjunct to conventional pharmacological therapy.
