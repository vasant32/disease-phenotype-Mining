Published data on the association between β1-adrenergic receptor gene polymorphisms and idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDCM) risk are inconclusive. To derive a more precise estimation of the relationship, a meta-analysis was performed. A total of 12 case-control studies including 2642 cases and 3136 controls provided data on the association between β1-adrenergic receptor gene polymorphisms and susceptibility to IDCM. Overall, no significantly elevated risk was associated with Arg389Gly polymorphisms for all genetic models. In the subgroup analysis by ethnicity, no statistically increased risk was found for Gly389Gly versus Arg389Arg (OR 0.73; 95% CI 0.54-0.99; Ph=0.35) and Gly389Gly versus Arg389Arg+Arg389Gly (OR 0.75; 95% CI 0.55-1.01; Ph=0.52) among Europeans. Meanwhile, significantly increased risk was found among Asians based on the relatively small sample size. Further, significantly elevated IDCM risk was associated with Ser49Gly polymorphisms for all genetic models. When stratified by ethnicity, statistical association was found among Asians for Gly49Gly versus Ser49Ser (OR 4.56; 95% CI 1.36-15.23; Ph=0.10) and Gly49Gly versus Ser49Ser+Ser49Gly (OR 4.49; 95% CI 1.33-15.15; Ph=0.12), but not among Europeans. In summary, this meta-analysis suggests that no statistically increased risk was found between β1-adrenergic receptor gene polymorphisms and susceptibility to IDCM among Europeans.
