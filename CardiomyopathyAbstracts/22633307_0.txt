 BACKGROUND: Transient changes in the composition of the myocardial extracellular matrix may contribute to the ventricular systolic dysfunction in stress-induced cardiomyopathy (SIC). We examined the changes in plasma matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) that occur early after the clinical presentation of SIC. METHODS AND RESULTS: Ten patients with SIC were enrolled. Plasma concentrations of the 6 major MMPs (1, 2, 3, 7, 8, and 9) and all 4 TIMPs (1, 2, 3, and 4) were analyzed and compared with data from 15 control subjects. Within 24 hours of the clinical presentation, SIC patients had lower MMP-1 levels (0.41 ± 0.13 vs 0.70 ± 0.13 pg/mL; P = .048) and MMP-8 levels (1.61 ± 0.34 vs 4.84 ± 1.38 pg/mL; P = .001) and higher TIMP-4 levels (3.06 ± 0.40 vs 2.16 ± 0.18 pg/mL; P = .05) compared with control. Seven of 9 SIC patients had elevated LV end-diastolic pressures, and all had normal LV end-diastolic dimensions and volumes. CONCLUSIONS: Patients afflicted with SIC had MMP and TIMP profiles similar to those described in hypertensive heart disease and diastolic heart failure and different from the profiles following myocardial infarction. Our findings uncovered a unique biomolecular profile in SIC during the first 24 hours of presentation.
