AIMS: Dilated cardiomyopathies from chronic ischemia (ISCM) or idiopathic (IDCM) pathological mechanisms accompany similar clinical symptoms but may differ in protein expression, cell metabolism, and signaling processes at the cellular level. Using a combination of proteomic and metabolomic profiling, we sought to decipher the relationships between the metabolism and cellular signaling pathways in human heart tissues collected from patients with ISCM, IDCM, and those without heart disease and dilation.Methods and ResultsThe comparative analysis suggested a decrease in glycolysis, Krebs cycle and malate-aspartate shuttle activities in both types of cardiomyopathy and an increase in ketone body oxidation only in ISCM. Chronic ischemic injury was associated with increased DJ-1 and decreased phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) protein expression. The reduced PTEN expression was accompanied by increased phosphorylation of cell-protective AKT. Phosphorylation at T845 of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase proteins, with no change in the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2), was also observed. The downregulation of peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase (PIN1) and NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO) potentially inhibits NF-κB-initiated processes. CONCLUSIONS: The present study characterized differences in the molecular mechanisms, metabolism, and pathologic cell signaling associated with ISCM and IDCM, which may provide novel targets for intervention at the cellular level.
