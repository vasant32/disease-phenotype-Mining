Parvovirus B19 is a frequent virus detected in endomyocardial biopsies of patients with clinically suspected myocarditis or dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Viruses often cause a more symptomatic disease with increased tissue injury if they become reactivated. A disease-specific differential expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) has been described in the regulation of replicating viruses. Analyzing patients with latent and reactivated B19V infection, we found 29 differentially regulated miRNAs and, in order to test whether predicted genes are differentially expressed, selected mRNAs were tested by TaqMan-QPCR.
