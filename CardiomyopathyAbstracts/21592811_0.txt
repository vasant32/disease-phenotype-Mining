 OBJECTIVE: The treatment of severe biventricular (BV) contractile failure using mechanical circulatory support is challenging. We analyzed our center's results following implantation of a biventricular assist device (BVAD). METHODS: We implanted 39 BVADs between September 2001 and January 2009. All patients were qualified candidates for heart transplantation, without an organ available at time of BVAD implantation. Fifteen patients without a history of chronic cardiomyopathy suffered from acute BV failure (group 1), whereas the other 24 suffered from severe chronic cardiomyopathy (group 2). The indication for BVAD implantation was determined in reference to echocardiography, the degree of end-organ damage, and whether the patient qualified for a heart transplant or was a candidate for bridge to recovery. RESULTS: Both groups were similar regarding their preoperative hemodynamics, intraoperative and early postoperative findings, and adverse events. Patients in group 1 were younger (mean age 37±17 years) than those in group 2 (51±12 years). Mean duration of support in group 1 was 137±109 days, and 65±61 days in group 2. In group 1, 33% (5/15) were weaned off the device and 53% (8/15) underwent heart transplantation, whereas 8/24 patients (42%) in the chronic group were transplanted. Group 1's mortality on the device was lower than that of group 2 (13% vs 67%). Furthermore, 11 patients of group 1 survived for 1 year compared with four in group 2 (73% vs 17%). CONCLUSION: Implantation of a BVAD in patients with chronic heart failure and acute decompensation is associated with a high mortality and morbidity rate. By contrast, BVAD implantation can achieve excellent results in patients with acute BV failure without a history of chronic cardiomyopathy, even if they are in cardiogenic shock upon admission.
