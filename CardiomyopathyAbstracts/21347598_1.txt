Our objective was to evaluate the ability of CMR to visualize myocardial injuries over the course of myocarditis. We studied 42 patients (39 males, 3 females; age 37 ± 14 years) with myocarditis during the acute phase and after 12 ± 9 months. CMR included function analyses, T2-weighted imaging (T2 ratio), T1-weighted imaging before and after i.v. gadolinium injection (global relative enhancement; gRE), and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE). In the acute phase, the T2 ratio was elevated in 57%, gRE in 31%, and LGE was present in 64% of the patients. In 32 patients (76%) were any two (or more) out of three sequences abnormal. At follow-up, there was an increase in ejection fraction (57.4 ± 11.9% vs. 61.4 ± 7.6; P < 0.05) while both T2 ratio (2.04 ± 0.32 vs. 1.70 ± 0.28; P < 0.001) and gRE (4.07 ± 1.63 vs. 3.11 ± 1.22; P < 0.05) significantly decreased. The LGE persisted in 10 patients. Dilated cardiomyopathy was present in 3 patients and 4 patients received a defibrillator or a pacemaker. A comprehensive CMR approach is a useful tool to visualize myocardial tissue injuries over the course of myocarditis. CMR may help to differentiate acute from healed myocarditis, and add information for the differential diagnoses.
