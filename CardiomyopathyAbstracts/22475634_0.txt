 BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular complication is one of the most important issues causing morbidity and death in diabetic patients. Primary prevention is a key to prevent this complication. AIMS: The objective was to study the situations of diabetes and cardiovascular risk factor controls in Thai type 2 diabetic patients who had no history of cardiovascular complication at a university hospital in Thailand after the Thai diabetes management guideline was recently launched. METHODS: The study was a cross-sectional survey in type 2 diabetes patients with no history of cardiovascular disease. Seven hundred and fourteen patients were enrolled in the study and 54.3% were females. The data were collected retrospectively from out-patient medical records and an electronic data base for the patients who were followed up at the hospital during January-December 2010. The most recent laboratory values were utilized in the analysis. RESULTS: 70%-90% of all patients were checked for HbA1c and lipid profiles (LDL-C, total cholesterol, triglycerides) at least once a year. It was observed that only 28% of the patients had HbA1c<6.5%. Furthermore, the percentages of the patients who had blood pressure <130/80 mmHg, and who had LDL-C<100 mg/dL were 28% and 41%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Even though the practice guideline has been launched since 2008, diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidemia were still poorly controlled. Further study is recommended to identify factors influencing these outcomes as well as the policy of diabetic care in Thailand is needed to be seriously implemented.
