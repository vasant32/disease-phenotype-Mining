Background: Diabetic nephropathy is the leading cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Myocardial dysfunction may occur in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) in the absence of coronary artery disease or left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy. Although tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) is a highly effective means of quantifying myocardial diastolic function, its differences in ESRD patients with diabetes and without diabetes remain unclear. Methods and Results: A total of 101 ESRD patients on maintenance hemodialysis with normal LV systolic function were studied: 37 with type 2 DM and 64 without DM. Conventional echocardiography and TDI were performed to evaluate LV systolic and diastolic functions. The conventional LV systolic and diastolic echocardiographic parameters did not differ according to presence of DM, except for the left atrial size and volume index (P<0.001). The ESRD patients with DM, however, had significantly decreased mitral annular early diastolic peak velocity (e') and ratio of early to late diastolic mitral annular velocity (e'/a'; both P<0.02). Additionally, the group with DM had markedly higher estimated LV end-diastolic filling pressure (E/e'; P=0.011). Conclusions: ESRD patients with DM had advanced LV diastolic dysfunction on TDI. In ESRD patients with DM, diabetic cardiomyopathy associated with advanced LV diastolic dysfunction is observed.  (Circ J 2012; 76: 2380-2385).
