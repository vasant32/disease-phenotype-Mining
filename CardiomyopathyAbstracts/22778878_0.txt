 AIM: To evaluate safety and utility of coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) compared to invasive coronary angiography (ICA) in new cardiomyopathy. METHODS: Eighteen patients (mean age 56.5 years, 10 males) who presented for evaluation of new onset heart failure with evidence of systolic dysfunction (ejection fraction < 40%) on echocardiography and recent ICA were prospectively enrolled. Patients with known coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, creatinine > 1.5 g/dL, and contraindication to intravenous contrast administration were excluded. CCTA was performed using a dual source 64-slice scanner. Mean heart rate was 75 beats per minute. Stenosis was graded for each coronary segment as: none, mild (< 50%), moderate (50%-70%), severe (> 70%), or non-evaluable. Ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM) was diagnosed if severe stenosis was present in the left main, proximal left anterior descending artery, or two or more major arteries. RESULTS: Two patients were diagnosed with ICM by ICA. CCTA correctly identified 2 patients with ICM and 16 patients as non-ICM. CCTA successfully evaluated 240/246 coronary segments with an accuracy of 97.5%, sensitivity 70%, specificity 98.7%, positive predictive value of 70%, and negative predictive value of 98.7% for identifying severe stenosis on a per-segment level. CONCLUSION: Dual source 64-slice multi-detector CCTA is a safe, accurate, and non-invasive technique for diagnosing ICM in patients presenting during the acute phase of newly diagnosed cardiomyopathy.
