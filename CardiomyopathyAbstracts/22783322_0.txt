Transient stress-induced cardiomyopathies have been increasingly recognized and while rare, they tend to affect elderly women more than other demographic groups. One type, often called tako-tsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC), is typically triggered by significant emotional or physical stress and is associated with chest pain, electrocardiogram (ECG) changes and abnormal cardiac enzymes. Significant left ventricular regional wall motion abnormalities usually include an akinetic "ballooning" apex with normal or hyperdynamic function of the base. A second type, often called neurogenic stunned myocardium, typically associated with subarachnoid hemorrhage, also usually presents with ECG changes and positive enzymes, but the typical wall motion abnormalities seen include normal basal and apical left ventricular contraction with akinesis of the mid-cavity in a circumferential fashion. The pathophysiology, clinical care and typical courses, are reviewed.
