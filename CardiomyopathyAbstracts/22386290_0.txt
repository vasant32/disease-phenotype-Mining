Rigorous training remodels the heart of elite endurance athletes to produce the phenotype of the "athlete's heart." This remodeling, which advantages cardiac performance, creates challenges in the diagnosis of cardiac disorders within this population. This is particularly so for right ventricular pathologies because of the limited number of studies documenting the impact of training on right ventricular remodeling. Although arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy is the focus of this review, several other pathologies that may mimic arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, including right ventricular outflow tract tachycardia, Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, Brugada syndrome, pulmonary embolism, cardiac sarcoidosis, myocarditis, and right ventricular infarction, are also included. In particular, the electrocardiographic findings for each condition are highlighted because this is the most informative and easily accessible diagnostic clinical tool.
