Pelvic arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are uncommon entities that can present with symptoms resulting from compression of adjacent structures, ischemia due to 'steal phenomenon' or, rarely, heart failure. We present a case of heart failure in a patient who presented to our facilities for heart transplant and a prior diagnosis of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy; further evaluation revealed a massive pelvic AVM as causative for the heart failure. This case emphasizes the importance of a thorough physical examination to guide appropriate diagnostic testing.
