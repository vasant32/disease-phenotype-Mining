Tako-tsubo cardiomyopathy is a relatively recently recognized clinical entity, which presents similar to an acute myocardial infarction but there is no evidence of obstructive coronary artery disease on cardiac catheterization. It mostly affects postmenopausal women and an episode of acute illness or stress can often be identified preceding the presentation. Tako-tsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM) usually has a favorable outcome and an excellent prognosis but, in rare instances, it can be associated with life threatening complications. We report a unique case of TCM where the patient presented with a transient complete heart block.
