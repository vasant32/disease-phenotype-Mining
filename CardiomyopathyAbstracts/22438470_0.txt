Extracellular heat shock proteins (eHsps) in the circulation have recently been found to activate both apoptotic and protective signaling in the heart. However, the role of eHsps in doxorubicin (Dox)-induced heart failure has not yet been studied. The objective of the present study was to determine how Dox affects circulating eHsp25 in blood plasma and how eHsp25 affects Dox-induced dilated cardiomyopathy. Wild-type mice [HSF-1(+/+)] were pretreated with 100 μl of heterozygous heat shock factor-1 [HSF-1(+/-)] mouse plasma (which contained 4-fold higher eHsp25 compared with wild-type mice), HSF-1(+/+) plasma, or saline, before treatment with Dox (6 mg/kg). After 4 weeks of this treatment protocol, HSF-1(+/-) plasma-pretreated mice showed increased eHsp25 in plasma and improved cardiac function (percentage of fractional shortening 37.3 ± 2.1 versus 26.4 ± 4.0) and better life span (31 ± 2 versus 22 ± 3 days) compared with the HSF-1(+/+) plasma or saline-pretreated mice. Preincubation of isolated adult cardiomyocytes with HSF-1(+/-) plasma or recombinant human Hsp27 (rhHsp27) significantly reduced Dox-induced activation of nuclear factor-κB and cytokine release and delayed cardiomyocyte death. Moreover, when cardiomyocytes were incubated with fluorescence-tagged rhHsp27, a saturation in binding was observed, suggesting that eHsp25 can bind to surface receptors. Competitive assays with a Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) antibody reduced the rhHSP27 binding, indicating that Hsp25 interacts with TLR2. In conclusion, transfusion of Hsp25-enriched blood plasma protected the heart from Dox-induced cardiotoxicity. Hsp25 antagonized Dox binding to the TLR2 receptor on cardiomyocytes.
