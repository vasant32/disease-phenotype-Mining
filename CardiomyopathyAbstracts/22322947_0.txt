Diabetes mellitus is one of the most common chronic diseases across the world. Cardiovascular complication is the major morbidity and mortality among the diabetic patients. Diabetic cardiomyopathy, a new entity independent of coronary artery disease or hypertension, has been increasingly recognized by clinicians and epidemiologists. Cardiac dysfunction is the major characteristic of diabetic cardiomyopathy. For a better understanding of diabetic cardiomyopathy and necessary treatment strategy, several pathological mechanisms such as impaired calcium handling and increased oxidative stress, have been proposed through clinical and experimental observations. In this review, we will discuss the development of cardiac dysfunction, the mechanisms underlying diabetic cardiomyopathy, diagnostic methods, and treatment options.
