An 81-year-old man had a history of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy induced by general fatigue after travel and acute gastritis 2 years previously. Recently, dyspnea on effort had been worsening. Since preoperative echocardiography showed severe aortic valve regurgitation (AR) with left ventricular (LV) dilatation, aortic valve replacement (AVR) by the standard procedure was indicated. Since the safety of the perioperative clinical course including recurrence of Takotsubo syndrome and hemodynamic compromise was unclear, a thorough examination was performed before surgical intervention. AVR with a 21 mm Mosaic bioprosthesis was performed. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) during operation did not demonstrate any sign of Takotsubo syndrome and good LV function was maintained. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 18 without any cardiac events including arrhythmia or clinical symptoms such as chest pain. Based on these results, open heart surgery under cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and cardiac arrest could be safely performed in patients with a history of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy with minimum use of cardiac agents including cathecholamine and sufficient perioperative removal of emotional and physical stress.
