The most common causes of heart failure in dogs are valvular disease, predominantly endocardiosis, and myocardial disease, predominantly dilated cardiomyopathy. They are related to changes in the expression of several genes in the heart muscle and in peripheral blood nuclear cells which could be considered as prognostic or diagnostic markers of heart disease in dogs. Since many human genetic markers of heart failure have turned out to be useless in dogs, the screening for genomic markers of canine heart failure could give more insight into the molecular pathology of these diseases and aid the development of new treatment strategies.
