 BACKGROUND: Treatment options for patients with recurrent ventricular arrhythmias refractory to pharmacotherapy and ablation are minimal. Although left cardiac sympathetic denervation (LCSD) is well established in long-QT syndrome, its role in non-long-QT syndrome arrhythmogenic channelopathies and cardiomyopathies is less clear. Here, we report our single-center experience in performing LCSD in this setting. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this institutional review board-approved study, we retrospectively reviewed the electronic medical records of all patients (N=91) who had videoscopic LCSD at our institution from 2005 to 2011. Data were analyzed for the subset (n=27) who were denervated for an underlying diagnosis other than autosomal dominant or sporadic long-QT syndrome. The spectrum of arrhythmogenic disease included catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (n=13), Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome (n=5), idiopathic ventricular fibrillation (n=4), left ventricular noncompaction (n=2), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (n=1), ischemic cardiomyopathy (n=1), and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (n=1). Five patients had LCSD because of high-risk assessment and β-blocker intolerance, none of whom had a sentinel breakthrough cardiac event at early follow-up. Among the remaining 22 previously symptomatic patients who had LCSD as secondary prevention, all had an attenuation in cardiac events, with 18 having no breakthrough cardiac events so far and 4 having experienced ≥1 post-LCSD breakthrough cardiac event. CONCLUSIONS: LCSD may represent a substrate-independent antifibrillatory treatment option for patients with life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia syndromes other than long-QT syndrome. The early follow-up seems promising, with a marked reduction in the frequency of cardiac events postdenervation.
