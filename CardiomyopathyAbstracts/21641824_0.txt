A 69-year-old female patient presented heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and atrial fibrillation. Echocardiography and late gadolinium enhancement magnetic resonance imaging were suggestive of endomyocardial fibrosis (EMF). The patient underwent cardiac surgery, and after surgery, she developed low cardiac output syndrome and died. Postmortem examination revealed residual fibrosis of the left ventricle (LV), mild endocardial fibrous deposition of the right ventricle, and severe concentric, symmetrical LV hypertrophy. Histological examination of the surgically resected material from the LV confirmed EMF. Histopathology of the interventricular septum disclosed myocardial hypertrophy and disarray plus fine interstitial fibrosis, typical of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The present case illustrates the association of two different patterns of cardiomyopathies in the same patient.
