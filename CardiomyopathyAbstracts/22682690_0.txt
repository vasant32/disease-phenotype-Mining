Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is a reversible form of left ventricular dysfunction with an apparently benign natural history after left ventricular recovery. Rarely there are complications such as arrhythmias and apical thrombus. We describe a case of takotsubo cardiomyopathy complicated with apical thrombus and persistent complete atrioventricular block after improvement of left ventricular wall motion.
