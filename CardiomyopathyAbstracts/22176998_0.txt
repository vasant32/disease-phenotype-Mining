To assess the proportion and long-term outcomes of patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and potential indications for implantable cardioverter-defibrillator before and after optimization of medical treatment, 503 consecutive patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy were evaluated from 1988 to 2006. A total of 245 patients (49%) satisfied the "Sudden Cardiac Death in Heart Failure Trial (SCD-HeFT) criteria," defined as a left ventricular ejection fraction of ≤0.35 and New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II-III on registration. Among these, 162 (group A) were re-evaluated 5.4 ± 2 months later with concurrent β-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor use. Of the 162 patients, 50 (31%) still had "SCD-HeFT criteria" (group A1), 109 (67%) had an improved left ventricular ejection fraction and/or New York Heart Association class (group A2), and 3 (2%) were in NYHA class IV. Of the 227 patients without baseline "SCD-HeFT criteria" (left ventricular ejection fraction >0.35 or NYHA class I), 125 were evaluated after 5.5 ± 2 months. Of these 227 patients, 13 (10%) developed "SCD-HeFT criteria" (group B1), 111 (89%) remained without "SCD-HeFT criteria" (group B2), and 1 (1%) had worsened to NYHA class IV. The 10-year mortality/heart transplantation and sudden death/sustained ventricular arrhythmia rate was 57% and 37% in group A1, 23% and 20% in group A2 (p <0.001 for mortality/heart transplantation and p = 0.014 for sudden death/sustained ventricular arrhythmia vs group A1), 45% and 41% in group B1 (p = NS vs group A1), 16% and 14% in group B2 (p = NS vs group A2), respectively. In conclusion, two thirds of patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and "SCD-HeFT criteria" at presentation did not maintain implantable cardioverter-defibrillator indications 3 to 9 months later with optimal medical therapy. Their long-term outcome was excellent, similar to that observed for patients who had never met the "SCD-HeFT criteria."
