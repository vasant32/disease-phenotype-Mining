Cardiac myxoma represents the most common primary cardiac neoplasm, accounting for nearly 75% of benign cardiac tumor. Tumor embolisms occur in 30% to 40% of patients with myxoma, and half of these are cerebral arteries. To our knowledge, this is the first published report of multiregional tumor embolizations except for cerebral artery and Takotsubo cardiomyopathy in patients with left atrial myxoma.
