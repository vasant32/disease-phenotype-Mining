Imaging of the right ventricle (RV) for the diagnosis of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy/dysplasia (ARVC/D) is commonly performed by echocardiography or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Angiography is an alternative modality, particularly when MRI cannot be performed. We hypothesized that RV volume and ejection fraction computed by angiography would correlate with these quantities as computed by MRI. RV volumes and ejection fraction were computed for subjects enrolled in the North American ARVC/D Registry, with both RV angiography and MRI studies. Angiography was performed in the 30° right anterior oblique (RAO) and 60° left anterior oblique (LAO) views. Angiographic volumes were computed by RAO view and two-view (RAO and LAO) formulae. 17 subjects were analyzed (11 men and 6 women), with 15 subjects classified as affected, and two as unaffected by modified Task Force criteria. The correlation coefficient of MRI to the two-view angiographic analysis was 0.72 (P = 0.003) for end-diastolic volume and 0.68 (P = 0.005) for ejection fraction. Angiographically derived volumes were larger than MRI derived volume (P = 0.009) and with the slope in a linear relationship equal to 0.8 for end diastolic volume, and 0.9 for RV ejection fraction (P < 0.001), computed by the two view formula. End-diastolic volumes and ejection fractions of the RV obtained by dual view angiography correlate with these quantities by MRI. RV end-diastolic volumes are larger by RV angiography in comparison with MRI.
