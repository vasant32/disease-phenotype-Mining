 BACKGROUND: Heart transplantation is the ultimate treatment for end-stage heart failure. Cardiac sarcoidosis has rarely been reported in heart transplantation worldwide. Their long-term prognosis after heart transplantation is unknown. Herein we have presented clinical and pathological observations among heart transplantation patients with isolated cardiac sarcoidosis. METHODS: From 1987 to 2011, we performed 411 heart transplantations including five patients retrospectively reviewed due to the presence of sarcoidosis and giant-cell cardiomyopathy in the recipient heart. RESULTS: Among the heart transplantations from 2003 to 2011, the four male and one female patients were ages 31 to 40 years. None of them had extra-cardiac sarcoidosis. All five subjects presented with dilated cardiomyopathy with patent coronary arteries. The commonest clinical presentations were atrioventricular block, ventricular arrhythmia, electrocardiographic findings of ST elevations, and poor left ventricular ejection fractions (17%-23%). All patients survived without allograft heart failure to date with the longest survivor at 8 years postoperatively. No recurrence of sarcoidosis has been observed clinically or among the post-heart transplantation endomyocardial biopsies. CONCLUSION: Heart transplantation is a useful treatment for isolated cardiac sarcoidosis patients suffering end-stage heart failure. Often the diagnosis is difficult to establish before heart transplantation despite endomyocardial biopsy. No recurrence of sarcoidosis was observed among the allografted hearts.
