It is believed that cardiac remodeling due to geometric and structural changes is a major mechanism for the progression of heart failure in different pathologies including hypertension, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy, diabetic cardiomyopathy, and myocardial infarction. Increases in the activities of proteolytic enzymes such as matrix metalloproteinases, calpains, cathepsins, and caspases contribute to the process of cardiac remodeling. In addition to modifying the extracellular matrix, both matrix metalloproteinases and cathepsins have been shown to affect the activities of subcellular organelles in cardiomyocytes. The activation of calpains and caspases has been identified to induce subcellular remodeling in failing hearts. Proteolytic activities associated with different proteins including caspases, calpain, and the ubiquitin-proteasome system have been shown to be involved in cardiomyocyte apoptosis, which is an integral part of cardiac remodeling. This article discusses and compares how the activities of various proteases are involved in different cardiac abnormalities with respect to alterations in apoptotic pathways, cardiac remodeling, and cardiac dysfunction. An imbalance appears to occur between the activities of some proteases and their endogenous inhibitors in various types of hypertrophied and failing hearts, and this is likely to further accentuate subcellular remodeling and cardiac dysfunction. The importance of inhibiting the activities of both extracellular and intracellular proteases specific to distinct etiologies, in attenuating cardiac remodeling and apoptosis as well as biochemical changes of subcellular organelles, in heart failure has been emphasized. It is suggested that combination therapy to inhibit different proteases may prove useful for the treatment of heart failure.
