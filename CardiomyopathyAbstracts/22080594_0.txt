 AIMS: Parathyroid hormone (PTH) administration after myocardial infarction (MI) is known to attenuate ischaemic cardiomyopathy. This effect mainly resulted from an increase in mobilization and homing of CD34+/CD45+ cells into the ischaemic myocardium. PTH-related stem cell mobilization was shown to be related to endogenous granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) release. The aim of our study is to determine the role of G-CSF on the cardioprotective effects of PTH. METHODS AND RESULTS: G-CSF +/+ (C57BL/6) and G-CSF -/- mice were treated with PTH for 6 days after inducing a MI. The myocardial homing factor stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) was analysed on day 2 with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Stem cell populations in peripheral blood and hearts were examined by FACS on days 6 and 2, respectively. Cardiac function and immunohistochemistry were investigated on day 6 and day 30. PTH treatment resulted in a significant increase in CD45+/CD34+ cells in peripheral blood in G-CSF +/+ but not in G-CSF -/- mice. However, a significant increase in SDF-1 and enhanced migration of CD45+/CD34+ cells into the ischaemic myocardium was revealed after PTH administration in both G-CSF +/+ and G-CSF -/- mice. Enhanced stem cell homing was associated with improved cardiac function and post-MI survival after PTH treatment. Furthermore, infarct size, wall thickness, and neovascularization showed a significant improvement in both groups 30 days after MI. CONCLUSION: The cardioprotective effects of PTH were shown to be independent of endogenous G-CSF release and therefore from stem cell mobilization. This puts more emphasis on the role of stem cell homing into ischaemic myocardium.
