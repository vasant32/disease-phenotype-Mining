 BACKGROUND: This study was intended to investigate whether cerebral blood flow (CBF) could predict the recovery of left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCMP). METHODS AND RESULTS: Between July 2001 and March 2009, 107 patients who had been diagnosed with idiopathic DCMP underwent radionuclide angiography to assess their CBF. The recovery of LV systolic dysfunction was defined as recovery of the ejection fraction (EF) measured by transthoracic echocardiography to a level of 40% or greater and an increase of 10% or greater in its absolute value during follow-up. The EF was followed for at least 36 months if it did not recover. Thirty-four patients (31.8%) recovered and had greater CBF than the nonrecovered patients (41.9 ± 3.4 vs. 37.1 ± 4.9 mL/min/100g, P < .001). On multivariate logistic analysis, CBF (odds ratio 1.216) and symptom duration (odds ratio 0.952) were independent predictors of the recovery of LV systolic dysfunction. There was also a weak negative correlation between CBF and symptom duration (r = -0.334, P < .001). Furthermore, CBF was associated with LVEF improvement seen at the 1- and 2-year follow-up times according to multiple linear regression analysis. CONCLUSIONS: CBF was associated with recovery of LV systolic dysfunction in patients with idiopathic DCMP. Therefore, measurement of CBF would be helpful to predict the clinical course of their disease.
