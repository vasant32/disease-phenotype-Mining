 BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to describe the prevalence of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC), age-gender interaction, and various comorbidities associated with it based on nationwide hospitalization records. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is an increasingly reported clinical syndrome; however, there are no data on its prevalence in the general US population. METHODS: The Nationwide Inpatient Sample discharge records were queried for the year 2008 using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, code 429.83. RESULTS: There were 6,837 patients diagnosed with TTC among 33,506,402 hospitalizations in the Nationwide Inpatient Sample database. Women were found to have higher odds of developing TTC (odds ratio 8.8). Women >55 years old had 4.8 times higher odds for developing TTC when compared with women <55 years old. Smoking, alcohol abuse, anxiety states, and hyperlipidemia were commonly associated with TTC. The peak incidence of hospitalization for TTC was in summer. CONCLUSION: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy was diagnosed in about 0.02% of all hospitalizations in the United States, mostly in elderly women with history of smoking, alcohol abuse, anxiety states, and hyperlipidemia.
