Viral myocarditis is a life-threatening disease characterized by severe cardiac inflammation that can result in heart failure or sudden cardiac death in previously healthy adults. In a subset of patients, it may result in the development of dilated cardiomyopathy due to the chronic inflammatory process. Despite its clinical need, specific treatments for myocarditis are currently not available. The extracellular matrix (ECM) under normal conditions, functions to maintain the mechanical and structural integrity of the heart but can adapt under pathological circumstances to preserve cardiac function. Recent studies have revealed a crucial role of the ECM in the reparative process after cardiac insult, not only as a key component in cardiac remodeling but also as a regulator of the inflammatory process. Increasing our understanding of the impact the ECM has in the disease pathogenesis and progression of viral myocarditis, might lead to much needed therapeutic interventions. In this review we will describe the pathology of viral myocarditis and illustrate the interplay between inflammation and the ECM in general terms, and during viral myocarditis.
