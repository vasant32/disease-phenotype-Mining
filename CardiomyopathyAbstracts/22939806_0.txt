 OBJECTIVE: Assessment of plasma matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and Doppler markers of increased left ventricular (LV) filling pressure may be added to risk stratify patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy (IC). Therefore, we aimed at investigating the value of plasma MMP-9 and restrictive filling pattern (RFP) in IC patients. METHODS: Eighty-eight consecutive patients hospitalized for heart failure (LV ejection fraction≤40%) due to IC were enrolled. A complete M-mode and two-dimensional echo-Doppler examination were performed. Patients were defined as having RFP if they had a mitral E wave deceleration time<150ms. Plasma MMP-9 and N-terminal protype-B natriuretic peptide levels were assessed at the time of the index echocardiogram. The end point was all-cause mortality or hospitalization for worsening HF. Follow-up period was 25±17months. RESULTS: Median value of MMP-9 was 714ng/ml. On univariate analysis, a number of measurements predicted the composite end point: NYHA class>2, RFP, MMP-9>60.5ng/ml, LV ejection fraction<27%, anemia, pulmonary pressure≥35mmHg, N-terminal protype-B natriuretic peptide>1742pg/ml, and glomerular filtration rate<60ml/min/1.73m(2). Independent variables of outcome were anemia (HR=1.9, p=0.031), and the combination of plasma MMP-9 and RFP (HR=3.2, p=0.004). On Kaplan-Meier survival curves, patients with elevated MMP-9 levels and RFP had the lowest event-free survival rate (log-rank: 29.0, p<0.0001). The net reclassification improvement showed a significant increase in the prediction model when elevated MMP-9 and RFP were added to the base model that included clinical, biochemical and echocardiographic parameters (p<0.0001). CONCLUSION: MMP-9 levels and RFP have an incremental predictive value to risk classify IC patients.
