Cellular immunotherapy has been widely accepted as a new powerful modality of cancer treatment. The last 2 decades have seen impressive results in its application against haemato-oncologic malignancies, melanomas and prostate carcinoma. Cellular immunotherapy has since found applicability beyond cancer into autoimmunity and continues to expand in its clinical applicability. The discovery that stem cells have the ability to differentiate into more mature cell types, like neurones and myocardium, has focused research on using exogenous cells to repair damaged tissues. This led to numerous clinical trials using stem cells in myocardial infarction, cardiomyopathy and spinal cord damage. Results have ranged from modest to significant clinical outcomes with continuing debate on the exact process of regeneration achieved. The intertwining between cell therapy and transfusion medicine now includes research on progenitor cells for the production of mature red cells. It is also clear that cell therapy has enabled an improved understanding of the pathogenesis and clinical course of many diseases, while perhaps its role in regenerative medicine is most enticing. However, the critical role of manufacturing in terms of cost, complexity, reproducibility, and regulatory matters remains a central issue in the consideration of whether cell therapy has met all of its promise.
