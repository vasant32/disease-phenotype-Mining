We present a case of takotsubo cardiomyopathy and demonstrate an initial elevation of microcirculatory resistance (IMR) that reduced on follow-up evaluation. This corresponded with improvements in left ventricular function. We postulate that the changes in microvascular resistance reflect favourable left ventricular microvascular remodelling. The measurement of IMR, a novel marker of microcirculatory dysfunction, provides novel insights into the pathophysiology of this condition.
