BACKGROUND: Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) is a rare genetic disorder caused by chronic uncontrolled complement activation. CASE-DIAGNOSIS/TREATMENT: We present a 4-year-old girl with aHUS who had multiple severe clinical manifestations of thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) including acute kidney injury, dilated cardiomyopathy, and cardiorespiratory arrest. She was managed with intensive plasma exchange and hemodialysis, which could not halt the progression of TMA. The initial single dose of eculizumab only temporarily improved the clinical symptoms of TMA. Sustained improvement of renal, hematological, and cardiac values were only achieved upon institution of chronic treatment with eculizumab. During long-term treatment with eculizumab (>2.5Â years), she has had no further clinical manifestations of TMA, and required neither plasma exchange nor hemodialysis. CONCLUSION: Chronic eculizumab treatment was associated with control of complement-mediated TMA and sustained long-term improvement in renal and cardiac function.
