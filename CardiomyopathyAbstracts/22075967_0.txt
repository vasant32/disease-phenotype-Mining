 BACKGROUND: Diabetic cardiomyopathy is characterized by energetic dysregulation caused by glucotoxicity, lipotoxicity, and mitochondrial alterations. p53 and its downstream mitochondrial assembly protein, synthesis of cytochrome c oxidase 2 (SCO2), are important regulators of mitochondrial respiration, whereas the involvement in diabetic cardiomyopathy remains to be determined. METHODS AND RESULTS: The role of p53 and SCO2 in energy metabolism was examined in both type I (streptozotocin [STZ] administration) and type II diabetic (db/db) mice. Cardiac expressions of p53 and SCO2 in 4-week STZ diabetic mice were upregulated (185% and 152% versus controls, respectively, P<0.01), with a marked decrease in cardiac performance. Mitochondrial oxygen consumption was increased (136% versus control, P<0.01) in parallel with augmentation of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV) activity. Reactive oxygen species (ROS)-damaged myocytes and lipid accumulation were increased in association with membrane-localization of fatty acid translocase protein FAT/CD36. Antioxidant tempol reduced the increased expressions of p53 and SCO2 in STZ-diabetic hearts and normalized alterations in mitochondrial oxygen consumption, lipid accumulation, and cardiac dysfunction. Similar results were observed in db/db mice, whereas in p53-deficient or SCO2-deficient diabetic mice, the cardiac and metabolic abnormalities were prevented. Overexpression of SCO2 in cardiac myocytes increased mitochondrial ROS and fatty acid accumulation, whereas knockdown of SCO2 ameliorated them. CONCLUSIONS: Myocardial p53/SCO2 signal is activated by diabetes-mediated ROS generation to increase mitochondrial oxygen consumption, resulting in excessive generation of mitochondria-derived ROS and lipid accumulation in association with cardiac dysfunction.
