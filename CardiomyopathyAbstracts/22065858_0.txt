As the specific composition of lipids is essential for the maintenance of membrane integrity, enzyme function, ion channels, and membrane receptors, an alteration in lipid composition or metabolism may be one of the crucial changes occurring during skeletal and cardiac myopathies. Although the inheritance (autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, and X-linked traits) and underlying/defining mutations causing these myopathies are known, the contribution of lipid homeostasis in the progression of these diseases needs to be established. The purpose of this review is to present the current knowledge relating to lipid changes in inherited skeletal muscle disorders, such as Duchenne/Becker muscular dystrophy, myotonic muscular dystrophy, limb-girdle myopathic dystrophies, desminopathies, rostrocaudal muscular dystrophy, and Dunnigan-type familial lipodystrophy. The lipid modifications in familial hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathies, as well as Barth syndrome and several other cardiac disorders associated with abnormal lipid storage, are discussed. Information on lipid alterations occurring in these myopathies will aid in the design of improved methods of screening and therapy in children and young adults with or without a family history of genetic diseases.
