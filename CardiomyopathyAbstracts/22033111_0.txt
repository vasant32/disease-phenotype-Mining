 INTRODUCTION: Fabry's disease is a X-linked lysosomal storage disorder caused by an alpha-galactosidase A deficiency responsible for the accumulation of glycosphingolipids. Males are more severely and frequently affected than females. We report the case of a female who presented a stroke revealing Fabry's disease. CASE REPORT: An 53-year-old woman, with cardiovascular risk factors and two previous transient ischemic attacks, was admitted with a brutal right hemiparisia. Cerebral MRI showed multiple white matter lesions in the cerebral hemispheres with multiple lacunar infarcts and ectatic vessels, cardiac echography revealed a hypertrophic concentric cardiomyopathy, and slit-lamp examination demonstrated a cornea verticillata. The sequencing of the alpha-galactosidase gene (GLA) revealed the c.150_151del mutation responsible for a loss of function. DISCUSSION: As in the present case, ophthalmological examination is very useful to determine Fabry's disease as a cause of young onset stroke. Females may be affected by X-linked disease, as the Fabry's disease. Fabry's disease among females is mainly characterized by the involvement of the nervous and cardiovascular systems. The specific treatment is based on an enzyme replacement therapy by recombinant enzyme with cardiovascular benefit. Despite the presence of cardiovascular risk factors, this case demonstrates the importance of thorough standardized investigations including ophthalmological examination of young patients with stroke.
