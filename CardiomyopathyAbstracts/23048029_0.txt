Mutations in the lamin A/C gene (LMNA) cause a diverse spectrum of diseases, the most common of which is dilated cardiomyopathy often with skeletal muscular dystrophy. Lamin A and C are fundamental components of the nuclear lamina, a dynamic meshwork of intermediate filaments lining the nuclear envelope inner membrane. Prevailing evidence suggests the nuclear envelope functions as a signaling node and that abnormality in the nuclear lamina lead to dysregulated signaling pathways that underlie disease pathogenesis. We previously showed that activated ERK1/2 in hearts of a mouse model of LMNA cardiomyopathy (LmnaH222P/H222P mice) contributes to disease but the complete molecular pathogenesis remains poorly understood. Here we uncover a pathogenic role of dual specificity phosphatase 4 (Dusp4), which is transcriptionally induced by ERK1/2. Dusp4 is highly expressed in hearts of LmnaH222P/H222P mice and transgenic mice with cardiac-selective overexpression of Dusp4 display heart dysfunction similar to LMNA cardiomyopathy. In both primary tissue and cell culture models, overexpression of Dusp4 positively regulates AKT-mTOR signaling resulting in impaired autophagy. These findings identify a pathogenic role of Dusp4 in LMNA cardiomyopathy.
