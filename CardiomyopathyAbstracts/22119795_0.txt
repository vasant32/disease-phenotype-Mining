Subunit 7a of mouse cytochrome c oxidase (Cox) displays a contractile muscle-specific isoform, Cox7a1, that is the major cardiac form. To gain insight into the role of this isoform, we have produced a new knockout mouse line that lacks Cox7a1. We show that homozygous and heterozygous Cox7a1 knockout mice, although viable, have reduced Cox activity and develop a dilated cardiomyopathy at 6 weeks of age. Surprisingly, the cardiomyopathy improves and stabilizes by 6 months of age. Cox7a1 knockout mice incorporate more of the "liver-type" isoform Cox7a2 into the cardiac Cox holoenzyme and, also surprisingly, have higher tissue ATP levels.
