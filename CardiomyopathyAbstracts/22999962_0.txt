INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: To summarize the findings of the Spanish Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillator Registry for 2011 compiled by the Electrophysiology and Arrhythmia Section of the Spanish Society of Cardiology. METHODS: Each implantation team voluntarily and prospectively recorded data on a data collection form, which was then sent to the Spanish Society of Cardiology. RESULTS: Overall, 4481 device implantations were notified, representing 83.6% of the estimated total number of implantations. The notified implantation rate was 97 per million population and the estimated total implantation rate was 116.2 per million. First implantations accounted for 70.2% of the total notified. Data were collected from 167 hospitals (22 more than in 2010). Most implantable cardioverter-defibrillator implantations took place in men (82.1%). The mean age was 62.4 (14.1) years. Most patients had severe or moderate-to-severe ventricular dysfunction and were in New York Heart Association functional class II. The most frequent underlying cardiac condition was ischemic heart disease, followed by dilated cardiomyopathy. The number of indications for primary prevention increased over the previous year and accounted for 70.6% of first implantations. Overall, 78.4% of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators were implanted by cardiac electrophysiologists. CONCLUSIONS: The 2011 Spanish Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillator Registry includes data on almost 84% of all implantations of these devices performed in Spain. This was the first year in which the number of implants decreased slightly from the previous year, as also occurred in the rest of Europe. The percentage of implants for primary prevention continued to increase. Full English text available from:www.revespcardiol.org.
