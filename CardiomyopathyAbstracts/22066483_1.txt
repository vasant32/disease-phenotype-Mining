Löeffler endocarditis is a rare myocardial disease often due to eosinophil leukemia or idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome. Degranulation of eosinophils within the eosinophil infiltrated myocardium is associated with myocardial necrosis due to the release of toxic cationic proteins, and with mural thrombi formation, which can occur anywhere in the ventricles. Thrombus formed on denuded myocardium is replaced by fibrosis as the final pathological stage of the disease, eventually leading to restrictive cardiomyopathy. We describe a multimodality imaging approach to the diagnosis and follow-up evaluation of Löeffler disease complicated by thrombus formation and neoangiogenesis of LV apex.
