Cardiomyopathy refers to nonspecific myocardial dysfunction that may be due to a variety of causes. Viral illnesses have long been known to cause cardiomyopathy, and the list of viral causes is extensive. Influenza infection is a rare cause of myocarditis. Recent reports, however, indicate that influenza A (H1N1) can cause acute myocarditis and cardiomyopathy in adults and fulminant myocarditis in children as seen during the 2009 global outbreak of the H1N1 influenza virus. The following presents a case series of adult patients with acute reversible cardiomyopathy associated with influenza A (H1N1) infection (see Table 1 for patient characteristics).
