Chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy (CCC) is the main contributor to morbidity and mortality among individuals chronically infected with the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. However, cardiomyopathy develops in fewer than one-third of these patients. Among the different mechanisms to explain this variability are environmental factors, T. cruzi genetic diversity, and host susceptibility. CCC is the culmination of a pathologic process with an onset during the acute infection phase. Previous studies of host genetic factors have been limited to a few candidate genes. This review describes the pathologic features of acute and chronic myocarditis and the host susceptibility factors that may contribute to the development of chagasic cardiomyopathy.
