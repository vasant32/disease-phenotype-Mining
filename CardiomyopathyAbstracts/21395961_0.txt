 BACKGROUND: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TC) is increasingly recognised in patients presenting with features of acute coronary syndrome. We present a single centre experience of TC with medium term follow up. METHODS: Fifty-two consecutive patients presenting with a diagnosis of TC were included. The clinical presentation, complications, baseline and follow-up echocardiograms and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging were analysed. RESULTS: Fifty-one patients were female. A stressful event preceded presentation in 37 (71%) patients. Chest pain was the most common symptom (83%). Two patients presented with an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. ST segment elevation (40%) and global T wave inversion (44%) were the most frequent electrocardiogram changes. Left ventricular assessment demonstrated typical apical ballooning in 41 patients and 11 patients demonstrated the mid-wall variant. In-hospital complications occurred in 11 patients (21%) and included acute pulmonary oedema (n = 2), cardiogenic shock (n = 5); two of whom had a significant left ventricular outflow gradient, atrial fibrillation (n = 1), left ventricular thrombus (n = 2) and a cerebrovascular event (n = 2). Left ventricular function at presentation and follow up was compared in 40 patients. The mean ejection fraction in this group at presentation was 47% (20-70%) compared with that at follow up of 63% (44-76%). There were no significant complications or recurrences at follow up. CONCLUSIONS: While TC is a reversible condition with low rates of complications and recurrence at follow up it is, as demonstrated in our cohort, associated with significant in-hospital morbidity in a proportion of patients.
