Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of premature mortality in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Pathophysiology of rheumatoid cardiovascular phenomenon is not fully understood, but systemic inflammation is thought to play a crucial role in the endothelial damage and accelerated course of atherosclerotic disease. Rheumatoid inflammation can also cause coronary pathology and heart failure. We present a case of transient cardiomyopathy in RA in the absence of occlusive coronary pathology, which mimics acute coronary syndrome.
