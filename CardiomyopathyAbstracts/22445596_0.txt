 BACKGROUND: Speckle tracking echocardiography (STE)-derived mitral annular displacement (MAD) utilizes the speckle tracking technique to measure strain vectors, which provides accurate estimates of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Here, we investigated a link between STE-derived MAD and LVEF in patients with different heart diseases and evaluated its clinical usefulness. METHODS: This study included 266 outpatients and 84 controls. Of the study patients, 52 patients had ischemic heart disease (IHD), 37 patients had dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), 34 patients had hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), 74 patients had valvular heart disease (VHD), and 69 patients had hypertensive heart disease (HHD). STE continuously tracked annular motion throughout the cardiac cycle in the apical 4- and 2-chamber views. RESULTS: In all participants, the curvilinear relationship was found between STE-derived MAD and LVEF (R(2)=0.642). The strong correlation between STE-derived MAD and LVEF was also found in the patients with IHD (R(2)=0.733, p=0.001) and in those with DCM (R(2)=0.614, p=0.008). However, such a correlation was not found in the patients with HCM, VHD, or HHD. CONCLUSION: The specificity in the correlation between STE-derived MAD and LVEF was found in patients with each heart disease, which should be taken into account when assessing these parameters.
