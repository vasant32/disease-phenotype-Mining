Aim Peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) is a rare cause of dilated cardiomyopathy responsible for heart failure toward the end of pregnancy, which can lead to chronic heart failure in 50% of cases. In this short report, we assessed the benefit of cardiac resynchronization in patients with PPCM and chronic systolic dysfunction despite optimal medical treatment.   METHODS AND RESULTS:  For the last 10 years, we managed eight patients diagnosed with PPCM. Two of them presented severe systolic dysfunction, and medical treatment resulted in limited improvement from 10% to 25% and from 25% to 28% despite optimal treatment for 9 and 6 years, respectively. These two patients were porposed to receive an implantatable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) and cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). Six months after ICD-CRT treatment, we observed a significant improvement in systolic function from 25% to 45% and 28% to 50%, respectively, and positive remodelling with reduction of left ventricular end-diastolic volume from 216 to 144 mL and from 354 to 105 mL, which represent a 34% and a 70% reduction, respectively.   CONCLUSIONS:  Physicians in charge of patients with PPCM should offer the opportunity of CRT for patients whose cardiac function has not significantly improved under standard medical treatment.
