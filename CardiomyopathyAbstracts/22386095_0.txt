The goal of this column is to provide a case that is pertinent to the medical transport industry and provides teaching points for crewmembers who are actively involved in out-of-hospital transport, whether by air or by other means. In this issue, we have the opportunity to examine two similar cases from a single crew (nurse/paramedic) that occurred within several months of each other and to describe a moderately rare condition that mimics a common diagnosis encountered by critical care personnel.
