The first two prenatal ultrasound diagnoses of Cardiac ß-Myosin Heavy Chain gene (MYH7) related left ventricular noncompaction cardiomyopathy (LVNC) are presented. MYH7 defects are a major cause of genetic cardiomyopathies, including LVNC in adults and children.(1) LVNC is characterized by a trabecular meshwork and deep intertrabecular myocardial recesses communicating with the left ventricular (LV) cavity. Clinical features range from non-penetrant disease in adult carriers to heart failure, arrhythmia and thromboembolism. Copyright © 2012 ISUOG. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
