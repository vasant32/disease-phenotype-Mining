 BACKGROUND: Heart failure is a serious disease ending with death if untreated. Although heart transplantation is the best therapy for end-stage heart failure, most candidates die in the waiting period due to the lack of donor organs. This condition represent a new era of heart failure surgery. METHODS: We retrospectively investigated 159 patients from 1998 to 2011 with a mean age of 40.0 years (range = 5-65), who were mostly diagnosed as dilated cardiomyopathy (n = 113). After April 2007, 67 patients underwent vascular assist device (VAD) implantation surgery for acute or chronic end-stage heart failure. We performed 69 heart transplantation with 27 on VAD systems before transplantation. RESULTS: Early mortality was 13.3% with 21 patients after the heart transplantation. The 67 patients supported with VAD did not experience an intraoperative death. The mean support time was 214 days (range = 3-1035). Twenty-four patients (35.8%) are still on pump support. The overall survival until transplantation or weaning was 77.6% at mean of 250.7 days survival reached 90% with Heartware (Hartware Inc, Miramar, Fla, USA) continuous flow pumps. CONCLUSION: After the introduction of VAD in 2007, the overall picture has been restructured radically for heart failure surgery, reducing patient loss on the waiting list. Especially, since 2009 nearly 80% of donor hearts were used for patients on mechanical circulatory support.
