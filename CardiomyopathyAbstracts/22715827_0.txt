 BACKGROUND: Chagas' disease is a zoonosis caused by a protozoan agent, Trypanosoma cruzi. Patients undergoing immunosuppressive treatment due to organ transplant, malignancies, infections, or chemotherapy may reactivate a preexisting chronic or indeterminate Trypanosoma cruzi infection. METHODS: We present two transplant patients who underwent reactivation of Chagas' disease with cutaneous manifestations after an augmentation in their immunosuppressive therapy. A 38-year-old man was hospitalized on day 69 after receiving an allogeneic bone marrow transplant; he developed multiple painful erythematous plaques with diffuse borders, confined to the right cheek, trunk, thigh, elbows, and feet. A 59-year-old woman with a 14-year history of Chagasic cardiomyopathy presented one month after heart transplantation with a painful infiltrated purpuric plaque on the back of her right leg. RESULTS: In both cases, histologic examination of skin biopsies showed dermal infiltration with intrahistiocytic amastigotes. In one of the reported cases, the Strout method detected parasitemia. Treatments with nifurtimox (600 mg/d) in case 1 and benznidazole (400 mg/d) in case 2 were started. Fever and cutaneous lesions resolved immediately after seven days of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Reactivation of Chagas' disease is a serious complication that usually occurs in immunocompromised patients. Clinical manifestations include febrile illness occasionally associated with painful skin lesions. Early diagnosis and proper treatment can significantly improve these patients' outcome.
