Non-compaction of the ventricular myocardium is a congenital dysfunction of ventricular morphogenesis caused by the arrest of normal embryogenesis of the ventricles. It is considered as a rare disease and can involve both ventricles but commonly the left ventricle. It is classified into isolated non-compaction of the ventricles and non-compaction associated with other congenital heart defects. Its association with Ebstein's anomaly is very rare. We are reporting a rare case of severe heart failure and complex cardiac anomaly including biventricular non-compaction cardiomyopathy, Ebstein's anomalies and large patent ductus arteriosus with severe persistent pulmonary hypertension in a 31-weeks-old preterm infant. The infant recovered smoothly and continued to be asymptomatic and off medications throughout his 2&emsp14;years follow-up period. Up to our knowledge, this is the youngest and first patient yet reported to have this disease at this age with good recovery.
