Conventional cardiac surgical procedures or transcatheter interventions after orthotopic heart transplantation are generally uncommon. We report the case of a 45-year-old woman who developed severe aortic insufficiency after insertion of a 5-L Impella device 16 weeks after heart transplantation. After joint evaluation by the transcatheter valve team, transcatheter aortic valve implantation was planned because of associated comorbid conditions. A 29-mm CoreValve prosthesis (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN) was inserted percutaneously. At 6 months after prosthesis implantation, the patient was asymptomatic in New York Heart Association functional class II, and the echocardiogram showed a mean transvalvular gradient of 1 mm Hg, an aortic valve area of 1.5 cm2, and no paravalvular aortic insufficiency.
