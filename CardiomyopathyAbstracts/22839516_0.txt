We examined 86 patients with various forms and variants of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Examination of 69 patients with nonobstructive form of the disease included echocardiography. The state of left atrium (LA) was studied by measurement of its systolic and diastolic longitudinal and transversal dimensions with calculation of main parameters of contractility. In 60% of patients with HCM including those with nonobstuctive form we found spherical remodeling of LA with lowering of its contractility. Coefficient of remodeling was suggested as ratio of transversal and longitudinal dimensions of its cavity.
