After 169 days on left ventricular assist device (LVAD) support, a 62-year-old male patient suffering from idiopathic dilatative cardiomyopathy showed signs of left ventricular recovery. Off-pump trials were done, and our explantation criteria were met. The LVAD removal procedure was performed after 338 days on the device, using a left lateral thoracotomy in the sixth intercostal space. First, the outflow graft was transected and the distal end was sewed. Then, the pump was replaced by an individually manufactured titanium plug. Finally, the driveline was cut so that the device could be completely withdrawn. The rest of the driveline was accessed through a small abdominal incision and explanted through the percutaneous exit site.
