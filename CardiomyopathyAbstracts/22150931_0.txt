Narrow QRS tachycardia with atrial activation occurring before ventricular activation was induced in a 34-year-old woman with dilated cardiomyopathy. During tachycardia late ventricular extrastimulus delivered when His bundle was refractory failed to reset the tachycardia while early ventricular extrastimulus caused paradoxical delay of the subsequent atrial response and terminated the tachycardia with a QRS not being followed by an atrial response. This is a rare but specific sign for excluding atrial reentry as the mechanism of tachycardia when P wave or atrial activation is registered before QRS response.
