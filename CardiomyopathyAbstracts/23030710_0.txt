Objective. Case report of a 35-year-old gravida 3, para 2, at 40 + 6 weeks with massive respiratory dysfunction with need of oxygenation, requiring cesarean section. Case Report. Postpartum investigations revealed pathological cardiomegaly with left ventricular failure (NYHAIV). Cardiac biopsy diagnosed postpartum dilatative cardiomyopathy. Despite medication with bromocriptine and levosimendan, cardiac function continued to decrease, requiring surgical intervention and implantation of an intracorporal, left ventricular assist device. Following surgery, cardiac function progressively improved and stabilized. Objective. Peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) is a rare, pregnancy-induced disease and requires an interdisciplinary approach for diagnostics and therapeutical treatment.
