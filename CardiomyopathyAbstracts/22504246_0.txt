Stress-induced cardiomyopathy, a reversible left ventricular dysfunction, has been reported following anaphylaxis; this clinical circumstance seems to be linked to elevated levels of circulating catecholamines. We present a 36-year-old woman diagnosed as stress-induced cardiomyopathy following ceftriaxone-induced anaphylaxis. After anaphylactic reaction, the patient initially presented with cardiogenic shock, and subsequently developed multiple organ failure. She recovered basically by multiple organ supportive therapies including intra-aortic balloon pump and continuous veno-venous hemofiltration. This case provides a unique opportunity to observe the triggering of stress-induced cardiomyopathy, and also it provides evidence to support the role of catecholamine in the pathogenesis of this disease.
