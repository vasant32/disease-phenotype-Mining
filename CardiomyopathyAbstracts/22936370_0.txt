The diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis should be considered in any patient with unexplained right heart failure. The differentiation between constrictive pericarditis and restrictive cardiomyopathy is based on a combination of clinical presentation, history and imaging, and on occasion, on the basis of invasive hemodynamic studies or biopsy. Pertinent anatomic and physiologic findings on cardiac imaging modalities including echocardiography, computed tomography and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging are reviewed, and in many cases the diagnosis can be determined on the basis of imaging. Hemodynamic studies may clarify the diagnosis, and biopsy may find treatable causes of disease.
