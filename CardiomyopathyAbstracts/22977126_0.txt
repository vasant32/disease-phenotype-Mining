BACKGROUND: -Myocardial strain imaging using echocardiography can be a cost-effective method to objectively quantify ventricular wall motion but few studies have compared strain measured with echocardiography against MRI in small animals. METHODS AND RESULTS: -We compared circumferential (CS) and radial strain (RS) measured with echocardiography (vector velocity imaging [VVI]) to displacement encoding with stimulated-echo (DENSE) MRI in two mouse models of cardiomyopathy. In 3 month old mice with gene targeted deficiency of cardiac myosin binding protein-C (cMyBP-C(-/-), n=6) or muscle LIM protein (MLP(-/-), n=6), and wild-type (WT) mice (n=8), myocardial strains were measured at three cross-sectional levels and averaged to obtain global strains. There was modest correlation between VVI and MRI measured strains, with global CS yielding stronger correlation compared to global RS (CS R(2) = 0.4452 vs. RS R(2) = 0.2794, both p<0.05). Overall, strain measured by VVI was more variable than MRI (p<0.05) and the limits of agreement were slightly, but not significantly (p=0.14) closer for global CS than RS. Both VVI and MRI strain measurements showed significantly lower global CS strain in the knockout groups compared to the wild-type. The VVI (but not MRI) CS strain measurements were different between the two knockout groups (-14.5 ± 3.8% vs. -6.6 ± 4.0%, cMyBP-C(-/-) vs. MLP(-/-) respectively, p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: -Measurements of LV circumferential and radial strains are feasible in small animals using 2D echocardiography. VVI and MRI strain measurements correlated modestly and the agreement between the modalities tended to be greater for circumferential than radial strain. Although VVI and MRI strains were able to differentiate between wild-type and knockout mice, only global circumferential VVI strain differentiated between the two models of cardiomyopathy.
