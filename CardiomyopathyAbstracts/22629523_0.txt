Vitiligo in association with autoimmune endocrine disorders, especially with hypothyroidism, is not uncommon. Some amount of pericardial effusion is usually present in long-standing/untreated hypothyroidism. Here we describe the case of young male with, long-standing progressive vitiligo, presenting with congestive cardiac failure due to dilated cardiomyopathy and primary hypothyroidism. Cardiac dysfunction progressively improved with thyroid hormone replacement over a period of 2 years.
