Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) have been developed rapidly in the last decade. Technical improvements and broad availability of modern CT and MRI scanners have led to an increasing and regular use of both diagnostic methods in clinical routine. Therefore, this German consensus document has been developed in collaboration by the German Cardiac Society, German Radiology Society, and the German Society for Pediatric Cardiology. It is not oriented on modalities and methods, but rather on disease entities. This consensus document deals with coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathies, arrhythmias, valvular diseases, pericardial diseases and structural changes, as well as with congenital heart defects. For different clinical scenarios both imaging modalities CT and MRI are compared and evaluated in the specific context.
