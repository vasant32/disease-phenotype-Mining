Secondary hyperparathyroidism is a common complication of chronic kidney disease and it is associated with high morbidity and mortality. It is characterized by high parathyroid hormone levels and bone turnover leading to bone pain, deformity and fragility. Furthermore, secondary hyperparathyroidism adversely affects the cardiovascular system and has been associated with cardiovascular calcification and cardiomyopathy. Cinacalcet, a type II calcimimetic, is an effective and well-tolerated oral therapy for the management of secondary hyperparathyroidism. It is an allosteric activator of the calcium-sensing receptor enhancing sensitivity of parathyroid cells to extracellular calcium, which leads to inhibition of parathyroid hormone secretion. The calcium-sensing receptor expression in cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells raises the possibility that this receptor may be implicated in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular disease and constitute a potential therapeutic target. This article reviews the role of the calcimimetic agent cinacalcet in the prevention and progression of cardiovascular calcification and uremic cardiomyopathy in the chronic kidney disease setting.
