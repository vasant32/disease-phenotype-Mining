Acromegaly has several cardiovascular manifestations of which cardiomyopathy (CMP) and hypertension (HTN) are important and contribute to the increased mortality associated with the disease. Both these manifestations are reversible with treatment. However, very advanced CMP with severe systolic dysfunction has low likelihood of reversal. The reversibility is higher in young population and decreases as age advances. Also, the time required for these manifestations to resolve is about 1 year. Here, we describe a case in which HTN and advanced heart failure resolved in an aged patient within a very short span of 2 months from the time of presentation.
