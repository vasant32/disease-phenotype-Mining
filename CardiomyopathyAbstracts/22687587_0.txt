Treatments for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy are largely selected based on patient symptoms and echocardiographic findings. Moreover, all the advanced treatments for heart failure symptoms depend on such imaging for planning and monitoring response to therapy. Risk of sudden death correlates with maximum left ventricular (LV) wall thickness. Massive LV thickening of 30 mm or more is an indication for primary prevention of sudden death with an implanted defibrillator. In this review, we will underscore potential pitfalls in echocardiographic diagnosis. Also we will review, a newly appreciated pathophysiologic mechanism in obstruction dynamic systolic dysfunction due to gradient.
