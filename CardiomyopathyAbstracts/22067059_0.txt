We present the case of a Caucasian woman who survived two major earthquakes, presenting on each occasion with stress cardiomyopathy, but with a different pattern of regional wall motion abnormality on the second occasion. The first Christchurch earthquake struck on September 4, 2010. At 7.1 on the Richter scale, it was larger than the major Haiti quake, but miraculously there were no direct fatalities. In the week following, eight women meeting modified Mayo criteria for stress cardiomyopathy presented to Christchurch Hospital. The second Christchurch earthquake was on February 22, 2011. It measured 6.4 on the Richter scale and caused 180 direct fatalities. In the week following this earthquake, 24 women were admitted with stress cardiomyopathy. One patient presented after both earthquakes. This 76-year-old woman first presented on September 4 with 10 hours of chest pain. Electrocardiogram showed inferolateral deep T-wave inversion and QT prolongation. TnI peaked at 0.81 μg/L. Coronary angiography demonstrated diffuse atheroma with a moderate mid LAD lesion that was stented at the time. Echocardiography showed a classic takotsubo pattern. Her follow-up echocardiogram on September 28 was normal and she was completely well at that point. However, during the second earthquake of February 22, she again developed chest pain and shortness of breath. TnI peaked at 1.3 μg/L. Echocardiogram showed a midwall variant takotsubo with apical sparing. She was discharged from hospital on the 25th, planning to leave Christchurch for a new home in another city, but returned for follow-up echocardiogram on July 27. This was normal.
