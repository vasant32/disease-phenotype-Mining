An in vitro heart disease model is a promising model used for identifying the genes responsible for the disease, evaluating the effects of drugs, and regenerative medicine. We were interested in disease models using a patient-induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell-derived cardiomyocytes because of their similarity to a patient's tissues. However, as these studies have just begun, we would like to review the literature in this and other related fields and discuss the path for future models of molecular biology that can help to diagnose and cure diseases, and its involvement in regenerative medicine. The heterogeneity of iPS cells and/or differentiated cardiomyocytes has been recognized as a problem. An in vitro heart disease model should be evaluated using molecular biological analyses, such as mRNA and micro-RNA expression profiles and proteomic analysis.
