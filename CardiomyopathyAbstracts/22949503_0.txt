Oxidative stress causes mitochondrial dysfunction and heart failure through unknown mechanism. Cardiolipin (CL), a mitochondrial membrane phospholipid required for oxidative phosphorylation, plays a pivotal role in cardiac function. The onset of age-related heart diseases is characterized by aberrant CL acyl composition that is highly sensitive to oxidative damage, leading to CL peroxidation and mitochondrial dysfunction. Here, we report a key role of ALCAT1, a lysocardiolipin acyltransferase that catalyzes the synthesis of CL with a high peroxidation index, in mitochondrial dysfunction associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. We show that ALCAT1 expression was potently up-regulated by the onset of hyperthyroid cardiomyopathy, leading to oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. Accordingly, overexpression of ALCAT1 in H9c2 cardiac cells caused severe oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation, and mtDNA depletion. Conversely, ablation of ALCAT1 prevented the onset of T4-induced cardiomyopathy and cardiac dysfunction. ALCAT1 deficiency also mitigated oxidative stress, insulin resistance, and mitochondrial dysfunction by improving mitochondrial quality control through up-regulation of PINK1, a mitochondrial GTPase required for mitochondrial autophagy. Together, these findings implicate a key role of ALCAT1 as the missing link between oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in the etiology of age-related heart diseases.
