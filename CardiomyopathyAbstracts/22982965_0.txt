BACKGROUND: Despite modern treatment strategies cardiogenic shock (CS) is still associated with high mortality. OBJECTIVE: This study sought to evaluate the feasibility and safety of temporary percutaneous left ventricular (LV) stimulation as rescue therapy in patients with CS refractory to standard clinical care. METHODS: Consecutive patients with deteriorating CS without further treatment options received transjugular placement of a temporary LV lead if they exhibited signs of asynchronous LV contraction. To maintain atrioventricular synchronous contraction an additional right atrial lead was placed in patients with sinus rhythm. The leads were externally connected to a conventional pacemaker. Hemodynamic course, clinical outcome and adverse events were assessed. RESULTS: A total of 15 patients [ischemic cardiomyopathy (n=8), dilated cardiomyopathy (n=6), acute myocarditis (n=1)] underwent successful lead placement. Median procedure and fluoroscopy times measured 60min (interquartile range 55;90) and 12min (IQR 7;34), respectively. Ten patients (67%) acutely responded by improvement of hemodynamic parameters with simultaneous reduction of catecholamine support. Catecholamine therapy was discontinued after a median of 28hours (IQR 16;60). The temporary leads were removed after a median of 6 days (IQR 3;10). Total in-hospital mortality was 47%, measuring 80% in non-responders and 30% in responders (p=0.119). There was no therapy related serious adverse event. CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that there may be a role for temporary LV stimulation as rescue therapy in selected patients with refractory cardiogenic shock. In clinical situations where aggressive therapies are used for urgent hemodynamic stabilization, temporary LV stimulation may evolve as a further and less invasive treatment option.
