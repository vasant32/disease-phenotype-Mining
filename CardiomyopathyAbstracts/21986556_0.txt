The aim of this study was to identify the genetic defect in two patients having cardiac dysfunction accompanied by neurological symptoms, and in one case MRI evidence of cortical and cerebellar atrophy with hyperintensities in the basal ganglia. Muscle biopsies from each patient revealed single and combined mitochondrial respiratory chain deficiency. The complete mtDNA sequencing of both patients revealed two transitions in the mitochondrial tRNA(Val) gene (MT-TV) (m.1628C>T in Patient 1, and m.1644G>A in Patient 2). The functional and molecular analyses reported here suggest that the MT-TV gene should be routinely considered in the diagnosis of mitochondrial cardiomyopathies.
