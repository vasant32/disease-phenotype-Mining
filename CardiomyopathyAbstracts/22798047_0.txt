Cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) and its primary signaling kinase, protein kinase G, play an important role in counterbalancing stress remodeling in the heart. Growing evidence supports a positive impact on a variety of cardiac disease conditions from the suppression of cGMP hydrolysis. The latter is regulated by members of the phosphodiesterase (PDE) superfamily, of which cGMP-selective PDE5 has been best studied. Inhibitors such as sildenafil and tadalafil ameliorate cardiac pressure and volume overload, ischemic injury, and cardiotoxicity. Clinical trials have begun exploring their potential to benefit dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction. This review discusses recent developments in the field, highlighting basic science and clinical studies.
