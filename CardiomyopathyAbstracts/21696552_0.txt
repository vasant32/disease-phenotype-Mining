A 9-year-old black African boy was hospitalized for heart failure revealing a severe left ventricular dysfunction associated with dilated cardiomyopathy, two submitral aneurysms, occlusion of the circumflex artery and a giant coronary artery aneurysm on the proximal left anterior descending artery. The boy was coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Though rare, association of Takayasu arteritis and submitral aneurysm leads to rethinking the pathogenesis of submitral aneurysm and suggests that some of them may be acquired. In our case, a common inflammatory process, possibly triggered by tuberculosis or HIV, may underlie Takayasu and submitral aneurysms.
