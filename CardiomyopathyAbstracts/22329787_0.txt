 BACKGROUND: The incidence of muscular ventricular septal defect (VSD) in children is rare, but its prevalence among hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) patients is surprisingly high. METHODS: We present a 24-year-old female with HCM associated with muscular VSD without significant symptoms or hemodynamic implications. CONCLUSION: Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging plays an important role in anatomic and functional noninvasive evaluation of these patients.
