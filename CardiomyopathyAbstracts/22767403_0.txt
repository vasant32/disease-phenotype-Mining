The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) can be firstly considered as a cellular fuel gauge. AMPK rapidly senses energy deprivation and orchestrates a metabolic response to maintain an acceptable energy level required for cell survival under such adverse condition. Its protective role during myocardial ischemia has been deeply documented. More recently, it has been shown that the role of AMPK extends to several nonmetabolic effects related to other cardiac pathologies comprising diabetic cardiomyopathy, cardiac hypertrophy, and heart failure. Here, we briefly review the different roles played by AMPK in the control of cardiac metabolism and function under normal and pathological conditions. The potential cardioprotective actions of AMPK and the relative importance of its energetic and nonmetabolic effects in these mechanisms are deeply discussed.
