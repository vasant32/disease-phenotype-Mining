The purpose of this report is to describe the clinical course of a 12% TBSA burn injury with takotsubo cardiomyopathy and to discuss this lesser known diagnosis. The authors performed a case study with retrospective chart review and conducted a literature search. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is characterized by severe left ventricular dysfunction that is incited by severe psychological or physical stress. The patient's treatment course was complicated by the underlying cardiomyopathy requiring intubation, volume expansion, and vasoactive medications. After treatment for her burn injuries, her cardiac myopathy resolved, and she was discharged home. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy may be precipitated by burn injury. Treatment is supportive, but it should be instituted quickly to avoid complications.
