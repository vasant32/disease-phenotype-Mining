 AIMS: The present study evaluates the relevance and additional safety value of pre-hospital discharge (PHD) testing in patients with implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) therapy. METHODS: From June 1998 to May 2009, 975 patients (830 male, 145 female) with ICD were screened retrospectively for failed PHD and analysed for its consequences, risk factors, and patient characteristics after successful intra-operative testing in the implantation procedure. RESULTS: Pre-hospital discharge testing procedure was performed in 809 cases. No serious adverse events (e.g. death, persistant ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia, stroke) occurred. The overall incidence of failed PHD was 1.4% (n = 11). The underlying mechanisms were defibrillation threshold failure in 9/11 cases and sensing failure in 2/11 cases. CONCLUSIONS: In this study predictors for PHD-failure are: (i) cardiomyopathy other than ischaemic or dilative, (ii) young age, and (iii) small or very large left ventricular end-diastolic diameter ( < 40 or > 65 mm). Particularly, (i) manufacture of device or leads, (ii) lead design, (iii) medical treatment, or (iv) gender have no significant influence on PHD failure.
