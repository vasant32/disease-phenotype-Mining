Abstract We report an association of ventricular non-compaction (VNC) and histiocytoid cardiomyopathy (HC). Both entities are rare and only two cases of their association have been reported previously in the medical literature. VNC is believed to be caused by an arrest of the normal endomyocardial development, resulting in a thin and compacted epicardial layer and a thickened non-compacted endocardial layer. HC is a rare arrhytmogenic disorder characterized by aggregates of oncocytic cells involving predominantly the subendocardium. These cells are thought to be abnormal Purkinje cells but a primitive myocardial precursor cannot be excluded. In our case, the histiocytoid cells showed strong cytoplasmic expression for the skeletal muscle transcription factor MyoD1, which could be attributed to cross-reactivity with an undetermined cytoplasmic antigen. In our opinion, the reported cases of coexistence of these two rare cardiomyopathies suggest a common pathogenesis rather than a casual and independent association.
