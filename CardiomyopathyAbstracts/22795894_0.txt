Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is a reversible condition, characterized by transient left ventricular systolic dysfunction, that mimics an acute coronary syndrome. It usually occurs after physical or emotional stress, predominantly in postmenopausal women, although it also can affect younger age groups and males. It often presents as chest pain or dyspnea with electrocardiographic changes and mild elevation of cardiac enzymes suggesting acute myocardial infarction. Coronary angiography excludes obstructive coronary disease, and imaging reveals ventricular apical akinesia and compensatory hypercontractility of the basal segments. Various pathophysiological mechanisms have been proposed for the syndrome, such as occult atherosclerotic disease, multivessel spasm and/or microvascular dysfunction. However, the most widely accepted hypothesis at present is an excess of catecholamines causing calcium overload in cardiac myocytes, leading to disruption of contraction and ventricular function. Treatment is essentially supportive, with spontaneous and complete reversal of the changes within days or weeks. However, the presence of complications and comorbidities may predict a more adverse prognosis. As much is still unknown about takotsubo cardiomyopathy and the number of reported cases is growing, we present a literature review.
