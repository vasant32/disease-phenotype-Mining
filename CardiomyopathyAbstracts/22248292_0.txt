Organ transplantation in multisystemic mitochondrial cytopathies is usually not performed because of perceived untoward complications. We report three patients with demonstrated oxidative phosphorylation defects and dilated cardiomyopathy who underwent cardiac transplant. All three patients tolerated immunosuppression medications and have had an excellent long-term outcome. Our results suggest that with proper patient selection in this population, cardiac transplantation is feasible and can have good outcomes.
