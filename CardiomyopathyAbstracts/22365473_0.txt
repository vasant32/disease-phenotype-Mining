 PURPOSE: Fabry disease (FD, OMIM 301500) is an X-linked lysosomal storage disorder due to deficient activity of the enzyme alpha-galactosidase A. Males and females exhibit severe organ involvement. The high incidence of otological symptoms was recently reported. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Monocentric and retrospective study of twenty-five patients with FD (13 families; seven males and 18 females). The patients underwent audiological assessment before initiation and during enzyme replacement therapy. We also analysed neurologic heart and kidney status. RESULTS: Twenty patients (80%; 13 females and seven males) complained of otologic symptoms. Audiological evaluation showed a sensorineural hearing loss in 17 patients, bilateral in 16 out of them. Vestibular examination showed a functional impairment in two patients (one female, one male). Correlations were found between hearing loss and either kidney disease (73,3%), neurological complications (100%) and cardiomyopathy (80%). Fourteen patients (56%; seven females, seven males) received enzyme replacement therapy. Improvement or stabilization of the audiological evaluation was reported in seven patients, whereas worsening was observed in three patients. CONCLUSION: This study confirms the high frequency of audiological involvements in females and males with FD. Our analysis suggests that the frequency of hearing loss is increased in the presence of renal or neurologic involvement or cardiomyopathy. There is no clinically significant efficacy of enzyme replacement therapy on hearing function. Although the pathophysiology remains unknown, a vascular mechanism responsible of the inner ear involvement seems to be privileged.
