The medical community has seen an explosive rise in the utilization of implantable mechanical circulatory support devices for late-stage cardiomyopathy. Care for these complex patients requires a basic understanding of device physiology and potential complications. This review focuses on an algorithm that incorporates a careful clinical history and examination with diagnostic modalities for the evaluation of a patient who is failing therapy with a continuous-flow left ventricular assist device, as well as the general management and optimization of patients implanted with an artificial heart.
