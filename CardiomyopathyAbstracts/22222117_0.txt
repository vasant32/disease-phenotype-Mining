Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is characterized by inappropriate left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in the setting of a nondilated left ventricle. HCM is often associated with asymmetric LVH, a family history of HCM, sarcomeric genetic mutations, and an increased risk of sudden cardiac death. There is a wide clinical variability in HCM presenting during childhood and a relative lack of data on the pediatric population. This review will cover HCM presenting in infancy, childhood, and adolescence.
