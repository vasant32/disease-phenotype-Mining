It was performed morphometric analysis of 55 cases which formed 4 groups: 1 - control group - 10 patients without neuroleptic treatment and heart diseases; 2 - 12 patients without heart disease treated with antipsychotic drugs; 3 - 17 - without cardia—Å pathology who died from neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS); 4 - 16 patients with neuroleptic cardiomyopathy (NCMP) who died from NMS. The damage of myocardium in NMS is a relatively acute process involving disturbances of microcirculation, interstitial edema and dystrophic-degenerative changes of cardiomyocytes (CMC). These changes worsen the previous abnormal state of the heart muscle (microfibrosis, CMC atrophy) caused by cardiotoxic side-effects of neuroleptics. The severity of the total myocardium damage in NMS is directly depended on the absence or presence of NCMP.
