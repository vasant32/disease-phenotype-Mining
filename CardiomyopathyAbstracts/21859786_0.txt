We present a 51-year-old man with cardiogenic shock in whom a percutaneous extracorporeal life support system (ECLS) was inserted to restore cardiopulmonary stability. After successful stabilization, a left ventricular assist device was implanted, using the ECLS without switching to a conventional cardiopulmonary bypass system to reduce its side effects.
