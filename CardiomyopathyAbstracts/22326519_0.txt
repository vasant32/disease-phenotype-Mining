Copeptin, in addition to troponin, has recently been suggested for non-invasive differentiation between Tako-Tsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC) and acute myocardial infarction (AMI). In order to test this hypothesis, we investigated release patterns of pituitary copeptin and cardiac troponin in 49 patients with TTC and 49 age-, gender-, and ECG-matched control patients with AMI. Elevated copeptin levels (i.e. >12 pmol/l) at cardiac catheterization were found in 23/49 (47%) TTC patients and 25/49 (51%) AMI patients. Of these, median copeptin levels were almost identical in both cohorts (34.1 vs. 35.4 pmol/l). Subgroup analysis according to ECG changes revealed that AMI patients with ST-segment elevation had 3.6-fold higher copeptin levels than AMI patients without ST-segment elevation (p<0.05). Furthermore, in patients with TTC and atypical (midventricular) ballooning on left ventricular angiography, copeptin levels were 5.7-fold higher than in TTC patients with a typical (apical) type of ballooning (p<0.01). Elevated troponin T levels (i.e. >0.01 μg/l) at catheterization were detectable in 47/49 (96%) TTC patients and 45/49 (92%) AMI patients; however, peak levels did not differ significantly between both cohorts (median 0.35 vs. 0.27 μg/l). Subgroup analysis according to ECG changes revealed 2-fold higher peak troponin T levels in TTC patients presenting with ST-segment elevation than non-ST-segment elevation (p<0.05). In conclusion, copeptin does not seem to significantly increase non-invasive differentiation between TTC and AMI. At present, coronary angiography, specifically in patients with ST-segment elevation at presentation remains absolutely mandatory.
