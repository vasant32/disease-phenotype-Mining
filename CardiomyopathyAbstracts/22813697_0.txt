Background: Because a close relationship between epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) and coronary artery disease (CAD) has been shown, the impact of functional, morphological and clinical parameters to identify potential determinants of EAT was investigated. Methods and Results: Clinical and cardiac magnetic resonance parameters were determined and correlated to the amount of EAT in 158 patients with CAD and 40 healthy subjects. Patients with CAD and left ventricular function (LVEF) ≥50% revealed significantly elevated EAT (36±11g/m²) compared to healthy controls (31±8g/m²) and to patients with LVEF <50% (26±8.0g/m²). In the whole study population, only LVEF (P=0.003), body mass index (BMI) (P=0.004) and left ventricular end diastolic diameter (LV-EDD) (P=0.004) remained significantly associated with EAT after multivariate analysis. Subgroup analysis in patients with CAD and LVEF ≥50% showed that BMI (P=0.03) was the only correlate of EAT. However, in patients with CAD and LVEF <50%, indexed LV end diastolic mass (LV-EDMI) (P=0.003) and the extent of late gadolinium enhancement (LGE %) (P=0.03) remained significantly correlated with EAT in multivariate analysis. Conclusions: The amount and the determinants of EAT differ according to the LVEF in patients with CAD. Thus, different amounts of EAT reflect different stages of CAD underlining the complex interaction of EAT in the pathogenesis and progression of ischemic cardiomyopathy.  (Circ J 2012; 76: 2426-2434).
