Although 'athlete's heart' usually constitutes a balanced dilation and hypertrophy of all four chambers, there is increasing evidence that intense endurance activity may particularly tax the right ventricle (RV), both acutely and chronically. We review the evidence that the high wall stress of the RV during intense sports may explain observed B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) elevations immediately after a race, may lead to cellular disruption and leaking of cardiac enzymes, and may even result in transient RV dilatation and dysfunction. Over time, this could lead to chronic remodelling and a pro-arrhythmic state resembling arrhythmogenic RV cardiomyopathy (ARVC) in some cases. ARVC in high-endurance athletes most often develops in the absence of underlying desmosomal abnormalities, probably only as a result of excessive RV wall stress during exercise. Therefore, we have labelled this syndrome 'exercise-induced ARVC'. Sports cardiologists should be aware that excessive sports activity can lead to cardiac sports injuries in some individuals, just like orthopaedic specialists are familiar with musculoskeletal sports injuries. This does not negate the fact that moderate exercise has positive cardiovascular effects and should be encouraged.
