The covalent attachment of SUMO polypeptides, or sumoylation, is an important regulator of the functional properties of many proteins. Among these are many proteins implicated in human diseases including cancer, Huntington's, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's Diseases, as well as spinocerebellar ataxia 1, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Two more recent additions to the list of human disease-associated proteins that are sumoylated are amyloid precursor protein and lamin A. APP sumoylation modulates A-beta peptide levels, suggesting a potential role in Alzheimer's Disease, and decreased lamin A sumoylation due to mutations near its SUMO site has been implicated in causing some forms of familial dilated cardiomyopathy. The findings of involvement of sumoylation in human diseases has sparked significant interest in finding pharmacologic and other mechanisms for altering the sumoylation of proteins in the cell, with the goal of developing new therapeutic interventions for combating these diseases.
