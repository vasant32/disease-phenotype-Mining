A 62-year-old man with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) had complete atrioventricular (AV) block and subsequent cardiac standstill. A previous electrocardiogram revealed a bifascicular block pattern. Because he also suffered from infective endocarditis of the native aortic valve, surgical therapy (dual-chamber permanent pacing, myectomy of the left ventricular outflow tract, and valve replacement) was performed. Complete AV block unrelated to a procedure is a rare complication in patients with HOCM, but it may be life-threatening. Therefore, a pre-existing cardiac conduction disturbance should be specifically recognized as the aura of a higher degree of AV block.
