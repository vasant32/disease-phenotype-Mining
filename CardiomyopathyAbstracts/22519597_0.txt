INTRODUCTION: Diabetic retinopathy remains one of the most feared complications of diabetes. Despite extensive research in the field, the molecular mechanism responsible for the development of this slow progressing disease remains unclear. In the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy, mitochondria are damaged and inflammatory mediators are elevated before the histopathology associated with the disease can be observed. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) regulate a variety of cellular functions including apoptosis and angiogenesis. Diabetic environment stimulates the secretion of several MMPs that are considered to participate in complications, including retinopathy, nephropathy and cardiomyopathy. Patients with diabetic retinopathy and also animal models have shown increased MMP-9 and MMP-2 in their retina and vitreous. Recent research has shown that MMPs have dual role in the development of diabetic retinopathy; in the early stages of the disease (pre-neovascularization), MMP-2 and MMP-9 facilitate the apoptosis of retinal capillary cells, possibly via damaging the mitochondria, and in the later phase, they help in neovascularization. AREAS COVERED: This article reviews the literature to evaluate the role of MMPs, especially MMP-9, in the development of diabetic retinopathy, and presents existing evidence that the inhibitors targeted toward MMP-9, depending on the duration of diabetes at the times their administration could have potential to prevent the progression of this blinding disease, and protect the vision loss. EXPERT OPINION: Inhibitors of MMPs could have dual role: in the early stages of the diseases, inhibit capillary cell apoptosis, and if the disease has progressed to the angiogenic stage, inhibit the growth of new vessels.
