We herein report the case of a 61-year-old woman with dilated phase of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (D-HCM) who had been diagnosed with HCM 17 years previously. On admission, her left ventricle (LV) had marked dilation, dyssynchrony with diffuse severe hypokinesis, and ventricular tachycardia. She had two mutations in the cardiac myosin binding protein-C gene, which were suspected to be the causes of the D-HCM. We performed LV reconstruction surgery and cardiac resynchronization therapy with a defibrillator for her drug-resistant severe heart failure. After surgery, her New York Heart Association class dramatically improved, and she has not been re-hospitalized since these treatments.
