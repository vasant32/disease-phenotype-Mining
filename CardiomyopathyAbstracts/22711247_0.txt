Hypertrophy of the left ventricular myocardium is a common finding and can be reliably detected by echocardiography, CT and MRI. Common causes include diseases associated with increased cardiac afterload as well as primary and secondary cardiomyopathy. With the opportunity to determine functional parameters and myocardial mass precisely as well as to detect structural changes of the cardiac muscle simultaneously, cardiac MRI is the most precise imaging method for quantifying left ventricular hypertrophy as well as determining the cause and the exact characterization of the myocardial changes. It is mandatory, however, to create a flexible, individually adapted examination protocol. This review presents useful diagnostic algorithms in relation to different underlying pathologies in patients with left ventricular hypertrophy.
