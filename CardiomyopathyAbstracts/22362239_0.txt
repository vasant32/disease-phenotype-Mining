Myocarditis seems to be mostly caused by a viral infection or more rarely by a pharmacological hypersensitivity or by radiations exposure. Nevertheless, it is not so easy to know the ethiopathogenesis of the myocarditis, because mostly it is impossible to determine the infectious agent that causes the pathology even if it is isolated. The diagnosis could often remain uncertain, so a suspect of myocarditis has to be opportunely confirmed by specific serological and diagnostic investigations, in order to avoid the appearance of a dilated cardiomyopathy which is one of its principal sequences.
