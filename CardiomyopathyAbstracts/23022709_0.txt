Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a common disorder of cardiac muscle associated with sudden cardiac death (SCD). HCM is defined by increased left ventricular wall thickness or mass, in the absence of abnormal loading conditions to account for the observed abnormality.(1) In most adults, the disease is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait and is caused by mutations in cardiac sarcomere protein genes.1 Histologically HCM is characterised by myocardial disarray, fibrosis and small vessel disease.(2) Macroscopically the hypertrophy is typically asymmetric and 25% of patients have resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO).(3)...
