Anthracycline chemotherapeutic agents of the topoisomerase inhibitor family are widely used for the treatment of various tumors. While targeted tumor tissues are generally situated in a hypoxic environment, the connection between efficacy of anthracycline agents and cellular hypoxia response has not been investigated in depth. Here, we report that doxorubicin (DXR) impairs the transcriptional response of the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) by inhibiting the binding of the HIF-heterodimer to the consensus -RCGTG- enhancer element. This pleiotropic effect retarded migration of von Hippel-Lindau (VHL)-defective renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and that of VHL-competent RCC in hypoxia. This effect was accompanied by a co-ordinated downregulation of HIF target lysyl-oxidase (LOX) family members LOX, LOX-like2 (LOXL2), and LOXL4. Furthermore, DXR suppressed HIF-target genes in tumor xenografts, inhibited cardiac induction of HIF targets in rats with acute anemia, and impaired the angiogenic response in the isoproterenol-induced heart failure model, which may account for the clinical fragility of doxorubicin cardiomyopathy. Collectively, these findings highlight the impaired hypoxia response by anthracycline agents affecting both tumors and organs of the cancer host and offer a promising opportunity to develop HIF-inhibitors using DXR as a chemical template.
