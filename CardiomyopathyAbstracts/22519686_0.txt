 BACKGROUND: Horses are extremely susceptible to ionophore intoxication. Although numerous reports are available regarding monensin, little is known about lasalocid toxicity. OBJECTIVES: To describe accidental lasalocid poisoning on a farm in Belgium. ANIMALS: Eighty-one horses, of which 14 demonstrated clinical signs from day 0-21 after being fed a new concentrate batch. One horse died on day 20 and another on day 27. METHODS: The most severe cases (n = 7), admitted to the clinic on day 29-46, underwent cardiac examination and blood biochemical analysis, including determination of plasma cardiac troponin I (cTnI) at admission and during follow-up. On day 57-70, cardiac examination, cTnI determination or both were undertaken on 72 remaining horses. RESULTS: Short-term effects of lasalocid intoxication included inappetance, lethargy, sweating, and muscular weakness. All 7 horses admitted to the clinic demonstrated signs of myocardial degeneration such as increased cTnI, dysrhythmia and reduced myocardial contractility. Four horses developed ataxia on day 40-50. Five horses died or were euthanized on day 30-370, 2 horses recovered fully and returned to previous athletic use. None of the 72 remaining horses exhibited clinical signs between day 57-70, but 34 had dysrhythmia and 13 had increased cTnI concentrations. After a period of rest, all horses returned to their previous work. Lasalocid was detected in hepatic tissue of 2 necropsied horses. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Lasalocid intoxication induced myocardial and neurological damage. Although uncommon, this should be included as differential diagnosis for unexplained inappetance, signs of depression, cardiomyopathy, and ataxia in horses.
