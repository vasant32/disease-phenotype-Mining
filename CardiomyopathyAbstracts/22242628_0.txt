 INTRODUCTION: Fasciculoventricular pathways (FVPs) are rare causes of preexcitation that do not mediate tachycardias. We report a two-center experience of pediatric patients with FVP and an unexpectedly high association of complex congenital heart defects (CHDs), chromosomal anomalies, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. METHODS: A retrospective review of the electrophysiology database at two institutions was performed to identify patients with FVP from January 2000 to January 2011. Medical records of these patients were reviewed for clinical history and course, presence of comorbidities, and details of intracardiac electrophysiology (EP) study. RESULTS: A total of 17 patients were identified. The primary indication for EP study was a preexcitation pattern on electrocardiogram. The majority of patients, 12/17 (71%), were found to have associated cardiac and genetic anomalies. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was found in 5/17 (29%) patients, with genetic testing in two patients demonstrating the lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2 mutation (Danon syndrome). Underlying complex CHDs were present in 3/17 (18%) patients. One patient (6%) was status post (s/p) cardiac transplant, one patient had hypertension, and another had Trisomy 21. Other electrophysiologic substrates mediating tachycardia were found in 3/17 (18%) patients. Only 5/17 patients (29%) were otherwise healthy with structurally normal hearts. CONCLUSIONS: In this largest reported series of FVP in children, there is an unusually high association of FVP with complex CHDs, chromosomal anomalies, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Any patient with such disorders and manifest preexcitation should be evaluated with a high index of suspicion for a FVP.
