Plakoglobin (PG, γ-Catenin, JUP), a member of the armadillo protein family and close homolog of β-catenin, functions to link cell surface cadherin molecules with the cytoskeleton. PG is the only junctional component found in both desmosomes and adherens junctions and thus plays a critical role in the regulation of cell-cell adhesion. Similar to β-catenin, PG is able to interact with components of the Wnt signaling pathway and directly affect gene expression by binding with LEF/TCF transcription factors. In addition, it has been proposed that PG functions primarily as a competitive inhibitor of β-catenin transcriptional activity by sequestering LEF/TCF. Compared to β-catenin, the contribution of PG as a transcriptional regulator in either physiological or pathological conditions is poorly understood. There is increasing clinical interest in PG as both a structural protein as well as a signaling molecule as mutations have been identified in the human PG gene that cause Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy (ARVC) and cutaneous syndromes. This review will discuss the connection between altered cell adhesion and gene expression and its contribution to disease pathogenesis.
