Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging has proven efficacy in the study of the heart. Its clinical applications are directed primarily at the study of the left ventricle, and the right ventricle is relegated to the background. This article reviews the anatomy and physiology of the right ventricle, as well as the manifestations of most common diseases affecting this chamber of the heart: infarction, cardiomyopathy, masses, and right heart failure. Knowing the distinctive features of the right ventricle with respect to the left and the particularities of the MR imaging protocol results in better technical performance in cases in which the reason for the examination or imaging findings point to the right ventricle. The importance of the right ventricle in the management of cardiopulmonary disease is growing and MR imaging can provide clinicians with the support they need.
