 BACKGROUND: Carnitine plays a key role in energy production in the myocardium. Carnitine deficiency commonly occurs in patients on chronic hemodialysis (HD) and may contribute to cardiomyopathy. METHODS: Carnitine levels and cardiac function of nine children on HD were assessed before and after 6 months of intravenous levocarnitine supplementation. Standard echocardiographic (ECHO) measures of left ventricular (LV) function as well as strain and strain rate analysis using novel speckle-tracking echocardiography were performed and the results compared to those of a control group of children on chronic HD. RESULTS: Following carnitine supplementation, total (49.0 ± 1.67 vs. 298.0 ± 31.8 μmol/L) and free carnitine (29.0 ± 1.20 vs. 180.4 ± 19.2 μmol/L) increased (p < 0.0001), and the acyl:free (A:F) carnitine ratio improved (0.73 ± 0.04 vs. 0.65 ± 0.05; p = 0.02). There were no changes in standard ECHO measures of LV function, including end diastolic dimension, mass index, ejection fraction, and fractional shortening. There was significant (p = 0.017) improvement in the longitudinal strain rate (-1.48 ± 0.11 vs -1.91 ± 0.12) after carnitine supplementation in the study group. No improvements in LV function, strain, or strain rate occurred in controls. CONCLUSIONS: Levocarnitine supplementation improved carnitine levels, the A:F ratio, and longitudinal strain rate in children on HD.
