Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI) plays an important role in the diagnosis and follow-up of apical ballooning syndrome (takotsubo syndrome), a recently described cardiac condition characterised by transient dyskinesia of the left ventricle secondary to an acute emotional event. We present the CMRI findings in a 53-year-old female diagnosed with apical ballooning syndrome and discuss its value in the diagnosis and follow-up of this condition.
