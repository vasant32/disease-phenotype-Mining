 BACKGROUND: Premature sudden cardiovascular death is the commonest cause of death in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients and is associated with uraemic cardiomyopathy [left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), systolic dysfunction (LVSD) or LV dilation]. High-energy phosphates (HEP), quantified using phosphorus-31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy, are reduced in patients with diabetes, heart failure and uraemia. Phosphocreatine:Î² adenosine triphosphate (PCr:ATP) ratio is an index of metabolic activity. We compared resting HEPs in ESRD patients and hypertensive patients (with and without LVH) who had normal renal function (LVH-only or normal myocardia). We also assessed associations of HEP levels with abnormalities of uraemic cardiomyopathy. METHODS: Fifty-three ESRD and 30 hypertensive patients (18 with LVH, 12 with normal myocardia) underwent phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy of their left ventricle. PCr:ATP ratios were calculated from (31)P-MR spectra obtained from long-axis views of the left ventricle. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in age, LV mass, chamber sizes and ejection fraction between patient groups. PCr:ATP was significantly lower in ESRD patients compared to hypertensive patients, irrespective of the presence or absence of LVH (P = 0.01). In the ESRD group, PCr:ATP was significantly lower in patients with LVSD (P = 0.05) and LV dilation (P = 0.01). LVH was not associated with significant difference in PCr:ATP. CONCLUSIONS: ESRD patients have lower HEP levels compared to hypertensive patients. Lower PCr:ATP ratio, indicating altered myocardial metabolic function in ESRD patients, is associated with features of uraemic cardiomyopathy.
