Anxiety following heart failure (HF) and/or myocardial infarction (MI) can impede recovery and constitute a major risk factor for further cardiac events. The present study was aimed to evaluate anxiety following doxorubicin (DOX)-induced cardiomyopathy, a rodent model for HF, in mice. Furthermore, the study investigated the effect of alprazolam on anxiety and cardiomyopathy in this model. The study was carried out in Swiss albino mice. DOX was used at a dose of 10 mg/kg i.v. Alprazolam was administered at doses of 0.5, 1 and 2 mg/kg po for 7 days' pre- and 7 days' post-DOX. Anxiety was measured on day 8 and on day 14 using elevated plus maze and Vogel's conflict test. On 14th day, serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was estimated. The mice were then killed and hearts were dissected out for estimation of thiobarbituric acid reactive substance and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) studies. Our results showed that DOX administration induced cardiomyopathy in mice. This was evidenced by an increased serum LDH and tissue malondialdehyde (MDA) and was confirmed by TEM studies. Alprazolam treatment for 14 days dose dependently reversed DOX-induced increase in LDH and MDA as well as the morphological alterations induced by DOX in TEM studies. Furthermore, alprazolam also reversed the anxiety-like effects induced by DOX in both the tests for anxiety. Thus, alprazolam appears to be a good candidate for alleviating anxiety in patients following MI or HF.
