 OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cardiac function changing before and after resection of pituitary tumor in patients with pituitary adenoma complicated with dilated cardiomyopathy with retrospective analysis method. METHODS: The clinical data of 14 cases of patients with pituitary adenoma complicated with dilated cardiomyopathy, treated with resection of pituitary tumor, in PLA General Hospital, from 2005 to 2011, were collected and analyzed. Comparative analysis of cardiac function were made in these patients before and after the surgery, also with the postoperative recovery status, using echocardiography and other noninvasive detection means to detect the growth hormone (GH), left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD), septal thickness (ST), left ventricular posterior wall thickness (LVPWT), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) values. RESULTS: After the resection of pituitary tumor, the LVEDD, ST, LVPWT, LVEF levels were all significantly better than that before the surgery. Before the surgery the GH, ST, LVPWT, LVEF levels were 93.89 µg/L, 11.13 mm, 43.92% and 10.53 mm, while those after the surgery were 5.16 µg/L, 10.64 mm, 49.28% and 8.87 mm. The difference of the GH level before and after the surgery was correlated with the difference of ST, LVEDD and LVEF in a linear manner. CONCLUSIONS: Recection of pituitary tumor can significantly improve the cardiac function in patients with pituitary adenoma complicated with dilated cardiomyopathy, and the cardiac function improving level is correlated with the difference of GH levels before and after the surgery.
