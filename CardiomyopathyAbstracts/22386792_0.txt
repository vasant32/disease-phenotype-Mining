 BACKGROUND: Previous studies reported an association between the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DQ antigen beta 1 chain (DQB1) alleles and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). However, the results of those studies have been inconsistent. To clarify the association between HLA-DQB1 and DCM, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of case-control studies. METHODS: Searches were performed using the PubMed database, the Excerpta Medica Database (EMBASE), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials database, the Science Citation Index database, the China Biology Medicine disc, the China National Knowledge Information database, the Wanfang database, and the Chinese Scientific and Technological Journal Database (VIP database). The search terms included "dilated cardiomyopathy" and "DQB1." Ten case-controlled studies were included in the systematic review to assess the association between DCM and the HLA-DQB1*0201, *0302, *0504, *0301, and *0602 alleles. RESULTS: In total, 8 studies were included in the meta-analysis of the HLA-DQB1 *0201 allele. The pooled odds risk (OR) for this allele was .47, with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of .28 to .77 (P < .01). With respect to the HLA-DQB1 *0504 allele, only 3 studies were included in our meta-analysis. The pooled OR was .36 (95% CI, .15 to .84; P < .05). Nine, 8, and 7 studies of the HLA-DQB1 *0301, *0302, and *0602 alleles, respectively, were included in our meta-analysis. No statistically significant difference was evident in the frequency of these 3 alleles between the DCM and normal control groups. CONCLUSION: The HLA-DQB1 *0201 and *0504 alleles may be protective against DCM.
