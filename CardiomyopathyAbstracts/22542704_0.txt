 BACKGROUND: Patients with frequent premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) are at risk of developing reversible PVC-induced cardiomyopathy (rPVC-CMP). Not all determinants of rPVC-CMP are known. OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of the QRS duration of PVCs on the development of rPVC-CMP. METHODS: In a consecutive series of 294 patients with frequent idiopathic PVCs referred for PVC ablation, the width of the PVC-QRS complex was assessed. The QRS width was correlated with the presence of rPVC-CMP. RESULTS: The PVC-QRS width was significantly greater in patients with rPVC-CMP than in patients without rPVC-CMP (164 ± 20 ms vs 149 ± 17 ms; P < .0001). The site of origin of the PVC had an impact on the PVC-QRS width, with epicardial PVCs having the broadest QRS complexes. Patients with PVCs originating from the right ventricular outflow tract or the fascicles had the narrowest QRS complexes. After adjusting for PVC burden, symptom duration, and PVC site of origin, PVC-QRS width and an epicardial PVC origin were independently associated with rPVC-CMP. Based on receiver operator characteristics analysis, a QRS duration of >150 ms best differentiated patients with and without rPVC-CMP (area under the curve 0.66; sensitivity 80%; specificity 52%). The PVC burden for developing rPVC-CMP is significantly lower in patients with a PVC-QRS width of ≥150 ms than in patients with a narrower PVC-QRS complex (22% ± 13% vs 28% ± 12%; P < .0001). CONCLUSION: Broader PVCs and an epicardial PVC origin are associated with the development of rPVC-CMP independent of the PVC burden.
