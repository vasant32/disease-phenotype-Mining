We report the case of a patient with ischemic cardiomyopathy who several years before underwent cardiac resynchronization therapy. He was admitted for surgical revision of the system due to coronary sinus lead failure. Percutaneous extraction of the lead was performed but an unusual complication related to the damaged lead occurred with relatively positive outcomes.
