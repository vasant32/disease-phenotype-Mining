Aging negatively affects angiogenesis which is found to be linked to declined vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production. Adult human thymus degenerates into fat tissue (thymus adipose tissue (TAT)). Recently, we described that TAT from cardiomyopathy ischemic subjects has angiogenic properties. The goal of our study was to analyze whether aging could also impair angiogenic properties in TAT as in other adipose tissue such as subcutaneous (subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT)). SAT and TAT specimens were obtained from 35 patients undergoing cardiac surgery, making these tissues readily available as a prime source of adipose tissue. Patients were separated into two age-dependent groups; middle-aged (n = 18) and elderly (n = 17). Angiogenic, endothelial, and adipogenic expression markers were analyzed in both tissues from each group and correlations were examined between these parameters and also with age. There were no significant differences in subjects from either group in clinical or biological variables. Angiogenic markers VEGF-A, B, C, and D and adipogenic parameters, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARγ2), FABP4, and ADRP showed elevated expression levels in TAT from elderly patients compared to the middle-aged group, while in SAT, expression levels of these isoforms were significantly decreased in elderly patients. VEGF-R1, VEGF-R2, VEGF-R3, Thy1, CD31, CD29, and VLA1 showed increased levels in TAT from the elderly compared to the middle-aged, while in SAT these levels displayed a decline with aging. Also, in TAT, angiogenic and endothelial parameters exhibited strong positive correlations with age. TAT appears to be the most appropriate source of angiogenic and endothelial factors in elderly cardiomyopathy subjects compared to SAT.
