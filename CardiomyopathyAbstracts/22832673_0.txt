BACKGROUND: -There is considerable heterogeneity in the myocardial substrate of patients undergoing CRT, in particular in the etiology of heart failure and in the location of conduction block within the heart. This may account for variability in response to CRT. New approaches including endocardial and multi-site LV stimulation may improve CRT response. We sought to evaluate these approaches using non-contact mapping to understand the underlying mechanisms. METHODS AND RESULTS: -10 patients (8M:2F), mean (SD) age 63(12) years, LVEF 24(6)%, QRS duration 161(24)ms fulfilling conventional CRT criteria underwent an electrophysiological study with assessment of acute hemodynamic response to conventional CRT as well as LV endocardial and multi-site pacing. LV activation pattern was assessed using non-contact mapping. LV endocardial pacing gave a superior acute hemodynamic response compared to conventional CRT (26% vs 37% increase in LV dP/dt(max) respectively, p<0.0005). There was a trend towards further incremental benefit from multi-site LV stimulation, although this did not reach statistical significance (p=0.08). The majority (71%) of patients with non-ischemic heart failure etiology or functional block responded to conventional CRT, whereas those with myocardial scar or absence of functional block often required endocardial or multi-site pacing in order to achieve CRT response. CONCLUSIONS: -Endocardial or multi-site pacing may be required in certain subsets of patients undergoing CRT. Patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy and those with narrower QRS in particular may stand to benefit.
