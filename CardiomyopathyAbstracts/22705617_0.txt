A 65-year-old female patient admitted to the emergency department was diagnosed with acute high lateral myocardial infarction, but later Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TC) was discovered. She had squeezing chest pain that started shortly after an emotional stress. The electrocardiogram revealed a loss of R wave voltage in leads V1 to V4 and an ST-segment elevation in I and aVL. After an urgent coronary angiography and ventriculography, TC was considered, and supportive anti-ischemic treatment was started. The severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction improved and normalized during the follow-up. She was discharged without any complications. TC is a new entity of acute cardiac events, and patients usually recover completely without sequelae with proper diagnosis and management. An exact diagnosis may also prevent an inappropriate application in the setting of recurrences.
