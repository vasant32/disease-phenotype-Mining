BACKGROUND: Inflammatory DCM (iDCM) may be related to autoimmune processes. An immunoadsorption (IA) has been reported to improve cardiac hemodynamics. The benefit of IA is probably related to the removal of autoantibodies. A recent study suggests additional effects of IA on the T cell-mediated immune reactions, especially on regulatory T cells (Tregs). In this prospective study, the correlation between the level of Tregs and improvement of myocardial contractility in response to IA in patients with iDCM was investigated. METHODS: Patients (n=18) with iDCM, reduced left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (< 35%) were enrolled for IA. Before and 6 months after IA, LV systolic function was assessed by echocardiography, and blood levels of Tregs were quantified by FACS analysis. Patients (n=12) with chronic ischemic heart failure and comparable reduced LV-EF served as controls. RESULTS: IA improved LV-EF in 12 of 18 patients at 6 months follow-up. These patients were classified as "IA Responder". In 6 patients LV EF remained unchanged. At baseline, IA Responder and Non-responder subgroups showed similar values for C-reactive protein, white blood cells, lymphocytes and T helper cells, but they differ for the number of circulating Tregs (Responder: 2.32+1.38% vs. Non-Responder: 4.86+0.28%; p<0.01). Tregs increased significantly in the IA responders, but remained unchanged in the IA non-responders. In patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy, none of these values changed over time. CONCLUSIONS: A low level of Tregs in patients with chronic iDCM may characterize a subset of patients who do best respond to IA therapy.
