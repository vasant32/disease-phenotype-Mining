 BACKGROUND: A spider monkey with severe dyspnea was referred to our clinic. METHODS AND RESULTS: Radiographs revealed an enlarged cardiac silhouette. Ventricular tachycardia and ST segment depression were also diagnosed after an ECG. These findings coupled with the postmortem examination confirmed dilatative cardiomyopathy. CONCLUSIONS: This case is worthy of presentation since dilatative cardiomyopathy has been rarely encountered in spider monkeys.
