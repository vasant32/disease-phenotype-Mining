Heart failure is a major health problem in developed countries and a growing one in developing countries. Cardiac remodeling in heart failure affects myocardial mechanics, which requires comprehensive evaluation in three dimensions. The novel technique of 3D wall motion tracking applies speckle tracking technology to full volume, 3D echocardiographic datasets. Quantification of conventional and novel left ventricular (LV) parameters including volumes, ejection fraction, global and regional 3D strain, endocardial area strain, twist, and dyssynchrony, and identification of the site of latest mechanical activation are feasible on the basis of a single acquisition of a full-volume dataset. Clinical applications of 3D wall motion tracking include the assessment of global and regional LV performance in ischemic and nonischemic heart diseases, evaluation of mechanics in cardiomyopathies and congenital heart disease, potential selection of patients for cardiac resynchronization therapy and prediction of their response, and detection of subclinical cardiac dysfunction in diseases with likelihood of progression to heart failure. Technological advances with improvement in spatial and temporal resolution of this novel imaging modality are expected. Although 3D wall motion tracking is still in its infancy, this method has begun to provide new insights into LV mechanics and has already found clinical applications. Future developments in 3D assessment of right ventricular and myocardial layer-specific mechanics are awaited.
