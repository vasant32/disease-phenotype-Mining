Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is a stress-related cardiomyopathy that mimics acute myocardial infarction. However, it is frequently without obstructive coronary artery disease and is mainly seen in postmenopausal women after an emotional or physiological event. In rare cases, it favours the formation of intracardiac mural thrombus and subsequent cardioembolic events. We report a rare case where a patient developed a cerebral infarction as a cardioembolic sequela of takotsubo cardiomyopathy following the death of her beloved dog. The patient was successfully managed with anticoagulation where a repeat echocardiogram 4&emsp14;months later showed resolution of the apical thrombus along with recovery of systolic function and left ventricle regional wall abnormalities. This case serves to increase awareness about the rare cardioembolic complications of takotsubo cardiomyopathy and emphasise the need for serial echocardiographic examinations and anticoagulation.
