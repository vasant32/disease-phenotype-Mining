BACKGROUND: The purpose of our study was to correlate the incidence of adequate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) interventions in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) patients with risk markers (RMs) for sudden cardiac death (SCD) plus myocardial fibrosis as detected by late gadolinium-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance (LGE-CMR) imaging. METHODS: In all, 87 patients with HCM underwent LGE-CMR imaging prior to ICD implantation, performed for secondary (n = 2; 2%) or primary SCD prophylaxis (n = 85; 98%). Fibrosis was graded with a 17-segment left ventricular model (0 = absent, 1 = point-shaped, 2 = limited to 1 left ventricular segment, 3 = involving ≥ 2 segments). During follow-up, ICD memories were read out by a physician blinded to the individual patient data. RESULTS: The number of RMs per patient was 1.9 ± 0.8. Myocardial fibrosis was present in 78 patients (90%); 26 (30%) had a fibrosis score of 3. During follow-up (3.5 ± 2.6 [range, 0.2-11.4 years]), 15 patients had 50 appropriate ICD interventions. Episodes of atrial fibrillation were found in 28 patients. Fibrosis severity correlated with occurrence of ventricular tachycardia (Cramér's V, or φc = 0.4, P < 0.001) and atrial fibrillation (φc = 0.6, P < 0.001). On multivariate regression analysis, an independent association between myocardial fibrosis (ß = 0.6, P < 0.01) and sustained ventricular tachycardia was found. CONCLUSIONS: In HCM patients treated with ICD implantation because of a high SCD risk by traditional RM assessment, a high rate of arrhythmic events was observed during long-term follow-up. In a cohort of patients with clinical markers for high risk of SCD, severity of myocardial fibrosis as detected by an easy LGE-CMR scoring system was associated with future arrhythmic events and appropriate ICD therapies.
