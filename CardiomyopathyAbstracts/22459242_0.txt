 OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association of ADIPOQ variants, total and high molecular weight adiponectin (HMW) adiponectin levels with the prevalence of diabetes mellitus and coronary artery disease (CAD) diagnosed by coronary angiography in Brazilian subjects with high cardiovascular risk. METHODS: 603 subjects undergoing coronary angiography were studied in regard to their glycemic status and presence of CAD (lesions >0%). We evaluated baseline concentrations of total and HMW adiponectin and three ADIPOQ variants: -11391G>A (rs17300539), +45T>G (rs2241766) and+276G>T (rs1501299). RESULTS: The G-allele of rs2241766 was associated with higher levels of total and HMW adiponectin, and the A-allele of rs17300539 was associated with higher levels of HMW adiponectin. Lower levels of total and HMW adiponectin were independently associated with CAD. The G-allele of rs2241766 (OR 2.45, 95% C.I. 1.05-6.04, p=0.04) and the G-allele of rs1501299 (OR 1.89, 95% C.I. 1.04-3.45, p=0.03) were associated with CAD, and these associations were independent of circulating levels of adiponectin. CONCLUSIONS: In Brazilian subjects with high cardiovascular risk, CAD was associated with lower total and HMW adiponectin levels. The rs2241766 and rs1501299 polymorphisms were associated with CAD. The rs2241766 variant was associated with total and HMW adiponectin levels, while rs17300539 was associated with HMW adiponectin levels.
