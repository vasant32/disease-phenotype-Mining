Twelve-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) in patients with Tako-Tsubo Cardiomyopathy (TTC) is characterized as QT interval prolongation and deep negative T wave, but its electrophysiological mechanism has not been clarified. In the article published on this issue in Heart Rhythm, Marra et al. studied 20 consecutive patients with TTC using cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) and 12-lead ECGs. The authors suggested that the apico-basal gradient of myocardial edema is a cause of the ECG pattern in patients with TTC. This was because significany clinical association was demonstrated between the repolarization abnormalities on ECG and myocardial edema as evidenced by apico-basal signal intensity gradient on CMR. The study by Marra et al. give us a new and important insight both into the reversible wall motion abnormality and transiently observed ECG characteristics of TTC.
