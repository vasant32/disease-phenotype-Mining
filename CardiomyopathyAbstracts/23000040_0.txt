BACKGROUND: Patients with chronic right ventricular pacing (RVP) upgraded to cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) have been excluded from the majority of clinical trials of CRT. Little is known with regard to predictors of response in this population. We hypothesized that reversal of RVP-induced electrical dyssynchrony (indexed by QRS duration) by CRT would predict a favorable response. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to identify baseline characteristics associated with response in patients upgraded to CRT from chronic RVP. METHODS: Consecutive patients presenting for CRT at the Cleveland Clinic between 9/30/2003 and 7/8/2008 with chronic RVP and serial echocardiograms were included in this analysis. RVP was defined as >85% pacing on a pre-CRT device check, previous AV node ablation, or complete pacer dependency per chart notes. Response was defined as a reduction in left ventricular end-systolic volume (LVESV) of≥15% from baseline. Clinical, electrocardiographic, and echocardiographic data were extracted to determine covariates associated with response. RESULTS: 112 patients met inclusion criteria of whom 72 (64.3%) met criteria for response over a median follow up of 9.9 months (interquartile range (6.5-14.7)). No significant differences were noted in terms of male gender (68.1% vs. 75.0%, p=0.52), ischemic cardiomyopathy (55.6% vs. 55.0%, p=1.0), pre-CRT QRS duration (ms) (189.1±vs 185.5±26.8, p=0.47), duration of RVP prior to CRT upgrade (years) (5.8±3.9 vs. 6.2±4.0, p=0.57), or baseline LVESV(ml)(160.0±60.7 vs. 172.8±67.2, p=0.32) between responders and non-responders, respectively. Percent reduction in QRS duration between the right ventricular-paced and first biventricular-paced waveform was significantly greater in responders compared to non-responders (%)(14.4±13.2 vs. 7.2±14.0, p=0.01). In multivariate analysis, percent reduction in QRS narrowing was the lone factor associated with response (odds ratio 0.02 (0.001-0.42), p=0.01). CONCLUSION: Reversal of electrical dyssynchrony predicts response to CRT in chronically RV paced patients upgraded to CRT. Traditional factors associated with a favorable response to CRT in de novo implants (female gender, non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, and a wider baseline QRS duration) are not significantly associated with response in upgraded patients. Duration of RVP prior to CRT upgrade is not an important determinant of response.
