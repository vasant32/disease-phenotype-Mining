For different lung and heart diseases (e.g., acute respiratory distress syndrome, congenital heart failure, and cardiomyopathy) extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is a well-established therapy, particularly in the field of neonatal and pediatric medicine. To reduce the priming volume of the extracorporeal circuit, different components can be combined. In this study, an oval-shaped oxygenator (called ExMeTrA) with integrated pulsatile pump was tested in vitro using porcine blood. A feasibility study regarding the performance of collapsing and expanding silicone tubes within an oxygenator fiber bundle as a pulsatile pump was previously completed with successful results. The findings of this study improve upon the previous feasibility results, particularly in terms of gas exchange and filling volume. Five modules were manufactured in sizes of 20 ± 2.2 ml (priming volume) with fiber surface areas of 0.24 ± 0.027 m(2) and an analytically calculated volume pumping capacity of 692 ± 75 ml/min. The modules were made of polymethylpentene fibers with dense outer layer to permit long-term applications. The gas exchange rates at a gas/blood flow ratio of 2:1 were between 64 and 72.7 ml(O)(2)/l(blood) and between 62.5 and 81.5 ml/l(blood), depending on the blood flow. The individual module's pumping capacity ranged from 200-500 ml/min thus providing room for further improvements. In order to enhance the pumping capacity while maintaining sufficient gas exchange rates future optimization, adjustments will be made to the inlet and outlet geometries.
