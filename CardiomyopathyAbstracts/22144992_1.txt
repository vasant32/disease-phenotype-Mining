The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an organelle entrusted with lipid synthesis, calcium homeostasis, protein folding, and maturation. Perturbation of ER-associated functions results in an evolutionarily conserved cell stress response, the unfolded protein response (UPR) that is also called ER stress. ER stress is aimed initially at compensating for damage but can eventually trigger cell death if ER stress is excessive or prolonged. Now the ER stress has been associated with numerous diseases. For instance, our recent studies have demonstrated the important role of ER stress in diabetes-induced cardiac cell death. It is known that apoptosis has been considered to play a critical role in diabetic cardiomyopathy. Therefore, this paper will summarize the information from the literature and our own studies to focus on the pathological role of ER stress in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy. Improved understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying UPR activation and ER-initiated apoptosis in diabetic cardiomyopathy will provide us with new targets for drug discovery and therapeutic intervention.
