A 33-year-old patient with nonischemic cardiomyopathy presented with cardiogenic shock requiring percutaneous left ventricular assist device placement despite inotropic support. Under transthoracic two-dimensional echocardiographic guidance, an Impella 2.5 L heart pump was placed. The inflow catheter was distal to the aortic valve, however patient remained in shock. Real time three-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography showed the inflow catheter imbedded into the papillary muscle causing inlet occlusion. By cropping 3D data set in multiple planes, a better spatial visualization of the inflow catheter and its distance from the aortic valve was easily obtained and the device was adjusted.
