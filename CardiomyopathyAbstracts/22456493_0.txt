Buprenorphine/naloxone is used for the treatment of opioid dependence. In the following case, a potential use for the medication combination is explored in the arena of transplant surgery. Psychiatry was consulted for a 29-year-old woman with iatrogenic opioid dependence after bilateral ventricular assist device placement for congenital cardiomyopathy. Her ejection fraction was less than 15% and she was considered a poor candidate for transplant due to drug-seeking behaviors. We transitioned her onto buprenorphine/naloxone to prevent abuse and control symptoms, qualifying her for cardiac transplant. After transplant, we coordinated care with cardiothoracic surgeons to restart buprenorphine/naloxone, and the patient has been stable for 8 months.
