Sleep apnea is frequently observed in patients with heart failure (HF). In general, sleep apnea consists of two types: obstructive and central sleep apnea (OSA and CSA, respectively). OSA results from upper airway collapse, whereas CSA arises from reductions in central respiratory drive. In patients with OSA, blood pressure is frequently elevated as a result of sympathetic nervous system overactivation. The generation of exaggerated negative intrathoracic pressure during obstructive apneas further increases left ventricular (LV) afterload, reduces cardiac output, and may promote the progression of HF. Intermittent hypoxia and post-apneic reoxygenation cause vascular endothelial damage and possibly atherosclerosis and consequently coronary artery disease and ischemic cardiomyopathy. CSA is also characterized by apnea, hypoxia, and increased sympathetic nervous activity and, when present in HF, is associated with increased risk of death. In patients with HF, abolition of coexisting OSA by continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) improves LV function and may contribute to the improvement of long-term outcomes. Although treatment options of CSA vary compared with OSA treatment, CPAP and other types of positive airway ventilation improve LV function and may be a promising adjunctive therapy for HF patients with CSA. Since HF remains one of the major causes of mortality in the industrialized countries, the significance of identifying and managing sleep apnea should be more emphasized to prevent the development or progression of HF.
