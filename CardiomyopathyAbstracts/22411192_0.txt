According to the current guidelines, patients with ischaemic cardiomyopathy (ICM) or non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy (NICM) at risk for sudden cardiac death should undergo implantation of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). Although ICDs effectively terminate ventricular arrhythmias, the arrhythmogenic substrate remains unchanged or may progress over time, resulting in recurrent ICD shocks. Defibrillator shocks increase mortality and worsen quality of life. Evidence from two prospective randomized trials on outcome in patients with ischaemic heart disease undergoing catheter ablation for ventricular tachycardia (VT) suggests that ablation prevents recurrence of VT and decreases the number of ICD shocks. This review will highlight the recent progress made in the ablative treatment of VT in patients with ICM and NICM.
