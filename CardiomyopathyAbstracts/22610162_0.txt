Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC), also known as transient left ventricular (LV) apical ballooning syndrome, is characterized by transient LV dysfunction. We present the case of a 72-year-old man who was diagnosed as having TTC after surgery for two lung tumors. The patient was treated with induction chemoradiotherapy (CRT) followed by pulmonary resections for double primary non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC): cT4N1M0 disease in the right lung and cT2N0M0 in the left lung. Induction CRT was performed. A right upper lobectomy was initially performed, and a left upper divisionectomy was subsequently performed. At 3 days after the second surgery, he developed dyspnea and general fatigue accompanied by a T-wave inversion on electrocardiography (ECG). An echocardiogram revealed akinesis at the apex with a 30 % ejection fraction. He was diagnosed as having TTC and recovered with supportive care. This case is the first report of TTC occurring after tri-modality therapy for NSCLC.
