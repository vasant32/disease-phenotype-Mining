Use of mechanical circulatory support (MCS) is a part of today's standard therapy in the treatment of end-stage heart failure. In this paper we describe characteristics of Thoratec pVAD device for MCS, implantation techniques, as well as the most important advantages and complications of application of the device. We present a 41-year-old patient with dilatated cardiomyopathy, who was the first recipient ofparacorporeal left ventricular assist device (LVAD) in the Republic of Croatia due to end-stage heart failure. After heart function recovery the patient was successfully weaned from MCS after 130 days of support.
