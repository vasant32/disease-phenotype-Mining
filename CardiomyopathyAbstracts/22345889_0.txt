The war against cancer has seen a proliferation in armamentarium over the last decades. A new antineoplastic agent, trastuzumab, was synthesized in 1991 and gained United States Food and Drug Administration approval in 1998 for treatment of metastatic breast cancer. Cardiotoxicity manifesting as dilated cardiomyopathy is a rarely reported adverse effect of trastuzumab. We hereby report a case of dilated cardiomyopathy, which occurred following trastuzumab chemotherapy in a 32-year-old female. The patient responded to discontinuation of trastuzumab and standard medical treatment. Extensive search of Indian literature revealed no reported case of dilated cardiomyopathy occurring due to trastuzumab.
