A 61-year-old male underwent a cardiac transplant for congenital dilated cardiomyopathy. Two months post-transplantation, after a complicated clinical course, he was noted to have progressive proptosis and limitation of motility OD. Computed tomography showed opacification of the right maxillary sinus with the suggestion of a fungus ball and soft tissue infiltration along the floor of the orbit adjacent to the inferior rectus, extending posteriorly to within millimeters of the superior and inferior orbital fissures. An orbital biopsy demonstrated the presence of fungal hyphae and A. fumigatus was cultured. The patient was treated with systemic antifungal therapy and intralesional retrobulbar amphotericin B (without debridement) with successful eradication of the fungal pathogen. Intralesional amphotericin in combination with systemic antifungal therapy without limited debridement is rarely reported and may be an alternative to limited debridement or exenteration in orbital aspergillosis.
