The intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) can be used transiently to improve cardiac function mechanically, in patients with severe cardiomyopathy and heart failure refractory to medical therapy. In the field of surgery, the IABP is most commonly used for patients with myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, or other chronic cardiac conditions, who are undergoing cardiac surgery. Conversely, it is rarely used in hepatobiliary surgery, with only two reports found in the literature, excluding cases of emergency cholecystectomy. We describe how we used an IABP successfully during surgery to repair a transected bile duct in a patient with peripartum cardiomyopathy.
