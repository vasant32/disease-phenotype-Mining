Angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) is a monocarboxypeptidase that metabolises angiotensin (ANG)-II into angiotensin 1-7 (ANG 1-7), thereby functioning as a negative regulator of the renin-angiotensin system. We investigated whether treatment with ANG-II type 1 receptor blocker, olmesartan medoxomil is associated with the attenuation of cardiac myosin-induced dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) through recently established new axis of ACE-2/ANG 1-7 mas receptor. DCM was elicited in Lewis rats by immunisation with cardiac myosin, and 28 days after immunisation, the surviving Lewis rats were divided into two groups and treated with either olmesartan medoxomil (10 mg/kg/day) or vehicle. Myocardial protein and mRNA levels of ACE-2, ANG 1-7 mas receptor were upregulated in the olmesartan-treated group compared with those of vehicle-treated DCM rats. In contrast, Olmesartan treatment effectively suppressed the myocardial protein and mRNA expressions of inflammatory markers in comparison to the vehicle-treated DCM rats. Olmesartan treatment significantly reduced fibrosis, hypertrophy and their marker molecules (OPN, CTGF, ANP and GATA-4, respectively), as well as matrix metalloproteinases compared with those of vehicle-treated DCM rats. Enhanced myocardial protein levels of phospho-p38 MAPK, phospho-JNK and phospho MAPKAPK-2 in the vehicle-treated DCM rats were prevented by olmesartan treatment. In addition, olmesartan treatment significantly lowered the protein expressions (Nitrotyrosine, p47phox and p67phox) and superoxide radical production compared with those of vehicle-treated DCM rats. Our present study might serve as a new therapeutic target of DCM in cardiovascular diseases and cardiac myosin-induced DCM via the modulation of ACE-2/ANG 1-7 mas receptor axis in rats with DCM after myosin-immunisation.
