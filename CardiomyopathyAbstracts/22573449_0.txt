D166V point mutation in the ventricular myosin regulatory light chain (RLC) is one of the causes of familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (FHC). We show here that the rates of cross-bridge attachment and dissociation are significantly different in isometrically contracting cardiac myofibrils from right ventricle of WT and Tg-D166V mice. To avoid averaging over ensembles of molecules composing muscle fibers, the data was collected from a single molecule. Kinetics were derived by tracking the orientation of a single actin molecule by fluorescence anisotropy. Orientation oscillated between two states, corresponding to the actin-bound and actin-free states of the myosin cross-bridge. The cross-bridge in a wild-type (healthy) heart stayed attached and detached from thin filament on average for 0.7 and 2.7 s, respectively. In FHC heart, these numbers increased to 2.5 and 5.8 s, respectively. These findings suggest that alterations in myosin cross-bridge kinetics associated with D166V mutation of RLC ultimately affect the ability of a heart to efficiently pump the blood.
