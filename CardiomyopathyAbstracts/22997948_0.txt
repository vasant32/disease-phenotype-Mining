Light and electron microscopies were used to analyze cardiomyocyte structural changes in the dilated left ventricle in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and valvular heart diseases. The patients were found to have cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and ultrastructural rearrangement with a tissue-specific reduction. There was hypertrophic cardiomyocyte lengthening that continued after these cells stopped growing thicker, as well as occurred due to the loss of myofibrils, which increased during the cell rearrangement, and directly correlated with the lower ejection fraction and higher end-systolic volume of the left ventricle.
