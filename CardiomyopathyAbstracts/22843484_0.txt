Management of patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy (NICM) and ventricular tachycardia (VT) remains challenging. The role of catheter ablation for VT continues to evolve for these patients. Prior reports have described the location of the arrhythmogenic substrate for patients with NICM to be frequently located along the basal left ventricle, with an epicardial predilection. Furthermore, predictors for identifying whether mapping the endocardium or epicardial surface of the heart have been identified for improved success of VT ablation in this patient population. This chapter will review the latest advances in catheter ablation of ventricular tachycardia in patients with NICM.
