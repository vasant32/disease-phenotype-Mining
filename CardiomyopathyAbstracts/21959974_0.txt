Familial Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (FHC) is an autosomal dominant disorder affecting the cardiac muscle and exhibits varied clinical symptoms because of genetic heterogeneity. Several disease causing genes have been identified and most code for sarcomere proteins. In the current study, we have carried out clinical and molecular analysis of FHC patients from India. FHC was detected using echocardiography and by analysis of clinical symptoms and family history. Disease causing mutations in the Î²-cardiac myosin heavy chain (MYH7) and Myosin binding protein C3 (MYBPC3) genes were identified using Polymerase Chain Reaction-Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid (PCR-DNA) sequencing. Of the 55 patient samples screened, mutations were detected in only nineteen in the two genes; MYBPC3 mutations were identified in 12 patients while MYH7 mutations were identified in five, two patients exhibited double heterozygosity. All four MYH7 mutations were missense mutations, whereas only 3/9 MYPBC3 mutations were missense mutations. Four novel mutations in MYBPC3 viz. c.456delC, c.2128G>A (p.E710K), c.3641G>A (p.W1214X), and c.3656T>C (p.L1219P) and one in MYH7 viz. c.965C>T (p.S322F) were identified. A majority of missense mutations affected conserved amino acid residues and were predicted to alter the structure of the corresponding mutant proteins. The study has revealed a greater frequency of occurrence of MYBPC3 mutations when compared to MYH7 mutations.
