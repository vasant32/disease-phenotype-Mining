Broken-heart syndrome also known as Left ventricular apical ballooning syndrome or Stress-induced cardiomyopathy or Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is an important clinical entity, which presents clinically, similar to acute coronary syndrome with an acute onset of chest pain, ST-T changes in electrocardiogram, and moderate cardiac enzyme elevation. Recent studies have shown that it accounts for 1%-2% of cases of ST-elevation infarction. An episode of intense emotional or physiologic stress has been reported before its presentation and is presumed to be the triggering factor in the pathogenesis. The pathophysiology of this syndrome still remains unclear, and management is mostly empiric and supportive. In this review, we have discussed various pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying this cardiomyopathy and their pharmacological implications and role of medications such as aspirin, beta blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and statins for patients presenting with this syndrome in treatment and prevention.
