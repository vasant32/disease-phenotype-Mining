An alternative to median sternotomy for epicardial placement of an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) lead in a child with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is described. Implantation of an ICD lead via the tricuspid valve was avoided by the use of an epicardial pacing lead and a transvenous defibrillator lead placed in the vena brachiocephalica. The abdominal, subcostal pocket incision was used for an anterolateral minithoracotomy to implant the epicardial pacing lead.
