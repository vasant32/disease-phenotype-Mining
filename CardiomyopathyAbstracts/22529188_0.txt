OBJECTIVE: The classic Morrow technique for hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) in patients with simultaneous obstruction of left ventricular (LV) midcavity and right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) combined with extreme left ventricular hypertrophy, is not effective. A new technique for HOCM surgical correction in patients with severe hypertrophy is proposed. METHODS: The excision of the asymmetrical hypertrophied area of the interventricular septum (IVS) causing simultaneous midventricular and RVOT obstruction was performed from the conal part of the right ventricle (RV) in the middle part of the right side of the IVS. Conceptually, this approach offers a number of advantages: it affords the excision of the asymmetrically hypertrophied area of the ventricular septum without penetration into the left ventricular cavity, it avoids mechanical damage to the heart conduction system and aortic valve and, for the surgeon, it improves the visual inspection of the area to be resected. Seven patients with the midventricular obstruction of the LV associated with RVOT obstruction [mean New York Heart Association (NYHA) class 3.0] underwent this procedure. The follow-up period was 24.8 ± 11.3 months. RESULTS: Six patients were free of symptoms (NYHA class I) and one was in NYHA class 2. There were no early or late deaths. The mean value of the echocardiographic intraventricular gradients in the LV decreased from 86.3 ± 9.9 to 10.3 ± 5.3 mmHg, the mean value of the gradients in the RVOT decreased to 44.9 ± 9.6 versus 4.1 ± 1.2 mmHg. Sinus rhythm without the block of the bundle of the right branch was noted in all patients after surgery. No patients needed the implantation of a cardioverter-defibrillator. CONCLUSION: This technique for the surgical correction of HOCM provides the effective simultaneous elimination of LV midventricular and RVOT obstruction. A major advantage is that injuries, in particular to the conduction system, are easily avoided.
