BACKGROUND: Hypocalcemia is very rare reversible cause of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCMP) witch can concern one or both ventricules. We here presented two cases of DCMP that caused by hypocalcemia and recovered totally after oral calcium and vitamin D supplementation. CASE PRESENTATION 1: A 29-year-old Caucasian female was admitted in our hospital due to congestive heart failure with dyspnea (NYHA class IV) and generalized edema for 2days. She had a history of total thyroidectomy one year a go. She had taken synthyroid as a daily medication associated to calcium supplementation and vitamin D because of hypoparathyroidism. Patient was not compliant to treatment. Trans thoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed a dilated left ventricule (LV) with global hypokinesia with 28% of left ventricule ejection and moderate mitral regurgitation. Laboratory test showed a severe hypocalcemia. After correction of hypocalcemia, there was a clear clinical improvement and four months later a total recovery was found. CASE PRESENTATION 2: A 44-year-old Caucasian male was referred to the hospital for rebel congestive heart failure with dyspnea and edema of lower limbs despite optimal treatment. Patient had no medical past history. TEE showed dilated cardiomyopathy with severe alteration of left ventricule systolic function (25%). Biological tests showed a hypocalcemia and primary hypoparathyroidism. An improvement of symptoms after correction of metabolic disorder was found. LV gradually recovered its performance. CONCLUSION: Patients outcome in end stage heart failure is different from the classical outcomes in patients with hypocalcemia induced heart disease. DCMP induced by hypocalcemia should be considered in patients with heart failure associated with medical conditions leading to hypocalcemia. It requires a specific treatment.
