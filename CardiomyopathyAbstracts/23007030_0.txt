Background:Risk factors for diastolic dysfunction in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) are poorly understood. We investigated the association of variants in hypoxia-response genes with phenotype severity in pediatric HCM.Methods:Eighty unrelated patients <21 years old and 14 related members from 8 families with HCM were genotyped for 6 variants associated with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGFA) downregulation, or hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF1A) upregulation. Associations between risk genotypes and left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy, LV dysfunction, and freedom from myectomy were assessed. Tissue expression was measured in myocardial samples from 17 HCM and 20 non-HCM patients.Results:Age at enrolment was 9±5 years (follow-up, 3.1±3.6 years). Risk allele frequency was 67% VEGFA and 92% HIF1A. Risk genotypes were associated with younger age at diagnosis (p<0.001), septal hypertrophy (p<0.01), prolonged E-wave deceleration time (p<0.0001) and isovolumic relaxation time (p<0.0001) and lower freedom from myectomy (p<0.05). These associations were seen in sporadic and familial HCM independent of the disease-causing mutation. Risk genotypes were associated with higher myocardial HIF1A and TGFB1 expression and increased endothelial-fibroblast transformation (p<0.05).Conclusions:HIF1A upregulation and/or VEGFA downregulation genotypes were associated with more severe septal hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction and may provide genetic markers to improve risk prediction in HCM.Pediatric Research (2012); doi:10.1038/pr.2012.126.
