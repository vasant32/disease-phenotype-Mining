We present the case of a 69-year-old woman with end-stage hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy who developed cardiogenic shock. She underwent emergent placement of a percutaneous left ventricular assist device (TandemHeart) in the catheterization lab as a bridge support device until a septal myectomy could be performed as definitive treatment. This case suggests a novel and promising use of the TandemHeart as a bridge to myectomy.
