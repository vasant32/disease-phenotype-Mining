Striated muscle contraction is regulated by dynamic and cooperative interactions among Ca(2+), troponin, and tropomyosin on the thin filament. While Ca(2+) regulation has been extensively studied, little is known about the dynamics of individual regulatory units and structural changes of individual tropomyosin molecules in relation to their mechanical properties, and how these factors are altered by cardiomyopathy mutations in the Ca(2+) regulatory proteins. In this hypothesis paper, we explore how various experimental and analytical approaches could broaden our understanding of the cooperative regulation of cardiac contraction in health and disease.
