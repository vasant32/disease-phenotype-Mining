BACKGROUND: Bipolar voltage mapping has a role in defining endocardial-based scar in postinfarct patients undergoing VT catheter ablation. The utility of bipolar and unipolar voltages in characterizing scar has not been evaluated in patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy. OBJECTIVE: We sought to relate LV endocardial bipolar and unipolar voltages in these patients to scar transmurality (endocardial vs. nonendocardial) and composition (homogeneous core vs. heterogeneous gray). METHODS: Ten consecutive cardiomyopathy patients undergoing endocardial LV VT ablation were included (48±14yrs, LVEF 43±15%). Preablation late gadolinium-enhanced MRI (LGE-MRI) was used to quantify core and gray scar using signal-intensity thresholding. Electroanatomic LV endocardial mapping provided bipolar and unipolar voltages. Electroanatomic maps and LGE-MRI were rigidly registered in order to relate voltage to scar (registration error 3.6±2.9mm). RESULTS: Bipolar voltage was lower in endocardial core compared to no scar (p<0.001). Unipolar voltage was lower in endocardial core and nonendocardial core than no scar (p<0.001). Endocardial and nonendocardial gray scar had a similar effect to core in reducing bipolar and unipolar voltages (p<0.001). The mass of healthy myocardium, and endocardial core scar independently predicted bipolar and unipolar voltages using GEE modeling. With ROC analysis, bipolar voltage >1.9 mV and unipolar voltage <6.7 mV had a high negative predictive value (91%) for detecting nonendocardial scar from either endocardial scar or no scar. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy, LV endocardial bipolar voltage is dependent on endocardial core and gray scar, while unipolar voltage is influenced by core and gray scar across the LV wall as defined by LGE-MRI.
