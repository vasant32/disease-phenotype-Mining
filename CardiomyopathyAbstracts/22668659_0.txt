Elevated cardiac troponin I can occur in patients with cardiac injury or sepsis. However, extreme elevations of serum cardiac troponin I in pediatric patients without myocardial injury are rare. We present a case of a 14-year-old girl involved in a motor vehicle accident with muscle injury, who was readmitted with sepsis and severely elevated serum cardiac troponin I level in the absence of myocardial injury.
