 OBJECTIVE: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) has been already linked to possible myocarditis and cardiomyopathy development. The brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) is a sensitive biomarker of left ventricular dysfunction. The present study aimed to evaluate the potential risk of cardiac injury in HIV-infected and HCV/HIV-coinfected patients with or without antiretroviral (ARV) therapy by comparing BNP serum levels in the groups studied. METHODS: Eighty HIV-infected patients (65 men, 15 women, mean age 40 years; 29 with HCV coinfection, 48 on combined ARV therapy) were included in the cross-sectional study. BNP serum levels were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The BNP cut-off level for possible heart failure was 42 fmol/l as in an immunocompetent population. RESULTS: Seventy-eight (97.5%) patients studied had a BNP concentration above 42 fmol/l; seven patients (8.7%) had a concentration above 168 fmol/l associated with a worse outcome. There was no difference in the mean BNP serum levels in ARV-treated and untreated patients. However, the mean BNP serum level was significantly higher in HCV/HIV-coinfected patients in comparison with HIV-monoinfected patients (160.0±130.9 vs. 81.9±37.2 fmol/l; P<0.0001). There was no relationship between BNP serum levels and HIV viral load, CD4 cell count, sex, age, and abacavir or protease inhibitors use. CONCLUSION: A significant association was found between HCV coinfection and BNP serum level in HIV-infected patients. HCV coinfection possibly enhances the risk of left ventricular dysfunction development in this vulnerable population.
