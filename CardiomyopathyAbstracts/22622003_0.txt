We present the case of a patient with dilated ischemic cardiomyopathy and severe mitral regurgitation. Due to several comorbidities, he underwent percutaneous transvenous mitral annuloplasty. Postoperatively, he complained of atypical chest pain. He was treated for pericarditis and died suddenly 10 days after the procedure. Autopsy showed distal perforation of the anterior interventricular vein with migration of the device on the diaphragm.
