Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging is widely established, free of radioactive material or ionizing radiation, and the accepted noninvasive gold standard for numerous noninvasive cardiac markers. Using a technique called T2-weighted imaging, CMR can be used to assess myocardial edema as a reliable marker for acute, potentially reversible myocardial injury. Contrast agents are not required as the myocardial free water content affects the magnetic properties of the tissue, thus providing inherent image contrast. In this review, we illustrate the utility of T2-weighted techniques in the assessment of myocardial edema in a range of clinical scenarios. The detection of myocardial edema is clinically relevant in many acute settings and may be further helpful to better understand the pathophysiology of many non-acute clinical diseases. Currently, T2-weighted CMR represents the only imaging modality that can accurately depict and quantify the presence of myocardial edema in a noninvasive fashion. Thus, T2-weighted imaging should be included in a comprehensive CMR imaging protocol, especially if an acute injury is suspected.
