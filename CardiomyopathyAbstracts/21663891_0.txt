A 61-year-old man has been implanted with a Ventritex Profile MD V-186 HV3 ICD for ischemic cardiomyopathy with sustained inducible VT. Three years later, this patient received several inappropriate shocks during the device's interrogation. These shocks provoked ventricular fibrillation. They were caused by a failing soldering between the system random accessory memory (SRAM) module and the hybrid circuit of the device. The device was explanted in emergency.
