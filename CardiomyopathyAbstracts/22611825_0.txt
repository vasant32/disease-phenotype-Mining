Constrictive pericarditis (CP) is a common disease with difficult diagnosis. We report a well-documented case of CP with extended pericardial calcification treated by total pericardiectomy. A brief review of symptoms and signs of CP is presented, as well as additional examination allowing the diagnosis to be confirmed. The differential diagnosis with restictive cardiomyopathy is also discussed.
