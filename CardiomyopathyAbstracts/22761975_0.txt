Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (also referred to as transient apical ballooning syndrome, broken heart syndrome or stress cardiomyopathy) is an increasingly recognized entity in the western world typically characterized by reversible left ventricular dysfunction that develops in the setting of acute severe emotional or physical stress. Increased catecholamine levels have been proposed to play a central role in the pathogenesis of the disease, although the specific pathophysiology of this condition remains elusive at the present moment. In recent times, there have been reports of takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TC) following medical interventions such as invasive or surgical procedures or specific medical regimens. In the current report, we present a patient with multiple recurrences of TC triggered by the same medical therapeutic intervention; in our particular case, repetitive exposure to inhaled beta-2-adrenoceptor agonist.
