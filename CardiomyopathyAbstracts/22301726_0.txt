Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is often transmitted to the offspring of affected individuals. This case report describes the role of genetic screening in a 39-year-old woman with a family history of sudden cardiac death. The patient wished to become pregnant and was seeking medical consultation. In addition to electro- and echocardiograms, genomic DNA was isolated and direct sequencing was employed to screen the patient for some of the most common genes that cause HCM. A pathogenic heterozygous mutation c.700 g > a p.Arg186Gln in TNNI3 was identified, which was not found in 200 normal control chromosomes. Mutation-specific genetic testing was also performed in four family members, and the same mutation was absent. Genetic screening appears cost effective in familiar members with a known mutation, provides important information about the affected individual, and can facilitate the future management of family members and offspring.
