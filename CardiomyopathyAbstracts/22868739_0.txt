This retrospective study to assess the role of hypertension in acute heart failure (HF) reviewed the case records of 86 patients, including 35 men (41%) and 51 women (59%), mean age 55.6Â±18 years, who were hospitalized for an acute exacerbation of HF. The cardiovascular risk factors considered were hypertension (56%), diabetes (8%), and smoking (13%); 11 patients were alcoholics (13%). HF was global in 71 cases (83%). Among the underlying heart diseases, hypertensive cardiomyopathy was noted in 22 patients (26%) and valvular disease in 17 patients (20%); the precise cause was not elucidated in 40 (47%). A decompensation factor was identified in 53 cases (62%). Among the patients admitted on an emergency basis for acute HF, the relative risk (RR) of severe hypertension (n = 41, 48%) was 3.75 (95% CI: 2.31 to 6.08, p&#60;0.0001), of heart rhythm disorder (n = 25 cases, 29%) 0.96 (95% CI 0.6 to 1.4, p = 0.5), and of poor adherence to standard treatment (n = 16, 18%) 2.2 (95% CI, 1.6 to 2.97, p&#60;0.0001). Other decompensation factors were severely impaired renal function in 8 cases (9%) and stroke and anemia in 6 cases each (7%).
