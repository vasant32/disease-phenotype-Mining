A 5-year-old girl developed cardiopulmonary arrest after crying. From the electrocardiogram and echocardiography, a left ventricular noncompaction (LVNC) with long QT syndrome (LQT) was suspected as the cause of the cardiopulmonary arrest, and treatment with a Î²-blocker and a calcium antagonist was then begun. A genetic screening of LQT-related genes revealed a previously reported heterozygous KCNQ1 mutation. The association of LVNC and LQT is an extremely rare condition, and long-term treatment based on the characteristics of both disorders is required. Also, the association of cardiomyopathy and LQT could become a new clinical entity in the future.
