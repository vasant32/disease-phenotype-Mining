 AIMS: Anthracyclines have profound consequences on the structure and function of the heart, which over time cause a cardiomyopathy that leads to congestive heart failure. Early detection of subclinical left ventricular (LV) dysfunction following a low dose of anthracyclines may be a preventive strategy. The aim of this study was to determine torsion analysis using two-dimensional speckle-tracking imaging (STI), useful for detecting early anthracycline-mediated cardiotoxicity. METHODS AND RESULTS: Conventional and Doppler echocardiography images were obtained from 25 patients (mean age 58 ± 11 years) before chemotherapy and 1 and 3 months after treatment. The cumulative anthracycline doses were 98 ± 59 and 170 ± 87 g/m(2) at 1 and 3 months, respectively. After standard echocardiography, LV torsion and twisting velocity profiles from apical and basal short-axis images were analysed using STI. LV dimensions and ejection fraction did not change throughout follow-up. Although isovolumic relaxation time showed prolongation 3 months after chemotherapy, other Doppler indices did not show significant changes. However, significant deteriorations in torsion (P < 0.0001 by ANOVA), twisting rate (P < 0.0001 by ANOVA), and untwisting rate (P < 0.001 by ANOVA) were found 1 month after chemotherapy. A significant negative correlation was observed between cumulative anthracycline doses and torsion (r = -0.524, P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: LV torsion analysis could be a useful non-invasive approach for early detection of subclinical anthracycline cardiotoxicity.
