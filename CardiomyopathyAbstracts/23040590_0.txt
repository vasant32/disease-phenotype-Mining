Little is known about left ventricular (LV) reverse remodeling (LVRR) in long-term survivors with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. We studied 59 patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy who had a potential clinical and echocardiographic follow-up period of >12 years. LVRR was defined as LV end-diastolic dimension ≤55 mm and fractional shortening ≥25% on the last echocardiogram. Of the 59 patients, 38 died (heart failure in 20, sudden death in 11, and other causes in 7), 2 underwent transplantation, and 19 survived. In the survivors, the LV size had significantly decreased and LV fractional shortening had significantly increased on the last echocardiogram. LVRR occurred in 37% of the survivors. The remaining 63% of the survivors still had LV dysfunction, but the LV end-systolic dimension had decreased significantly. In patients who died or underwent transplantation, the LV size significantly increased. No patient who died or underwent transplantation had LVRR. In conclusion, >60% of the long-term (>12 years) survivors with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy still had LV systolic dysfunction, but the LV end-systolic dimension had decreased significantly. In contrast, patients who died or underwent transplantation had significant LV enlargement. These results suggest that LVRR, even if it is not marked, is associated with a favorable prognosis.
