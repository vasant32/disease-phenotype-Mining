Tako-Tsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC) occurs particularly in post-menopausal women, being precipitated in many cases by severe emotional stress. We describe six patients in whom TTC occurred in association with therapeutic ingestion or overdose of the serotonin/noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor venlafaxine, or its metabolite desvenlafaxine. Importantly, two of the six cases were not post-menopausal women. An increased risk of TTC may account for some of the reported cardiovascular adverse effects of venlafaxine and similar agents.
