Background:Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is a form of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy that may be acutely precipitated by stress. A number of neurologic conditions have been implicated in precipitating this disease such as subarachnoid hemorrhage, stroke, and seizures. Its association with status migrainosus, however, has never been described before.Case:We report a case of a 25-year-old female presenting with status migrainosus followed by takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Supportive management was instituted in this patient and she made an excellent recovery.Conclusion:The intense pain associated with migraine may have acted as a stressor, thereby precipitating takotsubo cardiomyopathy. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case demonstrating a relationship between status migrainosus and takotsubo cardiomyopathy.
