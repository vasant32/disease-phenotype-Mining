Stress-induced cardiomyopathy (SICM) presenting as an acute myocardial dysfunction is characterized by transient left ventricular wall motion abnormality, which has been known to be associated with excessive catecholamine production caused due to various types of stress. Sympathetic hyperactivity is common during the perioperative period, and reports of SICM occurring during this period have actually increased. We present a case of SICM following negative pressure pulmonary edema due to upper airway obstruction during emergence from anesthesia. Excessive catecholamine release in response to respiratory difficulty could have been the underlying inciting factor.
