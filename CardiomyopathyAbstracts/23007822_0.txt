In this paper we present a rare case of Dacron patch closure of tear in right ventricular myocardial at outflow level, caused by stroke of hypoplastic right coronary artery occlusion, in patient with non-obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy caused by hypertension and aortic stenosis, surgically treated by implantation of mechanical prostheses, and pericarditis postcardiotomy. Our purpose is to trace evidence from postmortem identification of pathogenic mechanisms occurring in causing fatal event. The severe myocardial hypertrophy observed is supposedly based on valvular or hypertensive, is compatible with a significant reduction of the diastolic function and with the genesis of acute pulmonary edema as a trigger: the latter case may result in death for the reduction of contractile reserve of the right ventricle, induced by the presence of the patch surgically implanted.
