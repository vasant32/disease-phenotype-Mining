We report a pediatric case of successful cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) for acute relapsed deterioration of dilated cardiomyopathy with cardiac dyssynchrony due to a noncompacted left ventricle (LV). A 20-month-old female developed severe congestive heart failure, which was classified as New York Heart Association class IV. She failed to thrive despite intravenous inotropic support. Her LV function and dimension improved markedly after CRT. The beneficial effect of CRT in this patient has remained for more than 3 years.
