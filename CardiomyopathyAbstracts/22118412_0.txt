 OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess the performance of echocardiographic parameters to predict response to cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). BACKGROUND: CRT reduces morbidity and mortality due to the proper selection of candidates for CRT. METHODS: The 12-month trial was performed on 70 optimally medicated patients with standard inclusion criteria: NYHA class III or IV heart failure, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤ 35%, and QRS ≥ 120 ms. All parameters were evaluated by conventional and tissue Doppler-based methods. Indicator of positive CRT response was more than 20% in improvement of LVEF. RESULTS: LVEF increased >20% in 42 patients. Out of 43 tested baseline echocardiographic parameters, 12 showed statistical difference between responders and nonresponders. Out of these 12 parameters, six (LVSV, LVSI, LVFS, RVd, VPMR, and PISA) had modest to moderately good ability to predict LVEF response with sensitivity ranging from 62.2% to 82.4%, and specificity ranging from 56.5% to 81.2%. For those parameters, the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve for positive response to CRT was ≤0.76. Multivariate regression analysis resulted in selection of LVSI and LVFS as possible predictive independent parameters for a good response. The cutoff value for LVSI was 38.7 mL/m(2) (P = 0.045) and for LVFS was 13% (P = 0.032). CONCLUSIONS: Contribution of LVSI and LVFS is to be confirmed in larger trials. Simplicity of their assessment by conventional echocardiography could be an argument for adding them to the inclusion criteria for CRT in severe heart failure patients.
