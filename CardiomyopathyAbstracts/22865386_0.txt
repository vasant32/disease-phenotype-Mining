We previously reported that acute inhibition of the RhoA/Rho kinase (ROCK) pathway normalized contractile function of diabetic rat hearts, but the underlying mechanism is unclear. PKCβ(2) has been proposed to play a major role in diabetic cardiomyopathy at least in part by increasing oxidative stress. Further evidence suggests that PKC positively regulates RhoA expression through induction of iNOS in diabetes. However, in preliminary studies we found that inhibition of ROCK itself reduced RhoA expression in diabetic hearts. We hypothesized that there is an interaction between RhoA/ROCK and PKCβ(2) in the form of a positive feedback loop that sustains their activation and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). This was investigated in cardiomyocytes isolated from diabetic and control rat hearts, incubated with or without cytochalasin D or inhibitors of ROCK, RhoA, PKCβ(2) or iNOS. Inhibition of RhoA and ROCK markedly attenuated the diabetes-induced increases in PKCβ(2) activity and iNOS and RhoA expression in diabetic cardiomyocytes, while having no effect in control cells. Inhibition of PKCβ(2) and iNOS also normalized RhoA expression and ROCK overactivation, while iNOS inhibition reversed the increase in PKCβ(2) activity. Each of these treatments also normalized the diabetes-induced increase in production of ROS. Actin cytoskeleton disruption attenuated the increased expression and/or activity of all of these targets in diabetic cardiomyocytes. These data suggest that, in the diabetic heart, the RhoA/ROCK pathway contributes to contractile dysfunction at least in part by sustaining PKCβ(2) activation and ROS production via a positive feedback loop that requires an intact cytoskeleton.
