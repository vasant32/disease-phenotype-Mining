While blood pressure measurement methods in infants are well established, hypertension, a rare disease in this population, may still be revealed by heart failure. Kidney diseases are the most common causes of hypertension, prompting the search for a renovascular cause to start appropriate treatment. We report on 2 cases of late diagnosis of hypertension in infants, with hypertensive cardiomyopathy, one in the context of autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease and the other in the context of renal artery stenosis with hemodynamic disorder, hypertensive encephalopathy and neurological sequelae. In both cases, the equilibrium of blood pressure was difficult to achieve in the acute phase. Renal ultrasound is fundamental for diagnosis. The potential complications related to hypertension require early diagnosis, emphasizing the importance of measuring blood pressure during a routine consultation in infants.
