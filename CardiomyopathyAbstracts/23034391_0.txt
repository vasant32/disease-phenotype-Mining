Dysfunctional mitochondria are central in the pathogenesis of diabetic cardiomyopathy. Mitochondrial proteomic alterations resulting from diabetes mellitus have been reported though the mechanisms driving changes in proteomic signatures are unknown. miRNAs have been considered as potential regulators of proteins. The goal of this study was to determine whether miRNAs play a role in diabetes-induced mitochondrial proteomic alterations. RTQ-PCR miRNA screening in diabetic mice, five weeks following multiple low-dose streptozotocin treatment was associated with alteration in the expression of 29 miRNAs in the diabetic heart as compared to control. Among those miRNAs upregulated in the diabetic heart was miR-141 (p<0.002). miRNA target predication analyses identified miR-141 as a potential regulator of the inner mitochondrial membrane phosphate transporter, solute carrier family 25 member 3 (Slc25a3), which provides inorganic phosphate to the mitochondrial matrix and is essential for ATP production. Using a luciferase reporter construct with a Slc25a3 3'-UTR target sequence, overexpression of miR-141 down-regulated luciferase activity levels confirming miR-141/Slc25a3 3'-UTR binding. miR-141 overexpression in HEK 293 cells elicited a decrease in Slc25a3 protein content and a decrease in ATP synthase activity, similar to the diabetic phenotype (p<0.05, for both). Diabetic interfibrillar mitochondria (IFM) displayed decreased Slc25a3 protein content which was inversely correlated with increased miR-141 expression. Further, diabetic IFM ATP synthase activity was also decreased (p<0.05). Together these results indicate that miR-141 can regulate Slc25a3 protein expression in the diabetic heart. Further, diabetes-induced miRNA changes may influence mitochondrial proteomes and functional processes such as mitochondrial ATP production.
