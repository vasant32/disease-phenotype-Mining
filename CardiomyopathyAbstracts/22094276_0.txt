This report describes a 34-year-old male with the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome who presented with the unusual finding of a tachyarrhythmia-induced cardiomyopathy secondary to atrial flutter with 1:1 conduction through a left-lateral accessory pathway. Catheter ablation of the accessory connection resulted in complete normalization of cardiac function.
