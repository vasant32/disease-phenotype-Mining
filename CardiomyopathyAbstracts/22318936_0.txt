Coronary heart disease is still the leading cause of death in industrialized nations, occurring either as acute coronary occlusion and myocardial infarction or as chronic ischaemic cardiomyopathy caused by continuous obstruction of one or more coronary arteries. Even after successful reperfusion, an additional loss of otherwise vital cardiomyocytes may occur in the primary ischaemic area, called lethal reperfusion injury. In experimental settings, delivery of therapeutic agents targeting the reperfusion injury reduces the infarct size by 30%. In addition to the choice of therapeutic agent and time point, the mode of application may be crucial for the therapeutic success. Therefore, this review focuses on the current and future administration techniques for early and late post-myocardial infarction therapies.
