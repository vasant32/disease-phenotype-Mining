The Tako-Tsubo syndrome is a reversible form of an acute stress-related cardiomyopathy that was reported during the last decade. It typically presents with a constellation of symptoms, electrocardiographic changes, and elevated cardiac enzyme levels consistent with an acute coronary syndrome. However, when the patient undergoes cardiac angiography, left ventricular apical ballooning finding is seen, but no significant coronary artery stenosis. This balloon-like morphology, being the hallmark of this entity, can be detected by imaging. We present a case report of a patient who was admitted to our hospital and met all the diagnostic criteria of the Tako-Tsubo syndrome. Myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) showed an anteroapical perfusion defect at rest, moderated systolic dysfunction, and intraventricular asynchrony all assessed by gated-SPECT phase analysis. Two months later, all MPI findings returned to normal parameters.
