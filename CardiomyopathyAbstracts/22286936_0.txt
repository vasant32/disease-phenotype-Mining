A 69-year-old woman reported that underwent endonasal frontal sinus surgery under general anesthesia. In her medical history the patient reports a multiple occurrence of angina pectoris attacks, especially in stressful situations. Coronary heart disease has so far been excluded. At preoperative presentation of this patient was in good general and nutritional state. Intraoperative hypotension had to be treated with norepinephrine. In the recovery room, the patient developed angina pectoris symptoms and the ECG showed T negativity. The patient was admitted on an ICU. Coronary angiography showed left ventricular apical ballooning with a transient akinesia typical of the left ventricle, as is seen in a Tako-Tsubo syndrome. The symptoms are similar to acute coronary artery disease, but without stenosis of coronary arteries. Physical or emotional stress is known to trigger Tako-Tsubo Syndrome, but the exact etiology or pathophysiology remains somewhat unclear.
