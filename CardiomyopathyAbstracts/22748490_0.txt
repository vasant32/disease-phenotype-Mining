 BACKGROUND: Clinical multistage risk assessment associated with electrocardiogram (ECG) and NT-proBNP may be a feasible strategy to screen hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). We investigated the effectiveness of a screening based on ECG and NT-proBNP in first-degree relatives of patients with HCM. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 106 first-degree relatives were included. All individuals were evaluated by echocardiography, ECG, NT-proBNP, and molecular screening (available for 65 individuals). From the 106 individuals, 36 (34%) had diagnosis confirmed by echocardiography. Using echocardiography as the gold standard, ECG criteria had a sensitivity of 0.71, 0.42, and 0.52 for the Romhilt-Estes, Sokolow-Lyon, and Cornell criteria, respectively. Mean values of NT-ProBNP were higher in affected as compared with nonaffected relatives (26.1 vs. 1290.5, P < .001). The AUC of NT-proBNP was 0.98. Using a cutoff value of 70 pg/mL, we observed a sensitivity of 0.92 and specificity of 0.96. Using molecular genetics as the gold standard, ECG criteria had a sensitivity of 0.67, 0.37, and 0.42 for the Romhilt-Estes, Sokolow-Lyon, and Cornell criteria, respectively. Using a cutoff value of 70 pg/mL, we observed a sensitivity of 0.83 and specificity of 0.98. CONCLUSION: Values of NT-proBNP above 70 pg/mL can be used to effectively select high-risk first-degreeÂ relatives for HCM screening.
