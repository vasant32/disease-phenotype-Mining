We examined clinical outcomes based on ethnicity in patients undergoing left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation. We hypothesized that treatment in a specialized, comprehensive heart failure program results in similar survival between African Americans and whites. We retrospectively reviewed patient data implanted with HeartMate II (HM-II) LVAD over 2 years. There were 79 patients: 34 (43%) whites, 33 (42%) African Americans, and 12 (15%) patients belonging to other ethnicities there was no difference in demographics. The etiology of cardiomyopathy was more commonly ischemic in white patients compared to nonischemic in African American patients (p = 0.01). The mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 22.21 ± 10.66% in African American patients and 15.21 ± 5.54% in white patients (p = 0.008). The left ventricular end-diastolic (p = 0.06) and end-systolic (p = 0.03) diameters were greater in white patients compared to African American patients. Hypertension was seen in 79% of African American patients compared to 56% in white patients (p = 0.07). Survival by Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed an unadjusted survival advantage in African American patients (p = 0.04 by log-rank test), but this survival advantage was lost in multivariable Cox regression analysis after adjustment for other covariates. There was no difference in readmissions (p = 0.36). In patients with advanced heart failure undergoing HM-II LVAD implantation, African American patients had a similar survival and no difference in readmissions when compared with white patients despite significant differences in baseline clinical characteristics.
