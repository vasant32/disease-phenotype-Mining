 BACKGROUND: Mitral valve surgery for functional ischemic mitral regurgitation (MR) in high-risk patients, including those requiring multiple concomitant cardiac operations, carries a significant risk of morbidity and mortality. In patients undergoing surgical ventricular restoration, transventricular edge-to-edge repair provides an effective alternative to conventional mitral valve surgery. We report such a case. METHODS: A 67-year-old male with ischemic cardiomyopathy and severe left ventricular dysfunction presented to our institution with a 3-month history of dyspnea on exertion, angina, and leg edema. He was found to have triple-vessel coronary artery disease, a severely dilated left ventricle with an apical aneurysm, and moderate-to-severe MR (3+). In addition to coronary artery bypass graft surgery, an edge-to-edge mitral valve repair was undertaken via a longitudinal ventriculotomy performed for concomitant surgical ventricular restoration. RESULTS: Total cardiopulmonary bypass and aortic cross-clamp times were 101 minutes and 86 minutes, respectively. Postoperative transesophageal echocardiography revealed no MR, and the patient was discharged home on postoperative day 9. A follow-up transthoracic echocardiogram revealed trace MR on postoperative day 15. At 11 months postoperative, the patient remains in New York Heart Association functional class I. CONCLUSION: Transventricular edge-to-edge repair of the mitral valve in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy and functional MR undergoing SVR is a safe and effective alternative to conventional valve surgery, and should be considered in this high-risk population.
