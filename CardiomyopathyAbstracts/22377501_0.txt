 INTRODUCTION: Cardiac arrest in the perioperative setting is an extremely serious event that is estimated to occur between 4.6 and 19.7 per 10,000 anesthetics.(1-5) While risk factors for cardiac complications can be identified pre- operatively, in many cases workup of risk factors are not indicated by standard pre-operative testing guidelines. PRESENTATION OF CASE: We present a case of a 47-year-old female undergoing an elective bilateral mastectomy who suddenly converted to ventricular fibrillation. While ventricular fibrillation is not a unique finding, our search for its etiology revealed two previously undiagnosed cardiac conditions, and possible electro- cautery induced ventricular fibrillation. DISCUSSION: In this case study, we discuss the possible etiology of ventricular fibrillation in our patient and highlight the importance pre-operative patient investigation and history provide. CONCLUSION: Searching for the potential causes that may have contributed to the cardiac arrest is an extremely useful exercise as it allows us to better prepare patients pre-operatively, improve intra-operative care, and prevent future cardiac events.
