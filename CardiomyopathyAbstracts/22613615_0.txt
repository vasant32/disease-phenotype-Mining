Left ventricular hypertrophy associated with the use of tacrolimus is a rare complication of solid organ transplantation in adult recipients. We present a cardiac transplant recipient who developed severe concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with congestive heart failure related to myocardial hypertrophy on tacrolimus. Hypertrophy improved when the drug was discontinued and replaced with sirolimus.
