Noncompaction cardiomyopathy, a rare congenital cardiomyopathy, is characterized by increased trabeculation in one or more segments of the ventricle. The coexistence of other cardiac anomalies such as coronary-cameral fistula, bicuspid aortic valve, ventricular septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus and bradyarrhythmias make noncompaction cardiomyopathy resemble the reptile heart. The defect in myocardial compaction and the frequently seen accompanying anomalies may share a common causative factor during embryogenesis.
