This report describes a transient hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with right-ventricle outlet tract obstruction (RVOTO) induced by perinatal stress due to a major surgical procedure in a female newborn with congenital abnormalities. On day 10, she presented with heart failure, abnormal B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), and an echocardiogram showing normal wall thickness. An in-hospital follow-up echocardiogram showed biventricular hypertrophy and RVOTO. At discharge, the infant was asymptomatic, with a normal echocardiogram and BNP. Transient RVOTO triggered by surgical stress and abnormal BNP have not been reported previously. Pathophysiology, the role of BNP, and clinical characteristics are discussed.
