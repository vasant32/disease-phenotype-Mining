Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and N-terminal brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) are important biomarkers for pediatric cardiovascular diseases. Peptide levels are associated with age and gender. Current studies have shown that BNP and NT-proBNP are valuable in the diagnosis of heart failure, with a high specificity and sensitivity. They also contribute to differentiating heart failure from acute respiratory distress induced by simple pulmonary factors. In addition, BNP and NT-proBNP are useful in the evaluation of disease severity and treatment guidance in children with pulmonary hypertension, cardiomyopathy and Kawasaki disease. Current limitations include the relatively small sample size of the study, the detection method and a range of normal values that are not completely uniform.
