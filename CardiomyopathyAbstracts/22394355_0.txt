The main determinant of survival in amyloid light chain amyloidosis is cardiac involvement. The rate of change in wall thickness may be a strong predictor of survival. After treatment, some hematologic responders have had documented regression of wall thickness by echocardiography with resolution of heart failure symptoms. Herein, we demonstrate a case of treated immunoglobulin light chain cardiac amyloidosis with echocardiographic wall thinning and cardiac biopsies demonstrating complete histologic remission. This observation suggests a mechanism of treatment response and that with appropriately timed treatment, cardiac deposition of amyloid fibrils can be completely reversed.
