In this report, the clinical characteristics of a 65-year-old female patient with tricuspid regurgitation, ischemic cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure, and chronic renal failure were retrospectively evaluated. Laboratory studies revealed cardiogenic ascites coincided with nephrogenic ascites and subclinical amiodarone-induced hypothyroidism. The ascites of the patient was responsive to management of congestive heart failure and therapeutic paracentesis during the first episode, add-on therapy with intensified hemodialysis during the second episode, and add-on therapy with low-dose eltroxin during the third episode. When nephrogenic ascites and cardiogenic ascites of maintenance hemodialysis patients become refractory, hypothyroidism should be examined in these patients.
