In the setting of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus, the ectopic disposition of lipids may be a cause of heart failure. Clinical studies have clearly shown a correlation between the accumulation of triglycerides and heart dysfunction. In this process, it is likely that there are also changes in the contents of sphingolipids. Sphingolipids are important structural and signaling molecules. One specific sphingolipid, ceramide, may cause cardiac dysfunction, whereas another, sphingosine 1-phosphate, is cardioprotective. In this review, the authors focus on the role of sphingolipids in the development and prevention of cardiac failure.
