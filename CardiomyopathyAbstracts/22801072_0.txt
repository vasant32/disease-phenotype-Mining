 BACKGROUND: Chronic heart failure (CHF) is a major and growing public health problem resulting from the cardiac damage caused by a variety of disease processes. CHF has many comorbid conditions such as hypertension, coronary artery disease, peripheral artery disease and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Some of the chronic conditions may have an effect on cardiac mortality in CHF patients. We have investigated the effect of renal dysfunction on cardiovascular mortality in patients with ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and nonischemic DCM. METHODS: Six hundred and thirty-seven patients with DCM were evaluated between January 2003 and January 2011. All individuals in the study population were admitted to the cardiology clinic because of decompensated heart failure. In this prospective observational study, a total of 637 patients [409 men, 228 women, 18-94 years old, mean age 63 ± 13 years; New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class II-IV] with diagnoses of ischemic (402) and nonischemic (235) DCM were enrolled in the study. Baseline glomerular filtration rate was calculated using the Cockcroft-Gault equation. RESULTS: By the end of the study, 228 patients had died due to cardiovascular reasons. Both DCM types had similar cardiovascular mortality [151 patients with ischemic DCM (37%) vs. 77 patients with nonischemic DCM (32%); P = NS]. Renal dysfunction had an effect on cardiovascular mortality in patients with ischemic and nonischemic DCM (respectively, glomerular filtration rate 54 ± 24, 56 ± 24; P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: We have demonstrated that renal function is a prognostic risk marker in patients with ischemic and nonischemic DCM.
