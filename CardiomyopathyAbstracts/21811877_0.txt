With the introduction of targeted coronary artery angiography to post-mortem computed tomography (PMCT) it is now possible to assess the coronary arteries and left ventricle after death without, case dependent, the necessity to undertake an invasive autopsy. The purpose of this pictorial review is to act as a walk through aid memoire and educational learning document for radiologists and pathologists alike who may be new to the use and interpretation of targeted PMCT angiography. By using an example scanning protocol, which uses both positive and negative (air) contrast mediums, this pictorial review provides a systematic approach to vessel and ventricular assessment that is based upon clinical cardiac angiography but adapted to PMCT.
