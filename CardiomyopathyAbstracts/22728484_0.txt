Intramyocardial calcification is a very rare condition. We report a case of a 72-year-old man with apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, who was initially suspected of having a thrombus in the left ventricular apex on echocardiography, but was finally diagnosed as having apical intramyocardial calcification on multidetector computed tomography. The mechanism of developing intramyocardial calcification remains to be elucidated, but the patient has been stable for more than 2 years.
