OBJECTIVE: Progressive cardiomyopathy is a major cause of death in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) patients. Coupling between Ca(2+) handling and contractile properties in dystrophic hearts is poorly understood. It is also not clear whether developing cardiac failure is dominated by alterations in Ca(2+) pathways or more related to the contractile apparatus. METHODS: We simultaneously recorded force and Ca(2+) transients in field-stimulated papillary muscles from young (10 - 14 wks) wild-type (wt) and dystrophic mdx mice. RESULTS: Force amplitudes were five-fold reduced in mdx muscles despite only 30 % reduction in fura-2 ratio amplitudes. This indicated mechanisms other than systolic Ca(2+) to additionally account for force decrements in mdx muscles. pCa-force relations revealed decreased mdx myofibrillar Ca(2+) sensitivity. 'In vitro' motility assays, studied in mdx hearts here for the first time, showed significantly slower sliding velocities. mdx MLC/MHC isoforms were not grossly altered. Dystrophic hearts showed echocardiography signs of early ventricular wall hypertrophy with a significantly enlarged end-diastolic diameter 'in vivo'. However, fractional shortening was still comparable to wt mice. Changes in the contractile apparatus satisfactorily explained force drop in mdx hearts. CONCLUSIONS: We give first evidence of early hypertrophy in mdx mice and possible mechanisms for already functional impairment of cardiac muscle in DMD. © 2012 The Authors Journal of Cellular and Molecular Medicine © 2012 Foundation forCellular and Molecular Medicine/Blackwell Publishing Ltd.
