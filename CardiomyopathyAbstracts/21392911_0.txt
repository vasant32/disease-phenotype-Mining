Our purpose is to discuss MRI findings in non-ischemic myocardial disease (NIMD). Emphasis is placed on the typical locations and patterns of delayed enhancement. Clinicopathological and MRI features of amyloidosis, arrythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia, left ventricular non-compaction, myocarditis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and dilated cardiomyopathy are discussed. Currently, cardiac MRI is the best imaging method for diagnosis and follow-up of NIMD. In particular, the radiologist should be familiar with the different patterns of delayed enhancement on DE-CMR since they play an important role in the detection and differential diagnosis of NIMD.
