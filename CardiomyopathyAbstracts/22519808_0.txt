Cardiac sodium channel dysfunction associated with the SCN5A gene presents with mixed phenotypes, including long QT syndrome type 3, sinus node dysfunction, and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). We report a Korean case of an overlap syndrome of cardiac sodium channelopathy with SCN5A p.R1193Q polymorphism, treated by the placement of an intrapericardial implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) at the age of 27 months. Although the patient received two appropriate life-saving shocks for ventricular fibrillations, he eventually died of DCM progression. However, this case shows that intrapericardial ICD implantation is feasible in young children with a high risk for sudden cardiac death.
