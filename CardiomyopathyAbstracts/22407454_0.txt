Most commonly, arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (also known as arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, or ARVC) is caused by mutations in desmosomal proteins. The question arises as to the mechanisms by which mutations in mechanical junctions, affect the rhythm of the heart. We have proposed that a component of the arrhythmogenic substrate may include changes in the function of both, gap junctions and sodium channels. Here, we review the relevant literature on this subject.
