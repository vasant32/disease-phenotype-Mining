Sarcoidosis is a multisystemic granulomatous disease of unknown etiology. We report an unusual case of sarcoidosis in a woman presenting with cardiac sarcoidosis and massive splenomegaly with a familial history of cardiac sarcoidosis. Cardiac sarcoidosis was diagnosed based on electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, 18F-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18F-FDG-PET) and skin histological findings. We performed splenectomy to rule out malignant lymphoma, and histological findings confirmed sarcoidosis. After splenectomy, we initiated prednisolone therapy. After 20 months of diagnosis, she was symptom free. Echocardiography and 18F-FDG-PET may be a key diagnostic tool and prednisolone therapy may be safe, effective, and feasible for cardiac sarcoidosis.
