Vitamin C (Vit C) has been shown to be protective against doxorubicin (Dox)-induced cardiotoxicity. However, Vit C uptake into cardiomyocytes is poorly understood. Furthermore, whether the antioxidant enzyme reserve is enhanced by Vit C is also not known. The present study investigated an influence of Dox on Vit C transporters, expression of endogenous antioxidant reserve as well as enzymes, oxidative stress, and apoptosis in isolated cardiomyocytes. Cardiomyocytes isolated from adult Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to control (culture medium 199 alone), Dox (10 μM), Vit C (25 μM), and Vit C + Dox for 24 h. Vit C transporter expression and localization, oxidative stress, antioxidant enzymes, and apoptosis were studied. Expression and localization of sodium-dependent vitamin C transporter-2 (SVCT-2) in the sarcolemma was reduced by Dox, but Vit C supplementation was able to blunt this change. There was a decrease in the expression of antioxidant enzymes glutathione peroxidase (GPx), catalase, and Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD) due to Dox, but only GPx expression was completely prevented and Cu/Zn SOD was partially rescued by Vit C. Dox-induced decrease in antioxidant reserve and increase in oxidative stress were partially mitigated by Vit C. Dox-induced apoptosis was ameliorated by Vit C. It is suggested that cardioprotection offered by Vit C in Dox-induced cardiomyopathy may involve an upregulation of SVCT-2 transporter followed by a reduction in oxidative stress as well as blunting of cardiomyocyte injury.
