A 40-year-old gentleman previously fit and well presented to hospital on Christmas day in 2003 with dyspnoea, indigestion and 'pins and needles' down his left arm. Investigations in the emergency department were normal, so the patient was discharged from hospital with a diagnosis of panic attacks. A month later he re-presented to hospital, again with an indigestion-like pain in the chest, worsening dyspnoea, poor exercise tolerance and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea. Myocardial infarction was diagnosed, as well as dilated cardiomyopathy. The patient was subsequently put on the heart transplant register. First he had a pacemaker put in, and 4 months later a defibrillator was inserted which dramatically improved the patient's signs and symptoms. He felt well in himself for 7 years; however began to deteriorate in August 2010. No heart transplants were available at the time, so the patient was offered a ventricular assist device in September 2010. The patient went into kidney failure in December 2010 and haemodialysis was commenced in January 2011. He is currently at home awaiting a double heart and kidney transplant.
