The outlook for patients with TM and other transfusion dependent anemias has improved substantially with the availability of three iron chelating drugs and the use of T2* MRI to detect cardiac siderosis before cardiac symptoms develop. Combined therapy with DFO and DFP has proved particularly effective at treating a previously fatal iron induced cardiomyopathy. In the UK, infection rather than iron induced cardiomyopathy is now the main cause of mortality in TM (23). It seems likely that patient preference and compliance will result in the increased use of the oral chelators and corresponding reduced use of subcutaneous DFO. Randomised trials of oral chelators against DFO may become more difficult to perform because of patient preference. This will be particularly so if a third orally active iron chelator becomes clinically available. With each drug alone, however, a proportion of patients, perhaps 20%, will be inadequately chelated because of lack of efficacy or because the drug dosage has to be reduced or stopped because of side-effects. Switching chelators and combination therapy of the oral chelators is likely to increase in use so a randomized trial of the two oral chelators DFP and DFX in combination against alternative chelation regimens is urgently needed.
