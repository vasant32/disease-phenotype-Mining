Pharmacologic therapy is the first line approach to relieve symptoms in obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. There are no randomized trials to evaluate their effect on prognosis. Gradient reduction by surgical septal myectomy is associated with excellent prognosis, but not all patients have symptoms severe enough to require surgery; and, guidelines recommend operation only for patients with high gradients and symptoms unresponsive to pharmacologic therapy. The combination of disopyramide and beta-blockade is effective in reducing resting gradients (though not to the extent of surgery). This review examines the question of whether pharmacologic reduction of gradient in asymptomatic patients or those with milder symptoms might decrease HCM-related mortality.
