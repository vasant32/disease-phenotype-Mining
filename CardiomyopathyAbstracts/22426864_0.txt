The objective of the present study is to observe the effect of Astragalus polysaccharide (APS) on myocardial glucose and lipid metabolism in diabetes (DM) hamster and to explore its mechanism in intervention of DM cardiomyopathy. Low-dose- streptozotocin-induced hamsters (STZ, 40 mg/kg × 3 days, i.p.) with blood glucose >13.9 mmo/L were considered as type 2 diabetic models. We measure blood glucose, serum lipid, insulin, C-peptide, myocardial enzyme levels, myocardial glycogen staining, myocardial ultrastructure, fluorescence quantitative RT-PCR detection of myocardial PPAR-α and the target genes (FATP, ACS) and GLUT4 mRNA expression in normal control group, DM group and APS treatment group hamsters. There was significant glycolipid metabolic disorders in DM group compared with normal group. Glucose, glycosylated serum protein, myocardial enzymes and lipid levels in APS treatment group decreased significantly than DM group, but insulin and C-peptide levels was no difference. Myocardial glycogen staining and abnormal myocardial ultrastructure in APS treatment group were significantly improved than in DM group. Gene expression of myocardial PPAR-α and its target genes (FATP, ACS) in APS group were significantly lower than in DM group, while gene expression of GLUT4 in APS group was higher than DM group. APS can partially improve myocardial glucose and lipid metabolism disorders in diabetic hamsters and protect myocardium in some extent.
