Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a rare presenting feature of congenital disorder of glycosylation type Ia (CDG-Ia). We report two female siblings with CDG-Ia and cardiomyopathy. Patient no. 1 died at 12 days of age from cardiac rupture and tamponade, which has not previously been reported in CDG-Ia. The second patient died at 2 months of age from HCM. The severe cardiac manifestations seen in our patients emphasize the importance of early cardiac assessment in all patients with CDG-Ia.
