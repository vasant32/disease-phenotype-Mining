 OBJECTIVE: Conventional scales may help with the identification of depression but are generally too lengthy for clinical practice and perform poorly against anxiety and distress. We therefore examined the value of a single item NCCN Distress Thermometer and an enhanced visual-analogue method (Emotion Thermometers, ET) that incorporates four emotion thermometers. METHODS: We examined 228 patients with mixed cardiovascular conditions of whom 200 completed questionnaires. 64.5% suffered from cardiomyopathy/congestive heart failure, 9.5% had coronary artery disease, 4.5% had multiple cardiac diagnoses, 3% suffered from hypertension, 2% had rhythm problem, 2% had valve problems and 1.5% were diagnosed with atrial fibrillation. We used DSM-IV criteria to define current depression, the GAD7 to define current anxiety and the HADS-T to define distress. 13% had DSM-IV MDD and 19.1% had major or minor depression using DSM-IV (any depression). There were also 59 people (29.6%) with clinically significant distress and 46 with clinically significant anxiety (23.1%). RESULTS: The optimal accuracy for major depression was either the Depression thermometer (DepT) or the Help thermometer (HelpT), as both performed well. They had a sensitivity and specificity of 73.1%, 89.7% and 84.6%, 85.6%, respectively. The DepT was also best for detecting any DSM-IV depression (sensitivity 68.4% and specificity 93.2%) and HAD-T based distress (sensitivity 79.7% and specificity 82.9%). The Anxiety thermometer (AnxT) performed best against the GAD7 (sensitivity 84.8% and specificity 83.7%). CONCLUSION: Innovative visual-analogue screening tools for mood appear to perform well in cardiovascular settings.
