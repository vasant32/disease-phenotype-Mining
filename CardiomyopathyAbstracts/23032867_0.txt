BACKGROUND: The approval of an entirely subcutaneous implantable-cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) system (S-ICD(®)) has raised attention about this promising technology. It has been developed to overcome lead failure and infection problems of conventional transvenous ICD systems. Nevertheless, lead migration of the initial design and inappropriate shock rates have raised concerns on its reliability and safety. We report the so far largest multicenter series of patients with the new device in comparison to a matched conventional transvenous ICD collective with focus on perioperative complications, conversion of induced ventricular fibrillation (VF), and short-term follow-up. METHODS AND RESULTS:: 69 patients (50 male, 19 female, mean age 45.7±15.7 years) received an S-ICD(®) in three German centers and were randomly assigned to 69 sex and age matched conventional ICD patients. The indication was primary prevention in 41 patients (59.4%) without difference between groups (34 control patients, p=0.268). The predominant underlying heart disease was ischemic cardiomyopathy in 11 (15.9%), dilated cardiomyopathy in 25 (36.2%), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in 10 patients (14.5%) in the S-ICD(®) group. The mean implantation time was 70.8±27.9 minutes (p=0.398). Conversion rates of induced ventricular fibrillation were 89.5% for 65 Joules (15J safety-margin) and 95.5% including reversed shock polarity (15J safety-margin) in the study group. Termination of induced ventricular fibrillation was successful in 90.8% (10J safety-margin device dependant) of the control patients (p=0.815). Procedural complications were similar between the two groups. The mean follow-up is 217±138 days. During follow-up, three patients with S-ICD(®) were appropriately treated for ventricular arrhythmias. Three inappropriate episodes occurred (5.2%) in three S-ICD(®) patients due to T-wave oversensing, whereas atrial fibrillation with rapid conduction was the predominant reason for inappropriate therapy in conventional devices (p=0.745). CONCLUSION: The novel S-ICD(®) system could safely be implanted with similar perioperative adverse events compared to standard transvenous devices. Our case-control study demonstrates a 10.4% failure of conversion of induced VF with the S-ICD(®) set to standard polarity and a 15J safety margin and comparable inappropriate shock rates in a short-term follow-up.
