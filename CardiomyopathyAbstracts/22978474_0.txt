Abstract Aim: To describe the natural history, management and outcomes of peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) in an unselected Northern European population. Methods: A retrospective single-centre observational study was performed at a tertiary referral heart failure and transplantation unit. Outcomes measured were baseline demographics, clinical presentation, course and treatment. Echocardiographic findings were compared at baseline, two and six months. Results: 12 cases of PPCM were identified between 2002 and 2008. Mean age was 34.7years. Nine patients were multiparous and nine had pre-eclampsia. Ten presented in the first week postpartum. Two required inotropic support. Mean ejection fraction at presentation was 27.1% (SD-8.2%) which improved to 47.1% (SD-13.2%) at six months. At this time ten patients were asymptomatic and six had recovered normal cardiac function. Left ventricular (LV) function improved but did not reach normal limits in five cases. One case with persistent severe LV dysfunction required cardiac transplantation. One patient suffered an arrhythmic death several years after the six month follow-up period. Conclusions: PPCM is a rare condition. With appropriate therapy, a good clinical outcome is common but not universal. Continued deterioration requiring ventricular support and cardiac transplantation can occur. In our cohort, older maternal age, multiparity and pre-eclampsia appeared to be risk factors.
