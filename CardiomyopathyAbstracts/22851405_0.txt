Systolic anterior motion of mitral anterior leaflet is a serious clinical condition and it is hard to control medically. Alfieri edge-to-edge repair has been thought one of the useful techniques to improve abnormal anterior systolic motion with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy. Here, we present a 71-year-old lady who had the left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, severe mitral valve regurgitation with systolic anterior motion. The patient had a history of aortic valve replacement 5Â years ago. She was successfully treated with transaortic edge-to-edge mitral valve plasty and myectomy of the left ventricle. Postoperative course was uneventful.
