We present a unique case of a patient, aged 80 years, who presented with delirium and takotsubo syndrome. Also known as "broken heart syndrome" because it often originates following an emotional stress, takotsubo syndrome may be difficult to distinguish from myocardial infarction because of similar symptoms and demographics. However, the distinction of these opposing diagnoses is significant because takotsubo syndrome is associated with more favorable prognosis for complete recovery, especially with early diagnosis and expedient supportive therapy. To our knowledge, we present the first case of takotsubo syndrome in which the diagnosis was made in an elderly patient presenting with delirium and in the absence of the hallmark symptoms of chest pain and dyspnea. Finally, we describe this patient's coexistent diagnosis of polymyalgia rheumatica and speculate on its possible theoretic relationship to takotsubo syndrome.
