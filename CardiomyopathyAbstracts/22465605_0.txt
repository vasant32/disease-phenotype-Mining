 INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Molecular characterization of congenital heart diseases now includes the not infrequent dysmorphic Noonan syndrome. A study of 6 genes of the RAS-MAPK pathway in Spanish patients is presented: the impact of heart disease, clinical expressivity, and diagnostic yield are investigated. METHODS: The study included 643 patients (and 182 family members) diagnosed by dysmorphologists, cardiologists, and pediatric endocrinologists from 74 tertiary hospitals. Bidirectional sequencing analysis of PTPN11, SOS1, RAF1, BRAF, KRAS and HRAS focused on exons carrying recurrent mutations accounting for 80% to 95% of previously described mutations. RESULTS: Mutations were detected in 230 patients (91 women and 139 men) in 200 (31%) families (172 PTPN11+, 14 SOS1+, 9 RAF1+, 5 BRAF+). There was specific reference to the heart defect suffered in 156 index cases: 103 patients had shown pulmonary stenosis, 12 pulmonary stenosis with hyperthrophic cardiomyopathy, 18 hypertrophic cardiomiopathy, and 14 other cardiopathies; heart disease was absent in 9 index cases. Heart disease had not been documented in 23 of 30 family members with positive genotype and compatible clinical signs. Diagnostic yield was higher (P=.016) for samples from some centers (53%; 14/32) and even from certain professionals (64%; 9/14; P=.019). Characterization rate was 18% in patients for whom clinical data were not available. Genotyping led to a more precise diagnosis in 26 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Most patients (94%) with a positive genotype had known congenital heart disease, 79% pulmonary stenosis and 12% hyperthrophic cardiomyopathy. Cardiopathy had not been documented in 76% of family members carrying the mutation. Molecular study is a useful tool in these syndromes but a more rigorous clinical diagnosis should be intended as well.
