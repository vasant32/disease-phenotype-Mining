The present study assessed the usefulness of brain natriuretic peptide in evaluating the cardiovascular status in children and grown-ups with congenital or acquired disease affected by chronic cardiac failure. Brain natriuretic peptide should be included in the risk stratification of children with dilated cardiomyopathy. In patients with congenital heart defects, it is useful to tailor the optimal medical strategy to individual patients.
