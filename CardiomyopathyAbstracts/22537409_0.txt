A considerable number of patients with advanced cirrhosis develop a hepatorenal syndrome. The pathogenesis involves liver dysfunction, splanchnic vasodilatation, and activation of vasoconstrictive systems. There are now several observations that indicate a relation between the renal failure and impaired cardiac function in patients with advanced cirrhosis. Cirrhotic cardiomyopathy has been described as a condition with impaired contractile responsiveness to stress and altered diastolic relaxation. We propose a cardiorenal interaction in patients with advanced cirrhosis and renal dysfunction that refers to a condition where cardiac dysfunction in cirrhosis is a major determinant of kidney function and survival. Thus, the relation between cardiac dysfunction and renal insufficiency should be target for future studies and development of new treatments should focus on ameliorating the cardiac dysfunction.
