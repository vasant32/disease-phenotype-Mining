BACKGROUND: Implantable defibrillator (ICD) studies in patients with coronary artery disease report higher risk of VT/VF early post-implant, potentially related to local pro-arrhythmic effects of ICD leads. OBJECTIVE: To characterize early and long-term risk of ICD discharge for VT/VF in a large hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) cohort. METHODS: Using HCM multicenter registry data, we compared long-term risk of VT/VF subsequent to an early post-implant period (a priori defined at 3 months) between patients with or without VT/VF within 3 months after ICD implantation. RESULTS: Over a median follow-up of 4.3 years, 109/506 (22%) HCM patients with ICDs received at least one ICD discharge for VT/VF. Risk of first ICD discharge for VT/VF was highest in the first year post-implant (10.8%/person-year, 95%CI:7.9-13.8), and particularly in the first 3 months (17.0%/person-year, 95%CI:9.8-24.3). Patients with early VT/VF (≤3 months post-implant) were older, and more commonly had secondary prevention ICDs following cardiac arrest or systolic dysfunction (end-stage HCM with ejection fraction <50%). Only 2/247 (0.7%) patients with primary prevention ICDs and preserved systolic function had early VT/VF. Patients with VT/VF early post-implant (≤ 3 months) had more than 5-fold higher risk for future VT/VF during long-term follow-up compared to patients without early VT/VF (adjusted HR 5.4; 95%CI:2.3-12.6). CONCLUSION: High-risk HCM patients with VT/VF early after ICD implantation are particularly prone to subsequent VT/VF throughout follow-up. Early ICD interventions for VT/VF are largely confined to patients with prior cardiac arrest or systolic dysfunction and therefore more likely driven by higher arrhythmic risk rather than lead-related proarrhythmia.
