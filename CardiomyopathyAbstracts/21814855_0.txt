The calcium channel may be an important target in the autoimmune pathogenesis of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). The presence and function of serum autoantibodies against calcium channels (CC-AAbs) in patients with DCM were studied. Calcium-channel AAbs were detected in 80 patients with DCM and 80 controls by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Calcium-channel AAbs were further purified by affinity chromatography for characterization by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence. Voltage-clamp experiments were performed to identify the function of CC-AAbs. The presence of CC-AAbs was shown effectively by ELISA, and CC-AAbs were able specifically to bind to the calcium channel on the myocyte, confirmed by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence. Calcium currents were enhanced by CC-AAbs on Xenopus oocytes expressing human Ca(V)1.2 channels, which suggested CC-AAbs in patients with DCM were agonist-like. Our results suggest there are novel agonist-like CC-AAbs in patients with DCM. Calcium-channel AAbs might play an important role in the pathogenesis of DCM.
