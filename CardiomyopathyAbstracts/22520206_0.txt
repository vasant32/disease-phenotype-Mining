Cobaltism related to athroplasty implants has been anecdotally documented in at least six cases presenting with a combination of neurological, endocrine and cardiac symptoms with improvement in most symptoms after revision. Causality however has not been well established. This report documents the case of a 75 year-old male farmer who presents with possible cobalt cardiomyopathy from severe cobalt poisoning in the setting of arthroprosthetic cobaltism with symptomatic improvement upon revision of the hip.
