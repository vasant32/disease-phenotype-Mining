Diabetes mellitus is one of the main risk factors of cerebrovascular disease (CVD). Comparing non-diabetic and diabetic patients, the latter ones have a higher incidence of stroke, which tends to occur at younger ages. This paper deals with Echo Doppler evaluation of arteries in diabetic and non-diabetic patients. The findings allow us to conclude that the correct and early treatment of diabetes as well as a possible lowering of the risks for cerebrovascular disease are obligatory steps in the primary and secondary prevention of the cerebral ischemic events in diabetic patients with carotid atheromatous lesions. This consideration may help the physicians to have a deeper understanding of the pathophysiology, and to implement the necessary treatment and prevention of CVD in the diabetic population of high-risk.
