BACKGROUND: The monocyte receptor for bacterial lipopolysaccharide CD14 is an important mediator of the inflammatory response. Recently, a polymorphism in the promotor of the CD14 gene, C (-260) T, was detected as a risk factor for coronary heart disease. OBJECTIVE: We tested the hypotheses that this polymorphism is a risk factor 1. for cerebral ischemia in general and 2. for cerebral ischemia due to large artery atherosclerosis or microangiopathy in particular. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a case control study including 151 consecutive patients with acute cerebral ischemia treated at our university hospital and 149 control subjects. All control subjects were randomly selected from the general population of the same region in South-West Germany. Genotype frequencies of the C(-260) T polymorphism in the promotor of the CD14 gene were examined by restriction length analysis. RESULTS: The TT-genotype was not associated with cerebral ischemia in general either in univariate or in multivariate analysis together with classical vascular risk factors (odds ratio in multivariate analysis: 1.11; 95 %CI, 0.63 to 1.95). In 70 patients with cerebral ischemia due to atherosclerosis of large arteries or microangiopathy, there was a significantly higher prevalence of the TT-genotype than into control subjects (38.6 % vs. 23.5 %; odds ratio in multivariate analysis 2.26; 95 %CI, 1.13 to 4.54). CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that the TT-genotype of the CD14 C(-260) T polymorphism in a South-German population is not associated with an increased risk of cerebral ischemia in general. However, we found that the TT-genotype is associated with a risk of atherosclerotic or microangiopathic stroke. This finding requires confirmation by future studies in larger populations.
