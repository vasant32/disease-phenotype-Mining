Intracranial atherosclerotic disease (ICAD) is being seen as an increasingly important cause of transient ischemic attack and stroke. Attention on this disease entity has been focused as a result of two recent events: the publication of the WASID trial and the recent Food and Drug Administration approval of the Wingspan-Gateway stent system. This manuscript will review the evolution of the role of endovascular therapy in the management of ICAD. In addition, the available devices currently available for endovascular therapy will be reviewed with an eye toward peri-procedural and follow-up complication rates.
