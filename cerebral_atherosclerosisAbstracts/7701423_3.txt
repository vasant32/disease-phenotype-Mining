We report a case of chronic Sjogren's cerebritis complicated by bilateral superior cerebellar artery occlusion and diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage. Although primary Sjogren's syndrome with chronic leptomeningeal involvement has been well documented and a spectrum of central nervous system disease previously outlined, no case of intracranial subarachnoid hemorrhage with major intracranial vessel occlusion has been reported.
