The authors describe clinical manifestations of pseudoneurotic states and vegetative paroxysms in 78 patients with transient disturbances of brain circulation which appeared due to hypertensive disease and atherosclerosis. The special studies (EEG, REG, determination of catecholamine excretion) showed that pseudoneurotic states and paroxysmal vegetative disturbances depend on the state of brain circulation and functional activity of the sympathetico-adrenal system. The authors attempt to differentiate pseudoneurotic and paroxysmal vegetative disorders in transient disturbances of brain circulation from neuroses and initial dysfunction of the vegetative structures.
