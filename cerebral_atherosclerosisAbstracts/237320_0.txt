In"cerebral arteriosclerosis" the diffuse sclerotic involvement of the cerebral vessels may produce acute softening of cerebral tissue. However this paper concentrates mainly on the clinical symptomatology which, in the absence of major vascular accidents, is characterized from the psychopathologic viewpoint by acute confusional states, aggressive behaviour, fluctuating loss of memory, disturbances of concentration and finally dementia. The chief neurologic symptoms are motor disturbance with short-stepping gait, stooped position of the body, pseudobulbar symptoms with dysarthric speech and disturbances of swallowing, and increased perioral reflexes. A complete case history and a thorough neurologic and psychopathologic examination are the most important factors in diagnosis, while ancillary methods are of value only for differential diagnosis. Prophylaxis and therapy (cardiotherapy, treatment of diabetes and hypertension, lowering of serum cholesterol and sedation) are discussed. In the differential diagnosis of dementia in the elderly patient consideration should be given to chronic vascular diseases, degenerative cerebral atrophies, brain tumors, low pressure hydrocephalus, progressive paralysis and some other rare brain conditions.
