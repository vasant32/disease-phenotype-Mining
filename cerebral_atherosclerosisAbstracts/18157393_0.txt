BACKGROUND: The apo B/apo A-I ratio represents the balance between atherogenic particles, rich in apo B, and the antiatherogenic ones, apo A-I rich. This study investigated the association between atherosclerotic diseases in different anatomical sites and apo B/apo A-I ratio. METHODS: Lipids, lipoproteins, and apolipoproteins A-I and B were assessed in 30 subjects with coronary artery disease (CAD), 26 with ischemic stroke (IS), 30 with peripheral arterial obstructive disease (PAOD), and 38 healthy subjects (controls). RESULTS: HDLc and Apo A-I were significantly lower in PAOD and CAD groups, respectively, than in other groups. Significantly higher levels of triglycerides were observed for CAD and PAOD groups than for controls. Apo B was significantly higher in IS group than in control and PAOD groups. The apo B/apo A-I ratio showed significantly higher in CAD and IS groups when compared to control and PAOD groups (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The apo B/apo A-I ratio was important for identifying an increased trend for coronary and cerebral atherosclerosis. In spite of the increased trend for apo B/apo A-I ratio in IS and CAD groups, the studied variables cannot be considered in an isolated way, given as those parameters were analyzed together by a binary logistic regression, no association has been demonstrated.
