Patients with chronic arterial disorders (CAD) frequently exhibit rheological alterations of the blood beneath generalisated sclerosing of the vessels and restricted arterial diameters. Alterations of different rheological parameters were determined in more than 80% of the examined patients. The following parameters were measured: yield shear stress in the ESM, hematocrit level in the IHA, plasma viscosity in the CTPV, standardized erythrocyte aggregation index in the MEA and standardized erythrocyte rigidity index in the SER.
