The authors present data on examining platelet and erythrocyte aggregation, blood viscosity, and platelet adhesion index in 96 patients with initial signs of cerebral circulation insufficiency, 45 patients with transient disturbances of the cerebral circulation, and in 40 patients with cerebral infarctions due to atherosclerosis and its combination with arterial hypertension. On the basis of the data obtained the importance of the changes of the blood rheological properties in the pathogenesis of the atherosclerotic cerebrovascular disorders (of various gravity) was specified, a dependence of these changes on the acuity of the manifestations of the transient cerebral circulation disturbances or cerebral infarction, and on the use of medicines was disclosed, and recommendations on administering antiaggregants and drugs lowering the blood viscosity and erythrocyte aggregation are given.
