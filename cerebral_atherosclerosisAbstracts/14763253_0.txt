The aim of the study was to investigate the concentration changes of free (f) thyroxine (fT4), triiodothyronine (fT3), thyrotrophic hormone (TTH), adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH), aldosterone and renin in the blood plasma of patients with vascular encephalopathy (VE) and to evaluate their influence on formation of chronic blood circulation deficiency. Thirty-nine patients with VE of stages I and II, aged 45-73 years, without current acute or chronic (in exacerbation stage) other somatic diseases have been studied. The results revealed that a different extent of diffuse lesion of brain tissue was accompanied by an own pattern of thyroid homeostasis: 1) significantly higher TTH levels with intact regulatory negative feedback "fT3-TTH" in patients with VE, stage 1; 2) significant TTH concentration decrease, with pronounced suppression of thyroxine conversion to triiodothyronine and interaction disturbance in the "fT3--pituitary gland" system, in patients with VE in stage II. A distinct trend towards plasma cortisol level increase as well as significantly lower active plasma renin levels were found in the patients with VE in stage II comparing to those in stage I. Correlation analysis demonstrated the absence of an interaction between patient's age and hormonal homeostasis state and an extent of vascular stenosis. The data suggest involvement of the hormones of hypothalamopituitary-adrenal, thyroid and renin-angiotensin systems in VE formation thus enabling using of the results of their testing as an additional criterion for estimation of brain diffusive lesion severity.
