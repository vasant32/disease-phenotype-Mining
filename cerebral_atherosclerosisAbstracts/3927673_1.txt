Duplex sonography and intravenous digital subtraction angiography (DSA) were compared in 102 carotid bifurcations in 51 patients. Sonograms were adequate in 87 (85%) vessels and angiograms were adequate on at least one view in 86 (84%) vessels. An adequate image was obtained by one or the other method in all but two vessels (98%). Although most vessels were seen well on one view only on DSA, agreement with sonography was exact in 73% of compared vessels and acceptable in 96%. Furthermore, no difference was found in the rate of agreement with sonography for vessels seen well by DSA on two or more views compared with those seen well on one view only. It was concluded that DSA and sonography are comparable screening methods for carotid disease and that a suboptimal study by either can usually be compensated for by performance of the other.
