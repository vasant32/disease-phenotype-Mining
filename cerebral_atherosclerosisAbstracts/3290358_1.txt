Fifteen patients with amaurosis fugax (AF), 37 with hemispheric TIA and 35 with reversible ischemic neurological deficit (RIND) were examined in the extracranial carotid arteries by duplex ultrasound within two months from symptoms. The most advanced atherosclerotic lesions were found among AF followed by hemispheric TIA. These two groups differed significantly from RIND which showed less advanced lesions, both on the symptomatic and asymptomatic side. Among RIND patients lesions showing 50% stenosis or more were seldom seen. Similar differences between the three groups were found after angiography of a subgroup. The hemispheric TIA group showed cholesterol, triglycerides and creatinine compared to AF and RIND. Previous atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases were more often found among AF and hemispheric TIA than among RIND. It is suggested that TIAs, including AF, and RIND should be regarded as separate entities from a pathophysiological and clinical point of view.
