BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The clinical patterns of stroke and the angiographic distribution of cerebral atherosclerosis in Chinese people are different from those in whites. Studies relating carotid atherosclerosis and vascular risk factors to various types of stroke in Chinese people are lacking. METHODS: Based on clinical information, we separated 367 stroke patients living in Taiwan into four subgroups: cortical infarction (CI), subcortical infarction (SCI), vertebrobasilar artery infarction (VBAI), and cardioembolic infarction (CEI). We assessed the extent and severity of extracranial carotid artery atherosclerosis in different types of ischemic stroke using duplex ultrasonography. Vascular risk factors and carotid atherosclerosis were then correlated with each subgroup of ischemic stroke. RESULTS: Our data revealed that 32% of the CI subgroup, 3% of the SCI subgroup, 7% of the VBAI subgroup, and 21% of the CEI subgroup possessed severe carotid stenosis (> or = 50% stenosis or occlusion). The extent of atherosclerosis of extracranial carotid arteries, measured by plaque score, was also more severe in the CI subgroup than in the other subgroups. Diabetes mellitus was more frequent in the CI subgroup. Cardiomegaly and left ventricular hypertrophy were more commonly seen in the CEI subgroup. The VBAI subgroup was younger than the other subgroups. There were no differences in hypertension, prior stroke, alcohol intake, or serum levels of glucose, uric acid, hematocrit, lipids, and lipoproteins among the subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: Of the Chinese patients living in Taiwan, the extent and severity of extracranial carotid artery atherosclerosis were more prominent in patients with CI than in patients with other types of ischemic stroke. In Chinese patients with CI, severe carotid stenosis is not uncommon; in Chinese patients with SCI, however, the frequency of carotid stenosis is quite low.
