Fifty patients with the clinical diagnosis of initial manifestations of the deficiency of the brain blood supply and 30 normal persons of the corresponding age (the control group) were studied. The main group consisted of patients from 40-67 years. Along with the similar clinical study rheoencephalographic and electroencephalographic studies with the aid of various functional samples were conducted. The initial manifestations of the inadequacy in the brain blood supply frequently developed on the background of cerebral atherosclerosis of a different type of expressiveness, hypertensive disease and their combination, vegetovascular dystonia. With the help of the functional samples the peculiarities of reactivity of the vascular system were established in these patients. The antiorthostatic and nitroglycerin samples appeared to be informative. The combined REG and EEG registrations demonstrated in these patients signs of a deficit of brain blood supply causing in a number of cases changes in its functional states. The clinical (seldom electrographic) changes are of a reversible character and regress during the treatment of the main vascular disease. The obtained data permit to recommend the method of functional electrography (REG and EEG) in order to reveal the initial forms of brain vascular diseases. These patients must be supervised by a dispansary.
