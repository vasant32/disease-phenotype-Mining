Twenty-nine patients developed recurrent stenosis of the carotid artery 5 months to 13 years following carotid endarterectomy. Thirty-two recurrent lesions were repaired. Recurrent atherosclerosis was present in 19 patients, intimal fibrosis occcurred in nine patients, and one patient had external stricture. All recurrent atheromas developed more than 2 years following original operation (mean, 5 years) and intinal fibrosis was seen in the first postoperative year in all but one patient (mean, 9 months). Reconstructive techniques included endarterectomy for atherosclerosis and patch angioplasty and resection and anastomosis for intimal fibrosis.
