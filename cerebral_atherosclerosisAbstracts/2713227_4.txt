Carotid atherosclerosis occurring secondary to cervical irradiation is known to produce stroke. Transient neurologic symptoms have necessitated surgical intervention to prevent stroke despite concern over technical problems, wound healing, operative risks, and uncertain therapeutic outcome. With this report, 26 surgical procedures in 20 patients are now documented in the literature (12 men--60%; eight women--40%). Mean age of these patients (56 years) was 10 years younger than carotid surgery patients with no prior radiation history. No relationship was noted between elevated serum cholesterol and the subsequent development of radiation-induced carotid atherosclerosis. Surgical procedures performed included carotid endarterectomy in 17 cases (65%) and arterial bypass in nine (35%). The combination of radiation therapy and previous neck surgery, including prior radical neck dissection, did not adversely influence operability. Surgical outcome was uniformly good with only one stroke (4%) documented in the perioperative period. Longer follow-up on our six cases (mean two years) disclosed neither new clinical symptoms nor the development of hemodynamically significant restenosis.
