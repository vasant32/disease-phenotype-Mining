The authors have studied clinical manifestations in 47 patients with cerebral stroke in whom neurological symptomatology completely regressed within 1-21 days. The underlying disease in all patients was atherosclerosis. Impairment of the blood circulation most often involved the carotid bed. Comparison of the findings provided by angiography and computerized tomography conducted in patients with minor stroke, patients with transient impairments of the cerebral circulation, and those with stroke characterized by stable neurological deficiency revealed definite differences between the groups. Certain questions related to the pathogenesis of minor stroke in patients with atherosclerosis are discussed.
