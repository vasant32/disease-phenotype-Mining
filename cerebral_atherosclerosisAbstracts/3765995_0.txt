Albino rats fed an atherogenic diet for 3 months developed a marked depression of the anti-coagulation system of blood. The acoustic and sensomotor cortex showed dystrophic changes in the cortical structures, as well as signs of the reparative nature. Sound stimulation in the presence of atherosclerosis increased fibrinolytic activity and decreased heparin tolerance of blood plasma in animals sensitive to acoustic exposure and led to a greater severity and dissemination of dystrophic and destructive changes in the cortical structures, particularly in animals with convulsive seizures.
