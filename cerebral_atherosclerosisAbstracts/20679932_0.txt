 BACKGROUND: Treatment of intracranial atherosclerotic disease with the Wingspan-Gateway intracranial stent and balloon angioplasty system has been reported in several multicenter registries. To date, the incidence of acute intraprocedural thrombus formation during Wingspan stent placement has not been reported. OBJECTIVE: We reviewed the incidence of acute thrombus formation, treatment, and outcome for patients who underwent Wingspan stent placement by the senior author (B.L.H.) between June 2006 and April 2009. METHODS: We routinely perform angiograms every 10 minutes for at least 30 minutes after placement of a Wingspan stent to check for acute thrombus formation. Acute thrombus was graded: (1) visible thrombus but not flow limiting, (2) visible and flow-limiting thrombosis, and (3) complete stent occlusion. Recanalization was graded according to Thrombosis In Myocardial Infarction score. RESULTS: Forty-one patients underwent Wingspan stent placement for intracranial stenosis. Acute intraprocedural thrombus formation developed in 6 (14.6%) within 20 minutes after stent placement: 3 grade 1, 1 grade 2, and 2 grade 3. All 6 were successfully recanalized with Thrombosis In Myocardial Infarction score 3 after intravenous abciximab with or without intra-arterial tissue plasminogen activator and/or balloon angioplasty. There was no morbidity, and all 6 patients were discharged home at their neurological baseline. CONCLUSION: We recommend serial angiography every 10 minutes for at least 30 minutes after placement of Wingspan stents. Once detected, acute thrombosis can be successfully treated with intravenous abciximab with or without intra-arterial tissue plasminogen activator and/or balloon angioplasty.
