 INTRODUCTION: There has been limited attention to pathological features of basilar artery atherosclerosis. It has been assumed that pathology of basilar artery atherosclerosis mimics that of other vascular beds. METHODS: To define the nature of the basilar artery atherosclerotic lesions, we analyzed postmortem intracranial artery samples from eight subjects with history of stroke. RESULTS: Atherosclerotic lesions were present in 7/8 arteries examined, with a mean estimated stenosis of 34%. Lumen thrombus with a disrupted fibrous cap was seen in 1 lesion; the remaining 6 lesions revealed a thick fibrous cap. Neovascularity and calcification were seen in 1 lesion and mild to moderate inflammation was seen in 3 lesions. Necrotic core was present in 4/7 lesions, and was associated with plaque rupture in the only disrupted lesion. CONCLUSIONS: Basilar artery atherosclerotic lesions were relatively benign in this series of patients presenting with stroke. While confirmation is needed with larger sample size, the relative paucity of neovascularity suggests a possibly distinctive histopathological profile.
