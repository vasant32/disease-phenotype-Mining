Results of using vasopressin and pituitrin in 20 patients with memory disturbances of various genesis (due to circulatory disturbances in the vertebrobasilar system, cerebral atherosclerosis, neurasthenia, brain concussion, epilepsy) are reviewed. The therapeutic efficacy of the hormones was evaluated with the use of a complex of psychophysiological methods. Objective changes in the patients' neurological status and subjective state were taken into account. A high therapeutic efficacy of the hormones in the treatment of amnestic syndromes is demonstrated.
