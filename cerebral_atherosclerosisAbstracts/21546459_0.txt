 BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Intracranial angioplasty and stent placement are used to treat intracranial atherosclerotic disease. The 2 interventions have not been directly compared. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a single-center, single-operator registry of consecutive, symptomatic subjects receiving treatment (angioplasty, BMS, or WS, chosen based on safety as judged by the operator). After November 2005, angioplasty alone was abandoned following the introduction of the WS. The primary end point was stroke rate per intervention at 30 days. The secondary end point was stroke rate per patient beyond 30 days. Success, dissection, restenosis, and occlusion rates were tracked. RESULTS: From April 2002 to January 2009, 140 subjects with 159 lesions (50%-100% stenosis) underwent 209 interventions: 89 angioplasty, 47 BMS, and 73 WS cases. Overall stroke rate at 30 days was 12.9%. The angioplasty arm had the lowest stroke rate (4.5%), whereas the WS arm had the highest (24.7%; P = .0002), leaving the BMS with 10.7%. Stroke rate beyond 30 days was 9%. The success rate was 58.4% for angioplasty, 81.3% for BMS, and 94.4% for WS, whereas the restenosis rates were 28.2%, 5.8%, and 13.3%, respectively. Dissection increased the risk of stroke in the first 30 days (P = .0439) and restenosis (P = .0051). Perforator vessels were more likely than nonperforators to have stroke within 30 days (P = .008). Eccentric lesions were more likely to have stroke than concentric lesions (P = .0726). CONCLUSIONS: In this comparison, angioplasty had a significantly lower stroke rate than WS. Certain lesion locations, morphologic characteristics, and the presence of dissection after treatment were other predictors of unfavorable outcome.
