BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The feasibility of implementing an expert consensus guideline recommending use of a stroke patient's profile to manage undiagnosed coronary artery disease remains unclear. METHODS: Following a guideline-based algorithm, we screened consecutive patients with ischemic stroke and patients with transient ischemic attack for asymptomatic coronary artery disease using the Framingham Heart Study Coronary Risk Score (FCRS) cutoff of high risk (> or = 20%) for experiencing a hard coronary artery disease event over a 10-year period. Patients with high FCRS received dobutamine stress echocardiogram outpatient screening, additional treatment (beta-blocker), or further management (cardiologist referral). RESULTS: From July 2004 to September 2007, among 693 patients, 501 (72%) met study criteria, of which 80 (16%) had FCRS > or = 20%. Elevated serum glucose, nonhigh-density lipoprotein, triglycerides, homocysteine, glycosylated hemoglobin as well as large vessel atherosclerotic stroke mechanism were more frequent in high versus low FCRS patients (P<0.05). Among high FCRS patients, 35 (44%) had dobutamine stress echocardiogram performed. Leading reasons for dobutamine stress echocardiogram nonperformance were patient noncompliance (42%) and primary care physician refusal (33%). CONCLUSIONS: Screening for coronary artery disease risk using FCRS is feasible in hospitalized patients with stroke, but outpatient adherence to stress testing is challenging largely due to patient and primary care physician-related factors.
