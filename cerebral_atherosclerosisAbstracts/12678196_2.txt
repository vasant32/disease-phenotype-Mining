Recognition of coincidence of cerebral vascular disease is of importance in patients with coronary artery disease. One hundred and seventy-three patients who underwent coronary angiography were also studied by angiography of subclavian arteries and abdominal aorta. The majority of the patients (128/173; 74%) were men. Risk factors of hypertension, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia were present in a high percentage of patients. Disease of the proximal part of the vertebral artery was seen in 41.6% (72/173). Presence of vertebral artery disease was significantly correlated with diabetes (p = 0.02), renal artery stenosis (p = 0.003), coronary artery disease (p = 0.05), and iliac artery disease (p = 0.05). The proximal part of the vertebral artery was found to be affected in a high percentage (41.6%) of patients undergoing coronary angiography.
