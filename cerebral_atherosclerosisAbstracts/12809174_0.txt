The aim of this study was to investigate the direct involvement of hyperinsulinaemia, DHEA and DHEA-S [DHEA(S)] in severe obesity in early carotid atherosclerosis, measured as intima-media thickness (IMT). Seventeen normotensive premenopausal women with very high BMI (43.5 +/- 1.6 kg/m2) were recruited for the study. Six women were also evaluated 12 months after laparoscopic adjustable silicone gastric banding (LASGB). Dietary intake, fasting plasma lipid profile, glycemic and insulinemic response to the OGTT, adrenal secretion, at baseline and after ACTH stimulation test, were measured. IMT, common carotid diameter (CD) and left ventricular mass index (LVMi) were measured by B-mode echotomography. All obese subjects showed higher fasting and stimulated insulin levels, but lower DHEA(S) levels than controls, showing a negative correlation between both fasting and stimulated insulin and DHEA(S), either at baseline or after ACTH testing. IMT was higher (p < 0.05) than controls, with a positive correlation with stimulated insulin (p < 0.05) and a strong negative correlation with DHEA(S) (p < 0.001). In a multiple linear regression analysis, insulin response to OGTT maintained an association with DHEA(S) independent of fasting insulin, while DHEA maintained the association with IMT independent of stimulated insulin (p < 0.0001). In the six patients evaluated 12 months after LASGB, fasting insulin levels decreased, while DHEA(S) levels increased (p < 0.05). In conclusion, an early cardiovascular involvement was detected in this group of severe obese with hyperinsulinaemia and low DHEA(S), even in the absence of other well known CVD risk factors.
