A total of 42 patients with atherosclerotic--and 34 with involutional depression were studied by conjunctival biomicroscopy for particular features of lipid peroxidation and state of microcirculation before and after treatment with vasoactive preparations, antioxidants and calcium antagonists. POL were found to be increased in patients with atherosclerotic depression irrespective of the syndrome, and in involutional depression with anxious symptomatology, as well as in those patients in stuporous state, this being accounted by a decreased provision of the organism with antioxidants as well as by an inadequate activity of antioxidant enzymes; high incidence rate of intravascular and vascular changes was also noted in the above patient populations. Tocoferolum acetatum and corinfar potentiated antiaggregational and spasmolytic actions of vasoactive preparations, which fact made for an earlier eradication of microcirculatory disturbances, decrease in the free radical oxidation activity and recovery of those patients getting out of the psychotic state.
