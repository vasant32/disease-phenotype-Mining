OBJECTIVE: To analyze the role of resistin in insulin resistance (IR) through investigating the variation of plasma resistin levels and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in resistin gene 5' flanking region in stroke patients. METHODS: In 103 atherothrombotic cerebral infarction (ACI) patients, 85 lacunar infarction (LI) patients, 70 intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) patients, and 86 healthy controls, plasma resistin and insulin levels were measured by ELISA, SNPs in resistin gene 5' flanking region were detected by PCR and direct DNA sequencing. The subjects' body height and weight, the body mass index, quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI), blood pressure, and the concentration of fasting plasma glucose, triglyceride, total cholesterol, creatinine, low-density lipoprotein, and high-density lipoprotein were also determined. RESULTS: QUICKI was significantly lower in the ACI and ICH patients (0.316 +/- 0.037 and 0.309 +/- 0.032, respectively) than that in the controls (0.342 +/- 0.043, P < 0.001), while plasma resistin level was significantly higher in the ACI and ICH patients (6.36 +/- 3.79 and 7.15 +/- 4.27 ng/mL, respectively) than that in the controls (5.28 +/- 2.56 ng/mL, P < 0.05), but such difference was not observed in the LI patients compared with controls. There was a statistically negative correlation between plasma resistin level with QUICKI (r = -0.228, P < 0.001). The distributions of allele and genotype frequencies of resistin gene - 420C > G and - 537A > C SNPs were not significantly different among the different groups, and those SNPs were not correlated with other clinical and biochemical parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Plasma resistin is associated with stroke by participating in the development of IR. The SNPs in resistin gene 5' flanking region has no impact on the plasma resistin level.
