A group of 20 patients (average age 55.5 yrs) with advanced arterioscleorosis obliterans and cerebral thrombosis were treated with pyridinolcarbamate. Anginin was given for 6 months, 1,5--2 g. per day. Observation period before, during and after the treatment lasted 2 yrs. Medical and psychological examinations were performed; laboratory test included: sphigmooscylography, photoplethysmography, EKG, EEG, cholesterol, triglyceridis and other routine biochemical blood tests. All data are statistically evaluated. Results. During Anginin treatment clinical improvement was noted in 8 cases, in 9 there was no change in neurological examination; 3 cases--deteriorated. Control examination 6 to 12 months after discontinuation of the treatment revealed no changes in 13 patients; 1 patient deteriorated and 6--died. There was improvement in blood circulation as shown by plethysmography and sphigmooscylography in patients with less advanced vascular changes and no change in cases with more advanced disease. In 75% of the patients there was statistically significant (p less than 0.001) decrease of cholesterol and in 50% of triglicerids (not statistically significant). In patients with advanced disease there was no clinical and EEG improvement, on the contrary 1/3 of them deteriorated clinically and in EEG. In cases with less advanced disease clinical improvement was recorded. Anginin seems to be a good drug for patients with moderately advanced combined peripheral and central arteriosclerosis.
