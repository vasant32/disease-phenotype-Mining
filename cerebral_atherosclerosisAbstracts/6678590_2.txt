The carotid lesions of cynomolgus and rhesus monkeys fed an 8- to 12-months atherogenic diet are very severe. However, the basilar, vertebral and middle cerebral arteries of the same atherosclerotic monkeys look instead, at SEM examination, similar to the control ones. At TEM examination, these arteries of the atherosclerotic monkeys show only minimal lesions in the subendothelial space ('edema' and presence of fragments of basilar membrane) and sometimes necrobiosis of endothelial cells. The smooth muscle cells, which are also present in the controls in these arteries in the subendothelial space, are sometimes surrounded by a nest of basement membrane beads and do not contain lipid droplets.
