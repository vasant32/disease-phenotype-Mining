With the aid of a REG method the authors studied the effect of dexametasone on the cerebral hemodynamics in 37 patients with cerebral atherosclerosis with chronic cerebrovascular insufficiency. It was possible to show that there is an accelerated venous blood outflow, a decreased vascular resistance, as well as the absence of a vasopressor reaction to a single intravenous administration of 4 mg of dexametasone. The capability of the preparation to reduce the volume of cerebral pulse waves limits its use in the initial decreased amplitude of cerebral pulse fluctuations.
