Conventional neuropsychological data may not mirror the site of cerebrovascular stenosis in a patient with mild to moderate symptoms. In this study, three groups of cerebral revascularization candidates failed to differ on an extended Halstead-Reitan battery: patients with symptoms and angiographic results referable to the carotid arterial system, subjects with clinical signs and neuroradiological findings referable to the vertebrobasilar arterial system, and patients with symptoms of cerebral ischemia but negative angiograms. Consistent with previous work, these patients generally were mildly impaired on neuropsychological tests, even though many were not symptomatic at the time of assessment. Neuropsychological tests seem to be sensitive to the presence and severity of cerebral ischemia, but in isolation may not be sufficient to determine the loci of vascular stenoses. The incongruence between angiographic and neuropsychological findings underlines the importance of distinguishing among different levels and types of measurements in defining subgroups of cerebral revascularization candidates. Collaboration among neuroscientists will further our understanding of the interrelationships among neurodiagnostic tests.
