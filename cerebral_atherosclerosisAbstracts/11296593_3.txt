Regression of symptomatic intracranial atherostenosis is not known to be a common occurrence. In this case, delay of basilar reconstruction by endovascular means permitted serial angiographic assessment of plaque change. The use of high-dose atorvastatin over a 2-week period was associated with marked angiographic improvement. Medical programs of plaque stabilization may provide adjunctive benefit in patients with symptomatic intracranial disease.
