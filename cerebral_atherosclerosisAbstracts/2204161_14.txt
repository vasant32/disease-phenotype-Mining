Ulcerations and intraplaque hemorrhages are thought to play an important role in the development of neurological deficits in carotid artery stenoses. To assess the ability of duplex scanning to predict plaque morphology we compared different sonographic criteria (plaque border, plaque density, plaque structure) with the morphological findings in 169 consecutive carotid endarterectomies (144 cases with diameter reduction greater than 50%). Two percent of the sonograms were inadequate, and 20% showed poor image quality. Regular plaque borders revealed a smooth or at most minimally ulcerated surface in 92%. Grossly ulcerated stenoses, however, were only found in 27% of the irregular plaques. Moreover, the plaque border was nonvisible in 35% of all cases. Simple, fibro-atheromatous plaques were found to be echogenic in 72% and echolucency was present in 80% of the stenoses with relevant intraplaque hemorrhage. In conclusion, duplex scanning proved to be capable of detecting smooth, fibro-atheromatous stenoses with high accuracy. Ulcerations, however, cannot be predicted reliably, and intraplaque hemorrhage cannot be differentiated from atheromatous debris.
