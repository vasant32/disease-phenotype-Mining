We used three-dimensional proton NMR images to study ischemic infarction in the territory of the vertebral-basilar posterior cerebral circulation. The study includes sixteen cases, eight of which are presented in detail. In seven cases, the infarctions were secondary to demonstrable large artery occlusive disease -- vertebral, basilar, or posterior cerebral. In nine cases, the infarctions were secondary to what was presumably small vessel disease. In fifteen of the sixteen cases, NMR imaging could locate the infarct, inversion recovery and spin-echo pulse sequences being more sensitive than the saturation recovery pulse sequence. This efficiency rests on the high sensitivity of ischemic infarction to changes in T1 and T2 relaxation time, highlighted in the inversion recovery and spin-echo images, respectively. The additional advantages of the three-dimensional approach, and the lack of bone artifact, make NMR imaging superior to CT scanning in identifying areas of infarction in the territory of posterior cerebral circulation.
