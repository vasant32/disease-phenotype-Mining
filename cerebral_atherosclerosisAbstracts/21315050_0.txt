 AIM: To study the expressional changes of soluble CD40 ligand(sCD40L) in peripheral blood serum and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) p65 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of patients with acute progressive cerebral infarction(APCI). METHODS: We selected ninety-nine patients getting APCI less than 7 d of the onset as APCI group by prospective method. Each 100 cases of patients with acute cerebral infarction(ACI) in the same and with cerebral arteriosclerosis(CAS) in the outpatient were respectively selected as ACI and CAS group. The expressional changes of sCD40L in peripheral blood serum and NF-κBp65 in PBMC of patients with CAS on admission, of patients with APCI and ACI when in hospital, on the course of seventh day, of fourteen and of thirtieth were detected respectively. RESULTS: The expression of sCD40L in peripheral blood serum and NF-κBp65 in PBMC of patients of ACI group on admission were obviously higher all than that of CAS group (P<0.05); The expression of sCD40L in peripheral blood serum and NF-κBp65 in PBMC of patients of APCI group when in hospital, on the course of seventh day, of fourteen and of thirtieth were obviously higher all than that of ACI group (P<0.05 ). CONCLUSION: The inflammatory and apoptotic mechanism mediated by expressional excessive increase of CD40-CD40L signal passage and NF-κB in PBMC might be one of the molecular biology mechanisms of onset and progress for APCI.
