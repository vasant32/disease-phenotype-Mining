The patients with chronic heart disease (265 subjects) and with little active rheumatic fever (145 subjects) received two variants of isocaloric diets which differed only in protein quota. The former diet contained the physiological norm of protein (100 g) and the latter one a higher quota (130 g). As a result of the treatment the subjective sensations and objective status of all the patients improved. Evaluation of the time course of lipid metabolism, the system of hemostasis, capillary permeability and immunological reactivity showed that the diet containing the physiological norm of protein appeared the most effective in patients with ischemic heart disease, whereas that with a higher protein quota turned out the most adequate in patients with rheumatic fever.
