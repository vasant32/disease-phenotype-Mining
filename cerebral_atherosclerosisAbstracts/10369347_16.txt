A 72-year-old man underwent cerebral angioplasty and stenting for a high-grade eccentric atherosclerotic stenosis (93%) of the right intracranial vertebral artery. The lesion was sufficiently and smoothly dilated very easily with the use of a highly flexible, balloon-expandable coronary stent. No complications occurred during or after the procedure. This therapeutic option may prove to be a safe and useful means to resolve an intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis.
