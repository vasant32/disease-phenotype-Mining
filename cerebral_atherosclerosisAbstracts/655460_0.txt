A thorough search for the natural history of arteriosclerosis involving the cerebrum, aorta, and peripheral vessels has been made. The disease's rate of progress has been studied anatomically, clinically, radiologically, and plethysmographically. We conclude that arteriosclerosis is usually associated with other diseases such as diabetes, high blood cholesterol, and hypertension. Heart disease in particular is often the cause of the patient's death, rather than the peripheral arteriosclerotic disease itself. The usually slow development and course of arteriosclerosis indicate that its treatment is largely a medical problem. It seems important to control the various risk factors and to utilize surgical therapy to attack specific lesions which threaten the tissues. A thorough cardiovascular profile of the patient should be compiled and should include a glucose tolerance test and lipoprotein phenotyping.
