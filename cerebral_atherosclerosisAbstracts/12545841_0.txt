This study was intended to elucidate the relationship between arteriolar pathological changes and encephalorrhagia in the cases of primary hypertension. Gross anatomy and histology of brain were observed in autopsy of 45 cases of primary hypertension. Forty cases of arteriolar hyalinization including 26 cases of brain hemorrhage were found in those 45 cases of primary hypertension. The hyalinized arterioles were divided to two types. One is characterized by the narrow lumen of terminal arterioles, the other by the dilatant lumen of proximal arterioles. Hemorrhage always occurred in the latter type. Besides these changes, 3 cases of acute necrosis and 5 cases of atherosclerosis in arterioles were related to hemorrhage. These data suggest that brain hemorrhage of primary hypertension mainly occur in dilated and hyalinized arterioles, and some cases are probably related to acute necrosis or atheroscleromatous atrerioles.
