An electron microscopic study of the intracerebral arteries from 9 hypertensive cases was performed in order to elucidate the morphogenesis of the plasmatic arterionecrosis which was considered to be the direct cause of hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage. In the preceding stage of the arterial lesions, marked necrosis of medial smooth muscle cells and increase of basement membrane-like substance in the intima and media were observed. The lumina of these arteries were slightly dilated. The dilatation and hemodynamic factors were supposed to cause endothelial injury resulting in blood plasma insudation into the intima through the opened spaces between endothelial cells. The insudated blood plasma dispersed and dissolved the basement membrane-like substance, collagen and elastic fibers in the arterial wall, leading to the development of the plasmatic arterionecrosis.
