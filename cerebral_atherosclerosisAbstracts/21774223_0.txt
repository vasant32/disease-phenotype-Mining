We measured the ankle-brachial index (ABI) and brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) and ABI in 97 ischemic stroke patients and 93 control subjects to investigate the relationship between baPWV, ABI and risk factors of ischemic stroke. The stroke patients were grouped according to the results of MRA and Carotid artery color Doppler ultrasound. The correlation of baPWV and ABI to the arteriosclerosis was discussed. There was a significant difference in the patients with hypertension, diabetes mellitus, baPWV and ABI between ischemic stroke patients and control subjects. baPWV was the most sensitive risk factor for ischemic stroke. ABI and diabetes mellitus were the relatively sensitive risk factors for ischemic stroke. baPWV were found to have a positive correlation with common carotid arteriosclerosis (gamma=0.215, P=0.048), while ABI had a negative correlation with intracranial arteriosclerosis (gamma=-0.237, P<0.05). BaPWV and ABI may closely relate to severity of ischemic stroke. Simple measurements of baPWV and ABI in patients could be a useful tool for evaluating the risk of ischemic stroke.
