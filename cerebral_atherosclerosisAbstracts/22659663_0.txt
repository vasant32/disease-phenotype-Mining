 OBJECTIVE: To investigate the diagnostic value of transcranial Doppler ultrasound in early stage cerebral arteriosclerosis. METHODS: We selected 50 patients with early cerebral arteriosclerosis as the disease group. At the same time we selected another 50 patients as a control group with no significant symptoms in the nervous system. By 2 MHz pulse Doppler probe through double-temporal windows and pillow windows Basilar artery (BA), the bilateral middle cerebral artery (MCA) was detected. In the TCD spectrum, we selected the spectrum of a single-family cardiac cycle, identified the starting point (ts), pulse-incisure point (ti), end point (te), and the peak velocity (tp), measured the time of the spectrum starting point to the peak velocity (Tp) and calculated the time required for the peak velocity in the share of ventricular systolic (Tp/Ti), the time required for the peak velocity in the share of the whole cardiac cycle (Tp/T). Tp, Tp/Ti and Tp/T were respectively named as time to peak velocity (TPV), peak-time index-1 (PTI-1) and peak-time index-2 (PTI-2). All data were analyzed by SPSS13.0. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in blood vessel velocity, PI, RI and S/D of BA and RMCA (P>0.05) between the control group and the disease group. Compared with the control group, TPV of the BA, LMCA and RMCA significantly extended, PTI-1 and PTI-2 of BA, LMCA and RMCA increased significantly in the disease group (P<0.01). In the disease group, there was no significant correlation between peak time index and PI, S/D (P>0.05). CONCLUSION: TPV, PTI-1 and PTI-2 are sensitive indicators of early stage cerebral arteriosclerosis.
