The hemostasis and rheological properties of the blood were studied in 88 patients with minor stroke (MS), 26 with transient disorders of the cerebral circulation (TDCC), and in 34 patients with stroke with minimum residual symptoms (SMRS). It has been established that disturbances of the hemostasis and rheological properties of the blood are one of the pathogenetic factors with respect to MS. In terms of severity and reversibility the latter occupies an intermediate position between TDCC and SMRS.
