In order to detect the presence of determining factors as predictors of progressive carotid atherosclerosis, the incidence of total serum cholesterol and fibrinogen elevation was evaluated in patients affected by coronary artery disease (CAD). 61 subjects with CAD (mean age 62 years) and significative lesions (> 50%) underwent periodic Echo-Doppler (Duplex scanning) of the supra aortic branches. Total serum cholesterol, HDL, LDL and fibrinogen were monitored, as well. A 24 month follow-up period was performed. Indicative of the progression of carotid atherosclerosis has been considered the presence of a stenosis degree over 20% than the initial one. In 14 of the 61 subjects who entered the study, there was evidence of progressive carotid atherosclerosis. The same patients showed higher levels of LDL cholesterol (130 +/- 36.3 vs 96.5 +/- 33.2) and Fibrinogen (398.3 +/- 59.4 vs 328 +/- 36.8) and lower levels of HDL cholesterol (27.2 +/- 4.2 vs 34.4 +/- 10.1). Our results confirm the importance of cholesterol and fibrinogen as determining risk factors, especially in patients with multiple vascular disease (coronary and carotid).
