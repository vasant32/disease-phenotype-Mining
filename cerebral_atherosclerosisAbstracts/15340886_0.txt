INTRODUCTION: Intracranial stenoses (IS) are known to be a manifestation of atherosclerosis and a cause of cerebral ischemia, although very few clinical reports have appeared describing such patients in our milieu. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to describe the vascular risk factors, clinical presentation, radiological characteristics, aetiological role played in strokes and the vessels affected in a series of Spanish patients suffering from stroke and IS. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective descriptive study of patients admitted to the Cerebrovascular Pathology Unit with strokes and IS between 1990 and 2001. Data collected included: age, sex, arterial hypertension (AHT), diabetes (Db), hypercholesterolemia (HC), smoking (Sm), ischemic or emboligenic heart disease, intermittent claudication, carotid atheromatosis, clinical presentation of stroke and earlier lesions in computerised axial tomography (CAT) scans of the brain. RESULTS: 132 patients; 187 stenotic vessels: 65.7% males, mean age 68.3 years. AHT 65%, Db 39%, HC 40%, Sm 43%, ischemic heart disease 22%, emboligenic heart disease 17%, intermittent claudication 13%. Clinical presentation: TIA 16%, LACI 33%; PACI 25%, TACI 4%, POCI 19%. Significant carotid atheromatosis 26.5%. Symptomatic IS 50%: mean age 63.3 years, 64% females. Arteries affected: vertebral (VA) 28%; middle cerebral (MCA) 27%; carotid siphon 21%; basilar (BA) 10% (65% symptomatic); anterior cerebral (ACA) 5% and posterior cerebral (CPA) 4%. Normal cranial CAT scan 24%, lacunar infarcts 42%, territorial 32%; leukoaraiosis 17%. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with stroke and IS display different clinical profiles according to their sex (males: a higher number of vascular risk factors and clinical involvement of other territories; females are more symptomatic, AHT and HC); they usually present clinically as lacunar syndromes, with a scarce amount of significant atheromatous carotid involvement, except IS of the VA, and IS of the BA are the most symptomatic.
