The authors analyzed the results of the rheoencephalographic examination of the cerebral hemodynamics under graded exercise (GE) in 42 normal subjects and 60 patients with cerebral atherosclerosis. All individuals were males aged 40-59 years. It was shown that an increase in the blood content of the brain in the process of GE in the patients with cerebral atherosclerosis was significantly lower than in the normal subjects. With a greater volume of the work done the difference became more pronounced. According to the nature of the response to GE the cerebral hemodynamics in the patients was divided into compensated, subcompensated and decompensated types.
