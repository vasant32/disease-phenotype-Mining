To investigate the impact of metabolic syndrome (MetSD) on the development of intracranial atherosclerotic stroke, the authors evaluated the components of the MetSD in 512 patients with stroke. The MetSD was observed most frequently in patients with intracranial atherosclerosis (p = 0.007). In multiple regression analysis, the MetSD, but not conventional risk factors, was independently associated with intracranial atherosclerosis (p = 0.005). The results suggest that treatment of metabolic abnormalities may be an important prevention strategy for intracranial atherosclerosis.
