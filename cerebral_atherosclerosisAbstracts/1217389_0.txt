The symptomatology of acute pneumonia was expressed in diverse neurological and psychiatric changes, including cerebral circulation. The author conducted clinico-EEG and EMG correlations in disturbed cerebral circulation due to acute pneumonia. An important role in disorders of cerebral circulation is played by hypoxia, intoxication and changed metabolism, conditions leading to changed functional limbico-hypothalamoreticular complexes and changed vascular regulation.
