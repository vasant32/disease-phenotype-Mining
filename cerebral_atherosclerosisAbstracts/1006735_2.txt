Concentrations of various lipids and glycosaminoglycans (GAG) in the intima of the grossly normal and atherosclerotic cerebral arteries were compared with those of the aorta and coronary arteries. The lowest percentage of esterified cholesterol (EC) in total cholesterol, and of chondroitin sulfate-4/6 (CS-4/6) in total glycosaminoglycans and the highest percentage of heparin sulfate (HS) in total GAG are the characteristic features of the normal intima of normal cerebral arteries when compared with those in the aorta and coronary artery. In the cerebral arterial intimas, but not in the aorta or coronary arteries, there was a significant positive correlation between contents of EC and percentage and total content of CS-4/6. Atherogenesis in cerebral arteries is discussed in comparison to that of the aorta and coronary vessels.
