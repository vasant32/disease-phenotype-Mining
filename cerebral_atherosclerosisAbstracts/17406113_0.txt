BACKGROUND: C-reactive protein (CRP) as a non-specific inflammatory biomarker has been demonstrated to actively contribute to all stages of atherogenesis. The aim of this study was to investigate the relation between CRP concentrations and the severity of stenosis of cerebral arteries. METHODS: Lipid parameters and CRP levels were measured in the sera of 119 patients with stenosis of the extracranial cerebral arteries established by angiography and compared with the control group, with a normal appearance of the cerebral arteries on ultrasound examination. CRP concentrations were determined by a high-sensitivity assay. RESULTS: CRP concentrations showed a statistically significant difference in the group of patients with cerebrovascular stenosis of more than 70% compared to the control group (median value 3.4 vs. 1.5 mg/l in the control group, p < 0.05). At logistic regression analysis, CRP was significantly associated with stenosis of more than 70%. CONCLUSION: In addition to traditional biochemical risk markers, an elevated CRP level measured on automated analysers using a high-sensitivity assay may be useful in the detection of patients with severe stenosis of the cerebral arteries.
