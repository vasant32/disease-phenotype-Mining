OBJECTIVE: To investigate the frequency of the restrict fragment length polimorphisms (RFLP) at 2 MspI sites in the 5' - end of apolipoprotein AI (ApoAI) gene and its potential interaction to atherosclerotic cerebral infarction (ACI) in Chinese Han population. METHOD: Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique was used in a sample of 199 cases with documented ACI and 204 healthy matched by age and sex individuals selected from Chinese Han nationality in Beijing. The studied loci include promoter region (-75 bp) and the intron - 1 (+83 bp). RESULTS: (1) Both ACI and control groups M1 + + and M1 + - were major frequent genotypes in Beijng area, M2 + + were major frequent genotypes in intron - 1; (2) M1 + - genotype appeared more common among patients than in controls (0.487 vs 0.368, P < 0.05, OR = 1.64); (3) Individuals with M1 + -/M2 + + haplotype were significantly increased in patients compared with controls (0.437 vs 0.314, P < 0.05, OR = 1.70). CONCLUSION: It is suggested that both M1 + - genotype and M1 + -/M2 + + haplotype of ApoAI gene might associate with ACI in our study.
