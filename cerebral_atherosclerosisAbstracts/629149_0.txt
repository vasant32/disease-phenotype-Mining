The authors studied general and cerebral hemodynamics in 51 patients with cerebral atherosclerosis transient disorders of cerebral circulation. The studies demonstrated correlation between the indices of general peripheral resistance of the blood flow, cardiac and pulse indices. The rate of the blood flow in the segment hand-ear was slower. REG studies detected deficit of blood repletion, intrahemispheric asymmetry, a drop in the elasticity of the vascular wall. These data may be used in prescribing pathogenetical treatment to patients with transient disorders of cerebral circulation.
