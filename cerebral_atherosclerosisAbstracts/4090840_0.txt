Sixty-eight patients with bilateral damage to bifurcations of the carotid arteries, of them 22 with attendant damage to the vertebral arteries, were subjected to operation on one carotid artery. An analysis of the findings of dopplerography, angiography and intraoperative electromanometry revealed the following factors affecting the retrograde pressure (RP) in the internal carotid artery (ICA): the state of the contralateral ICA, the functional state of the anterior connective artery of the brain, intracranial localization of injury and the attendant involvement of the vertebral arteries. There was no correlation between the RP in the ICA and the level of artificial hypertension.
