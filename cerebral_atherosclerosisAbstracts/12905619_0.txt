Extracranial carotid artery occlusive disease is a major cause of ischemic stroke in Caucasians. However, intracranial artery occlusive disease, especially middle cerebral artery (MCA) stenosis is more significant in Asians. The underlying mechanisms of ischemic stroke with intracranial artery occlusive lesions is different from that of extracranial artery it is expected to recognize the pathogenesis and epidemiology of intracranial artery occlusive disease. By digital magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and transcranial doppler (TCD) instead of traumatic subtract angiography methods for screening diagnosis of intracranial artery stenosis that were developed in recent two decades. In current paper, we summarized the results studied with MRA and TCD in Peking Union Medical College Hospital and Chinese University of Hong Kong with literatures reviews in this field. Two aspects are discussed (1) Methods for diagnosis of intracranial artery stenosis; (2) Epidemiology of intracranial artery stenosis.
