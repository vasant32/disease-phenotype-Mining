In patients with atherosclerotic encephalopathy (AE) the major indices of blood rheology, hemostasis and its cells' functional state were under investigation. Different patterns of blood rheology changes were detected with increased counts of pathological red blood cells and hypercoagulability. These disorders correlated with the rate of major neurological signs and syndromes, and with the disease stage as well. A multilevel positive effect of hemosorption was shown in different pathogenic links of AE related to disorders in lipid metabolism, blood rheology, shape and functional activity of erythrocytes, shifts in the homeostatic systems. This suggested the use of hemosorption as a tool in prevention of ischemic stroke.
