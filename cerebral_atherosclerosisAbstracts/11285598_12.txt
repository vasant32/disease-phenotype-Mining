Percutaneous techniques have dramatically changed our approach to coronary and peripheral revascularization. Intracranial atherosclerosis is a highly morbid disease; however, techniques for revascularization are still in evolution. The authors comprise a multidisciplinary team of neurologists, neuroradiologists, and interventional cardiologists who have collaborated in treating fifteen patients with symptomatic intracranial stenosis who have failed medical therapy. The acute success rate (100%) and one-year freedom from death and stroke (93.4%) using balloon angioplasty and provisional stenting are encouraging. A surprising observation in this patient cohort was that 53% of patients had improvement or resolution of a deficit that was chronic and presumed to be permanent and irreversible. This type of chronic but reversible deficit is termed "brain angina". The background, rationale for a multidisciplinary team, techniques, and preliminary results of intracranial angioplasty with provisional stenting are presented.
