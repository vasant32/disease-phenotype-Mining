The author studied changes of the coagulative blood system in patients with atherosclerotic and senile dementia (82 cases). In cases with simple forms of senile dementia a tendency towards hypercoagulability was established (an increased formation of thrombin, the amount of fibrinogen content). However, this group demonstrated a defensive activation of the anticoagulative system, sufficient to maintain an equilibrium in the whole system of hemocoagulation. An exhaustion of compensation may lead to stasis and microthrombosis in the smallest vessels and capillaries, which indicates to the pathogenetical significance of changes in the coagulative blood properties.
