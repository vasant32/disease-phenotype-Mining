In 150 patients with an acute cerebrovascular insufficiency we asked the following questions: 1. How often appear together the cardiac decompensation and disturbances of cardiac rhythm, 2. symptoms of hypertrophy and disturbances of cardiac rhythm and 3. arteriosclerosis of the cerebral and coronary vessels in deceased patients. The number of patients examined showed 26.7% of patients in whom a combination of symptoms of cardiac decompensation and disturbances of cardiac rhythm was present. The combination of signs of hypertrophy in the electrocardiogram and disturbances of cardiac rhythm was registered 39 times (26.0%). The arteriosclerosis was found in 68.2% of the patients in post-mortem examination. There was a high correlation between the sclerosis of the intracranial cerebral brains (65.9%) and the sclerosis of the coronary vessels (75.0%). It is referred to the possibilities of the prevention of the cerebrovascular insufficiency and the early therapy of hypertony, the cardiac decompensation and disturbances of cardiac rhythm.
