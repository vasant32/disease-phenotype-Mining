A critical review is presented of 12 clinical trials with Hydergine (a hydrogenated ergot alkaloid preparation) in the treatment of dementia. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons of improvement in symptoms showed that Hydergine consistently produced statistically significant (p less than or equal to 0.05) improvement in 13 symptoms associated with dementia. However, because of the small magnitude of the improvement and the absence of indications of long-term benefit, Hydergine would seem to be of minor value in dementia therapy. Further research with better methodology and design might lead to a different conclusion.
