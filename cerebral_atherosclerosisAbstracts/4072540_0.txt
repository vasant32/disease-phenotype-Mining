Radionuclide examination of the cerebral blood flow as well as rheoencephalographic, electroencephalographic and experimental-psychological techniques were used to study the nature and interrelationship of changes in the hemodynamics and brain function in middle-aged and elderly people with initial manifestations of cerebral atherosclerosis. It was shown that the cerebral hemodynamics and neurometabolism may be improved by vasoactive means.
