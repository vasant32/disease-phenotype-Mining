Focal cerebral hypoperfusion is a common finding in uncomplicated hypertensives even in the absence of large vessel atherosclerosis, and neuropsychological deficits correlate with cerebral hypoperfusion in hypertensive patients with cerebral microangiopathy. We investigated the effects on cerebral perfusion of the dihydropiridine calcium antagonist lacidipine and of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) in asymptomatic hypertensive patients with concomitant atherosclerosis of the carotid arteries. Fifteen essential hypertensives (including 13 males, aged 55-75 years) with at least one 30-60% stenosis of the internal carotid artery at echo-color Doppler examination were treated in a double-blind, randomized, parallel study with lacidipine (4-6 mg od) or HCTZ (25-50 mg od) for 3 months after a 4-week single-blind placebo period. Regional cerebral perfusion was assessed at baseline and at the end of the treatment period with HMPAO-SPECT. Relative perfusion of cortical and subcortical areas was calculated as the ratio between their tracer activity and that of the cerebellum. At baseline, mean relative perfusion (MRP) of the cortical and subcortical areas was similar in the stenotic and the contralateral side. Despite the fall in pressure, lacidipine increased MRP both in the cortical and in the subcortical areas, whereas HCTZ increased MRP only in the cortical areas. The mean change in local vascular resistance, adjusted for initial perfusion value, was -20 A.U. (arbitrary unit) with lacidipine and -12 A.U. with HCTZ (p < 0.001). These differential effects of antihypertensive drugs on subcortical perfusion may be of benefit in the long-term prevention of vascular dementia in hypertensive patients.
