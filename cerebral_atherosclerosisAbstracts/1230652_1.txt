After extra-intracranial anastomosis one could find a considerable dilatation of the superficial temporal artery in a relatively short period of time. This vessel as well as other arteries of the circulatory system were examined histologically. On the basis of a large amount of autopsy material the atherosclerotic changes of the different vessels were correlated. Thus it turned out that the superficial temporal artery revealed another type of atherosclerotic changes. A type which exhibited hardly any calcification, but shows an increase of elastic fibers which make dilatation of the vessel possible despite of its thickened wall and primarily narrowed lumen.
