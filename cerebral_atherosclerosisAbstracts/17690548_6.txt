BACKGROUND: Little information is available regarding the risk factors for intracranial cerebral atherosclerosis (ICAS), particularly among asymptomatics. METHODS: Data from a consecutive series of 1,208 subjects aged > or =40 years, with no history of stroke, and who had undergone transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (TCD) were collected prospectively. The role of classic risk factors was assessed in the presence and severity of asymptomatic ICAS, which was determined by TCD. RESULTS: Regarding the presence of ICAS, the adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) were as follows: 1.22 (1.08-1.37) for every 10-year increase in age, 1.44 (1.08-1.91) for hypertension and 1.86 (1.33-2.59) for diabetes mellitus. No significant association was observed with regard to male sex, smoking or hyperlipidemia. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that age, hypertension and diabetes mellitus are significant risk factors for ICAS in asymptomatic populations.
