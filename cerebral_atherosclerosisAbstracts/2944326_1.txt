38 stenoses of supra-aortic arteries were dilated with good success in 32 patients over a period of four years. They were 17 stenoses of the internal carotid artery, one of the common carotid artery, 16 of the subclavian artery, and four descending stenoses of the vertebral artery. Indication, method, and results of percutaneous transluminal dilatation of stenoses descending from the vertebral artery are described and discussed, with reference being made to case examples.
