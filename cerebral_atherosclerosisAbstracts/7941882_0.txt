The screening of the random sample from an open population of males aged 40-65 was performed to compare frequency and severity of hemodynamic changes in major head arteries (MHA) due to atherosclerosis in subjects with vascular diseases and clinically normal controls. 866 of the examinees were subjected to MHA ultrasonic dopplerography. Normal circulation appeared only in 13% of the examinees. The rest of them had insufficient circulation or at least one vessel affected with stenosis. The standard index of MHA stenosis amounted to 20.2%. The frequency of MHA stenosis was related to the age, vascular involvement and severity of the latter.
