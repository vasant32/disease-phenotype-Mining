A total of 171 patients of young, middle, and old age presenting initial manifestations of cerebral circulatory insufficiency and early disordered-circulatory encephalopathy were treated with cavinton. The clinical effect of the drug mostly expressed in a considerable decrease of subjective manifestations of the disease was fairly high in most patients of different age groups. The most pronounced positive shifts (according to REG) of the cerebral hemodynamics upon cavinton therapy were observed in young and middle-aged patients. A lower efficacy in elderly patients was explained by the fact that there were grave organic changes in the cerebral vessels, predominantly in those of small and medium caliber. A comprehensive nature of the drug action, as well as the absence of any adverse effect on the cerebral hemodynamics recommend cavinton as a drug of choice in the treatment of patients with chronic forms of cerebral ischemia, including elderly ones. The drug should not be administered to patients over 60 years of age with marked disorders of cardiac activity.
