Sulocton effect was evaluated in 33 patients with symptoms of brain ischaemia during atherosclerosis. Thirty patients received the drug orally for 2 months in doses of 100 mg thrice daily. Three patients discontinued the treatment earlier (two of them discontinued it because of side effects). After two months of treatment a significant improvement was observed in such disturbances important for wellbeing and social contacts as: anxiety and fear, mood depression, disequilibrium of emotion, motivation and initiative. In many patients headaches, dizziness and gait disturbances disappeared or diminished. Sulocton was useful in the treatment of patients with cerebral atherosclerosis.
