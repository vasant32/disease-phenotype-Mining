OBJECTIVE: To observe the efficacy of Yangxue Qingnao granule (YXQN) in treating cerebral arteriosclerosis and to explore its mechanisms. METHODS: One hundred and sixty-seven patients with arteriosclerosis were randomly divided into the treated group treated with conventional medical treatment plus YXQN and the control group treated with conventional medical treatment alone, to observe the changes before and after treatment in scores of chief symptoms, mean velocity of cerebral blood flow (VM), plasma nitric oxide (NO), calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) and endothelin (ET) levels. RESULTS: (1) After treatment in treated group, the scores of chief symptoms such as vertigo, headache and tinnitus were significantly lower than those in the control group (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01); (2) NO and CGRP level in the treated group after treatment obviously elevated, and ET and VM markedly reduced (P < 0.01), while no evident change of these parameters was found in the control group (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: The efficacy of YXQN in treating cerebral arteriosclerosis is definite, modulating the level of vasoactive factors was its important mechanism.
