Hypersomnia is described in 11 patients who have had a cerebral circulation episode with prevalent localization of the lesion in the oral divisions of the brain trunk. Three morphological observations are presented: these were cases of bilateral affection of certain meso- and diencephalic structures, e.g. medial divisions of the thalami and the diencephalon cover with involvement of the grey matter of the Sylvian aqueduct into the process. The observations presented confirm the opinion that the nonspecific structures of the meso- and diencephalic region are a part of the complex cortico-subcortical system participating in maintaining the state of wakefulness.
