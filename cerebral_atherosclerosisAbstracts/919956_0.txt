The authors accomplished a clinico-anatomical analysis of 8 personal cases of a rare vascular brain pathology. In 1 case there was a thrombembolism in the basin of fine branches of the right upper cerebellar artery with a focus of softening in the right hemisphere of the cerebellum in 1 case--thrombosis of the right upper cerebellar artery with a focus of softening in the right cerebellar hemisphere, in 5 -- thrombosis of the left lower posterior cerebellar artery with localization of the focus of softening in the left cerebellar hemisphere. One case was with thrombosis of the same vessel with a focus of softening in the right cerebellar hemisphere in the side olive of medulla oblongata.
