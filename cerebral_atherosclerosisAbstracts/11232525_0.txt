The aim of the study was to examine changes in vasodilatory endothelial function in early cerebrovascular disease of atherosclerotic genesis. All the examinees underwent ultrasonic investigation, test for reactive hyperemia of the brachial artery to evaluate vasodilatory function of the endothelium. Disturbances in the flow-dependent vasodilation were detected at initial stages of the disease, aggravated with the progress of cerebrovascular disease and therefore could serve the earliest, objective indicator of atherosclerotic process.
