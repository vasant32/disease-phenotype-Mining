PURPOSE: Because recent data are conflicting, it is not certain whether hyperlipidemia is an independent risk factor for cerebrovascular diseases. Decreased cerebrovascular reserve capacity refers to the decreased ability of the cerebral arterioles to adapt in critical conditions and probably predicts a higher risk of stroke. The aim of this study was to compare cerebrovascular reserve capacity in hyperlipidemic patients and healthy controls using transcranial Doppler sonography. METHODS: Thirty-four hyperlipidemic patients and 21 healthy controls were examined. With transcranial Doppler sonography, the mean blood flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery was registered at rest and at 5, 10, 15, and 20 minutes after intravenous administration of 1,000 mg acetazolamide. Cerebrovascular reactivity and reserve capacity were calculated from mean blood flow velocities. Various laboratory measurements were also made and assessed for correlation with resting cerebral blood flow velocity and cerebrovascular reserve capacity. RESULTS: No significant differences could be observed between controls and hyperlipidemic patients in cerebrovascular reactivity or cerebrovascular reserve capacity. No correlation was found between various laboratory measurements and resting cerebral blood flow velocity or cerebrovascular reserve capacity. CONCLUSIONS: We could not demonstrate any differences in cerebrovascular reserve capacity between hyperlipidemic patients and healthy controls. Thus, the vasodilatory ability of the cerebral arterioles seems to remain unchanged in this patient group and is not correlated with the severity of hyperlipidemia.
