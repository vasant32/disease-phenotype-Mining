The types of miliary cerebral aneurysms associated with hypertension were studied, using serial sections of blocks of brain tissue from hypertensive patients with a history of cerebral hemorrhage or lacunar infarcts or both. Four different structures were identified-three aneurysmal (saccular, lipohyalinotic and asymmetric fusiform) and one nonaneurysmal, the so-called bleeding globe. They probably account for all of the miliary cerebral aneurysms described during the past 100 years. The present survey is one of the most comprehensive yet undertaken.
