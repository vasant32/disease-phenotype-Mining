While performing carotid angiography in a 76-year-old man, we found that the right internal carotid artery repeatedly opened and closed during the examination. The patient experienced no related neurologic events. The explanation, confirmed at surgery, was that a flap associated with an atherosclerotic plaque had acted as a ball valve.
