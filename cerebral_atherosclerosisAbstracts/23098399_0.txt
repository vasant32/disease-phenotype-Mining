Aim of the given study was to elucidate special characteristics of mechanisms of development of atherosclerosis and supply of oxygen to the brain in overweight men and women. We included into this study 80 patients with multifocal atherosclerosis without history of myocardial infarction. We analyzed parameters of blood lipid composition, data of cerebral oxymetry, echocardiography, and central hemodynamics. We found gender linked differences in structural-functional parameters of myocardium and in mechanisms of progression of atherosclerosis which increased with increase of excess body weight. This was associated with differences in oxygen brain supply  between men and women.
