As a result of a comprehensive psychoneurological examination of 160 war veterans who had sustained a cranicocerebral trauma of a mild or moderate degree during the Great Patriotic War, the authors identified 3 variants of the clinical course of its long-term period: (1) late (at the age of 45-59 years), protracted (of many years) decompensation of a complex (polymorphic) posttraumatic neuropsychic defect; (2) a comparatively early (by age) and accelerated development of cerebral atherosclerosis and arterial hypertension with unstable compensation of posttraumatic cerebral, predominantly vegetative-angiodystonic disorders; (3) the prevalence in the clinical picture of the disease of marked manifestations of chronic cerebrovascular failure or stable sequels of brain stroke in the presence of individual reduced psychopathological posttraumatic symptoms. The article also presents electrophysiological, biochemical and psychological changes characteristic of each variant of the course, which should be taken into consideration in making the diagnosis and predicting the clinical and employment-related outcome.
