A study is presented of 42 patients with different stages of dyscirculatory encephalopathy of atherosclerotic genesis who showed disorders of the cerebral hemodynamics, microcirculation, increase of the aggregational capacity of thrombocytes and activation of lipid peroxidation. The patients were treated with corinfar and actovegin and this resulted in normalization of the microcirculation and rheological properties of the blood. Corinfar also reduced activation of lipid peroxidation processes.
