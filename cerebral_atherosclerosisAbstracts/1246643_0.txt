An analysis of one year's experience at our institution with 781 cerebral radioangiograms is reported. In patients who had follow-up radioangiographic evaluation, an overall accuracy of 88% was achieved using the anterior method. Accuracy in detecting carotid occlusive lesions alone was 83%. Detection of subdural hematomas by radioangiography was exceptional. Our results correlate well with those of others in detection of cerebrovascular occlusive disease, other vascular lesions, and avascular lesions. In our experience, the extremely high yield of information and the simplicity of performing radioangiography of the head and neck justify its routine use in all cases referred for brain scanning.
