OBJECTIVE: In order to provide morphological evidences for olfactory defect cased by olfactory bulb, olfactory tract ischemia, the origins, numbers, distributions and pathological changes about olfactory bulb, olfactory tract arteries were studied. METHOD: The distributions and pathological changes of olfactory bulb, olfactory tract arteries in 80 sides of adult brain specimens were observed with operation microscope, among which the nourishing arteries and nerve of olfactory tract in two sides aged from 60 to 70 were observed pathohistologically. RESULT: The blood supply of olfactory bulb, olfactory tract comes mainly form artery cerebral and posterior communicainy. 10% of these 60 sides arteries were of multi-branch. 86.3% of them had atheroselerosis. 25.0% of the olfactory bulb and olfactory tract artery were blocked or narrow, and pathological changes in olfactory nerve such as atrophy were observed. CONCLUSION: Excluding other diseases, the olfactory defect in different degree of patients over 60 years old were caused possibly by atheroselerosis of the arteries at base of the brain.
