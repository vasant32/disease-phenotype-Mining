 OBJECTIVE: The clinical trial, Japan Statin Treatment Against Recurrent Stroke (J-STARS), is being carried out to investigate the efficacy of statin treatment against recurrent stroke. To participate in J-STARS, patients must have a past history of ischemic stroke excluding cardioembolic events, and must be clinically diagnosed with hyperlipidemia (HL). Before starting J-STARS, we needed to be aware of the clinical characteristics of the patients who were eligible to participate in this study. METHODS: Between 1999 and 2002, 7,149 patients with ischemic stroke were enrolled in a stroke data bank developed by the Japan Standard Stroke Registry Study Group. From this, we acquired the data on 1,487 patients with first-ever atherothrombotic infarction (ATI) or lacunar infarction (LI) with a satisfactory functional outcome on discharge. RESULTS: Patients with HL were significantly younger (65.3+/-11.0 vs 68.4+/-10.9, p<0.0001) and showed a higher frequency of concomitant hypertension (70.9% vs 61.0%, p=0.0002), diabetes mellitus (42.2% vs 25.7%, p<0.0001) or both (31.7% vs 16.4%, p<0.0001) compared to those without HL. The ratio of ATI to LI and the frequency of prior ischemic heart disease (IHD) did not differ between the 2 groups. Among 467 patients with HL, 52.7% did not receive treatment on admission. CONCLUSION: ATI or LI patients with HL had an earlier age of onset and higher frequency of other lifestyle-related diseases, and this probably includes many with metabolic syndrome, whereas the frequency of IHD was not different between these 2 groups.
