Alkaline proteins play their pathogenetic part in the course of cerebral atherosclerosis the development of which is accompanied by decline in their content. It has been ascertained that in patients with early cerebral atherosclerosis and remote sequelae of mild closed craniocerebral injury (RS MCCCI) the content of alkaline proteins is below the established norm. The absence of significant differences between the patients presenting with early manifestation of cerebral circulatory insufficiency and those with RS MCCCI may suggest similarity of mechanisms of development of vascular disorders of traumatic and atherosclerotic genesis.
