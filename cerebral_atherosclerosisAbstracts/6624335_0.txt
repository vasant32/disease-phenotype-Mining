The results of investigations on the incidence of cerebral atherosclerosis and the distribution of lipid levels in the general population and among the first kin relatives of probands with cerebral atherosclerosis (CA) are presented. The correlation revealed between the signs under study showed them to be genetically determined. In 47.6% of cases, predisposition to CA was determined by genes regulating the level of triglycerides and in only 25%, by genes monitoring the level of cholesterol. The values of genetic correlations between the predisposition to CA and the level of individual classes of lipids are accounted for by the presence of genes displaying a pleiotropic effect on pair signs.
