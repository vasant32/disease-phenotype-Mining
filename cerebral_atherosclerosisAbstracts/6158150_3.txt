Moyamoya is an intriguing and controversial syndrome. This patient study serves to align the pathophysiology of intracranial hemorrhage in moyamoya with the cerebral vascular disease seen with hypertension, or aging. The historical evidence linking lipohyalinosis and microaneurysms to cerebral hemorrhage is reviewed, the pathogenesis of this angiopathy is discussed, and explanations considered for its association with the vascular pattern of moyamoya. We propose that hemodynamics, genetics or both are among the primary operant etiologic factors.
