A comparative analysis of changes in central hemodynamics and cerebral circulation depending on the technique of anesthesia used has been performed in 63 patients after reconstructive surgery on aorto-ileo-femoral segment. Signs of ischemic heart disease have been revealed preoperatively in 40 patients. The majority of them (88%) showed hypokinetic type of hemodynamics. Signs of cerebral atherosclerosis were found in 90% of patients. Rheoencephalographic index in them was lowered by 42%. A statistically significant deterioration in central hemodynamic and cerebral circulation parameters has been recorded immediately after the operation in patients with concomitant ischemic heart disease operated on under general endotracheal anesthesia. An improvement in central hemodynamic parameters after surgery has been observed in the group of patients operated on under epidural anesthesia.
