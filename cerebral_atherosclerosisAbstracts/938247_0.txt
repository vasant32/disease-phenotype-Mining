Visual-planimetric studies of atherosclerosis of the major arteries of the brain in 507 dead persons aged 30 years and older who had died of casual causes and diseases, were carried out. Collection and investigation of materials were conducted in accordance with the WHO programme (Uemura et al, 1964). Considerable differences in the degree of manifestation of atherosclerosis in the arteries under study and in the rate of their development in the course of life were established. The development of atherosclerosis in the extracranial arteries in men was more pronounced than in women. As to the degree of manifestation of the atherosclerotic process, incidence of stenosis of the investigated arteries inflicted more than 50 per cent of the lumen was not observed, there were no considerable differences between those who had died of complications of atherosclerosis with and without combination with hypertension. Marked pathologically convoluted and folded carotid and vertebral arteries were rare.
