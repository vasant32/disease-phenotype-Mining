A method for joining vessels by means of argon laser, i. e. by "laser welding" was developed. It was proved in experiment that endothelium formation is more adequate in a vascular microsuture formed by laser welding than in the formed by the traditional thread method. Forty one operations for creating an extraintracranial microanastomosis were found by laser welding. The prospective clinical effect was positive in 36 patients. Control angiograms demonstrated good patency of the created microvascular anastomosis.
