Scanty mast cells with high saturation and weak degranulation located perivascularly and in the subepithelial zone of the villi were detected in vascular plexuses of human brain. Cerebral atherosclerosis was associated with pronounced changes in their morphofunctional organization: changed shape, decreased volume and index of saturation and degranulation, predominating in the villous part of the vascular plexus of the lateral ventricle.
