The pathological findings of six autopsy cases of dissecting intracranial aneurysm are studied. Clinically, all cases exhibited systemic hypertension or left ventricular hypertrophy. Macroscopically, all cases exhibited rupture of the vertebral artery and subarachnoid hemorrhage. Two types of lesion were present. First, all cases showed the formation of a dilatated pseudoaneurysm with widespread disruption of the entire arterial wall, which was composed of thin adventitia. Second, a medial disruption of the arterial wall and subadventitial dissecting hemorrhage, which formed a false lumen and stenosis of the 'true' lumen of the artery, was also found. However, these lesions were found to be connected to the site of rupture. The autopsy cases within 1 day of onset of intracranial dissecting aneurysm showed the formation of fibrin thrombus, a marked degree of leukocyte infiltration and necrosis of the arterial wall at the site of the lesion. The cases that survived more than 1 week showed smooth muscle cell proliferation, macrophage accumulation and lymphocytic infiltration. No arteriosclerosis was found in any lesion studied. These data suggest that the disruption of the entire arterial wall might initially occur and cause medial disruption and subadventitial hemorrhage. Hypertension and arteriosclerosis might function as causal and protective factors in the pathogenesis of dissecting intracranial aneurysms, respectively.
