Gaseous metabolism and carboanhydrase activity of erythrocytes of the capillary and venous blood were studied in 115 persons, including 19 apparently normal subjects, 66 patients with ischemic stroke, and 30 with discirculatory encephalopathy. Patients with cerebral stroke presented gross disorders in the function of carboanhydrase and gaseous metabolism from the first day of the disease which was expressed in an increased oxygenation of the venous blood and hypocapnia, whose severity was correlated with the gravity of the disease course. The authors have established an important pathogenetic role in gaseous metabolism impairment of erythrocyte carboanhydrase, whose activity in the capillary bed in hypocapnia was drastically inhibited, compromising, therefore, the entry of carbon dioxide into erythrocytes, which deteriorated oxyhemoglobin dissociation. The authors consider the possibility of normalizing gaseous metabolism in stroke patients via eliminating CO2 deficit in tissues.
