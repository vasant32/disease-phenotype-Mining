Combined estimation of signs of cerebral circulatory disorders, the state of microcirculation and a degree of CHD was done in 111 male patients after myocardial infarction. Disorders in the system of the terminal bed which corresponded to the severity of clinical manifestations of disorders of coronary and cerebral circulation, were revealed in the overwhelming majority of the patients. The most noticeable changes in the terminal blood flow were observed in patients with marked clinical signs of atherosclerosis of the cerebral vessels. They also had a more severe course of postinfarction cardiosclerosis. Since noticeable microcirculatory disorders were detected in all these patients, it could be assumed that they were suggestive of the presence and severity of atherosclerosis. Symptoms of CNS lesion developed against this background and depended on the features of cerebral circulation and some other factors.
