The Authors investigated on the main lipidemic parameters in vascular diseases after acute administration of glucuronyl-glucosamine-glycan sulfate (3GS). The study was carried out in 48 subjects, aged 33 to 78, of whom 38 males and 10 females so divided: 6 metabolically healthy controls (N), 10 with vascular cerebral disease (VCD), 15 with coronary heart disease, 17 with peripheral vascular disease (PVD). Each subject, fasting and without drug treatment at least since 14 hours, after venous blood withdrawal, was given endovenous rapid bolus of 570 lipasemic units of glucuronyl-glucosamine-glycan sulfate (3GS); after 10', 20' and 30' other blood samples were taken; plasma NEFA (colorimetric method) triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC) and HDL-cholesterol (C-HDL) (enzyme method) were assayed; C-HDL/TC ratio was calculated and LDL-cholesterol value (C-LDL) according to the Friedwald-Fredrickson's formula was obtained. In controls NEFA increase after 20' (+ 57%) and triglycerides drop (-49%) were detected; TC significant fall (-13%, P less than 0,05) after 20' was found, preceded by both C-HDL marked increase and C-HDL/TC ratio, and followed (30') by C-LDL slight rise. In the 3 groups of vascular patients a striking NEFA increase (respectively + 50%, + 43%, + 26%) was found; in subjects with PVD/TG blunted drop was observed, whereas in VCD and in CHD TG percentage fall -41 and -44%) did not differ from that one of controls. Evident remarked in control, drop of total cholesterolemia, lacked in the 3 groups of vascular diseases; in patients with VCD and PVD C-HDL and C-HDL/TC ratio increasing profile was like normal, while in CHD both progressive reduction of C-HDL (-19% after 30') and C-HDL/TC ratio with C-LDL increase were appreciated. On the basis of their results the Authors believed that in PVD a striking deficit of total plasma lipoprotein lipase (LPL), already in vitro documented, may occur, whereas LPL resulted normal in VCD and in CHD; on the contrary, in CHD an abnormally cholesterol-apo-VLDL affinity, like metabolic atherogenic derangement, was found; in the 3 groups of vascular diseases slow peripheral cholesterol removal was detectable.
