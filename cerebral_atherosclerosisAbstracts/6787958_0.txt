In the purpose of studying their respective predictive value, beside the cardiovascular risk, the concentrations of B and (Apo) A1 apoproteins, cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL-cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol were estimated in a group of 110 patients (acute coronary insufficiency : 30 cases; recent myocardial infarction : 50 cases; cerebro-vascular accident : 30 cases) compared with the concentrations of an example group composed of 150 normolipemic subjects, presumed healthy. The concentrations of Apo A1 and HDL-cholesterol remain close in both groups, respectively to 1,6 +/- 0,33 mmol/l and 0,85 +/- 0,18. On the other hand, in the patients group, the concentrations of LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides and cholesterol are very increased in all the patients less than 60 years old; beyond they meet the ones of the control subjects with same age; the concentrations of the Apo B stay high in all the cases. In conclusion, the predictive value of the concentrations of HDL-cholesterol and of the Apo A1 remains very uncertain; it's much lower than the value of the concentrations of Apo B, major protein constituent of the atherogenic lipoproteins which are increased significantly whatever may be the age of the patient who show acute vascular accident linked to the atherosclerosis.
