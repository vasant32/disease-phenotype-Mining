Blood concentrations of total cholesterol, beta-lipoproteins, triglycerides and testosterone were studied in 73 men (mean age 65.9 +/- 8.6 years) with acute ischemic stroke. The concentrations of testosterone and triglycerides in men decrease with age and those of cholesterol and beta-lipoproteins do not depend on the age. In middle-aged patients, the negative correlations were found between concentrations of testosterone and beta-lipoproteins (r = -0.404; p < 0.05); testosterone and cholesterol (r = -0.273; p < 0.001). In elderly patients, there were negative correlations between concentrations of testosterone and triglycerides (r = -0.348; p < 0.05). In middle-aged and elderly patients, concentrations of triglycerides and testosterone were negatively correlated (r = -0.478; p < 0.001). The lower blood testosterone level was associated with the higher risk of the development of atherosclerotic lesions of major arteries that allowed to estimate risks of ischemic stroke in middle-aged and elderly men.
