Examination and treatment of 40 patients with atherosclerotic dementia demonstrated a significant increase in some indices of the hemocoagulation system. These changes were expressed in an increase of blood tolerance to heparin, shortening of the recalcification time, increase in the fibrinogen content, presence of fibrinogen B. The group studied was characterized by the presence of slightly marked fibrinolysis compensatory reactions. Treatment by novocain combined with aspirin led to appreciable changes in these indices towards normalization, permitting to consider this form of therapy as pathogenetic.
