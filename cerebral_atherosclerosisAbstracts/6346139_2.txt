An examination was made of the behaviour of platelet function after a single i.v. injection of 150 mg Buflomedil in 8 non-diabetic vasculopathic patients. The drug was followed by a significant reduction of the platelet aggregability induced by ADP and adrenaline, but not by collagen, and did not alter the percentage of reversible circulating platelet aggregates. Its action was limited in time, since no activity was observed after 24 hr. The drug was also clinically evaluated in 30 patients aged over 80 yr with chronic cerebrovascular insufficiency, following treatment with 100 mg/day i.v. for 20 days, and then 450 mg/day per os for 80 days. Significant improvements were noted in vertigo, tinnitus, lapses of memory, and the ability to remember numbers. The results were less impressive with regard to insomnia, migraine, and asthenia.
