This report is based on experiences with reconstructive vascular surgery for obliterative and aneurysmal vascular diseases in 5245 patients of the Surgical University Hospitals in Cologne and Munich during the last 15 years. An analysis of early and late results is given to illustrate the presnet standard of operative possibilities, but also their limitations in vascular diseases. This approach is used to give both vascular and general surgeons practical hints on procedure.
