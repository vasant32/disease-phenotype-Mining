We review the evolution of the concept of Binswanger's disease from his original description in 1894 to our days. We emphasize the conceptual impact caused by CAT scan. Finally, we propose a diagnostic triad based on clinical, neuropathological and radiological trends. We believe Binswanger's disease has a clear identity despite the lack of solid diagnostic criteria.
