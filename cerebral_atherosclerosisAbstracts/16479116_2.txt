BACKGROUND: Osteoporosis is a significant complication of stroke, and hip fracture after a stroke is a frequent problem. Moreover, growing evidence links vascular and bone diseases, in the form of osteoporosis associated with both atherosclerosis and vascular calcification. The aim of our study is to detect bone change in the acute phase of ischemic stroke in patients with carotid disease and to verify the correlation with carotid echogenic plaques. PATIENTS AND METHOD: Out of 245 subjects consecutively admitted to our Stroke Unit for their first ischemic stroke, we selected 49 patients with a first-ever stroke due to carotid atherosclerosis without a previous diagnosis of bone disease. We assessed risk factors for cerebrovascular disease as well as for osteoporosis, the degree of neurological deficit and disability, and bone mineral density that was quantified by bilateral hip dual energy X-ray absorbimetry. Osteoporosis was defined as a T score below -2.5. Carotid ultrasound was used to classify plaques in non-hyperechoic (grade 1) and hyperechoic plaque (grade 2). RESULTS: We found a high prevalence of low bone mass density (BMD) in our patients (18 out of 49=36.7%), without relationship to the side of paresis. According to univariate analysis evidence of osteoporosis was correlated with age (p=0.05), score of Scandinavian Stroke Scale (p=0.01) and grade 2 plaque (p=0.01). According to multivariate analysis, there was a significant positive correlation between grade 2 plaques and osteoporosis (OR=6.58; 95% CI=1.57-27.54; p=0.01), which was stronger in women (OR=18.15; 95% CI=1.80-182.83; p=0.01). The percentage of intraplaque hyperechogenicity was inversely correlated with BMD (r=-0.411, p=0.016). CONCLUSION: Osteoporosis is highly prevalent in acute atherosclerotic stroke patients. Carotid hyperechoic plaque is an independent marker of osteoporosis.
