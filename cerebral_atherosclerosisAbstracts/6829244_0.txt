Clinico-hemodynamic features as well as arterial hypertension outcome in 92 patients with hypertensive disease accompanied by atherosclerosis and atherosclerotic hypertension, who had suffered acute stroke in arteria caroticus interna areas 0.5-19 years before were followed up for 6 years. The minimal number of lethal outcomes fell within the first 3 years after stroke when hyperkinetic circulation was seen in all the patients. The lethality increase caused by repeated strokes (4-5 years after the first stroke was connected with gradual development of cardiac muscle pathology manifested by cardiac rhythm disorders or coronary and cardiac insufficiency in the patients with hypertensive disease in conjunction with atherosclerosis. Regressive course of arterial hypertension occurred in the patients with atherosclerotic hypertension 2 years after stroke. The frequency of repeated strokes did not increase in these patients. The lethality caused by cardiac muscle infarction was not increasing in the post-stroke period.
