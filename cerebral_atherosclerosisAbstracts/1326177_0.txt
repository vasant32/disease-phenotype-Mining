As many as 103 men who suffered myocardial infarction were examined for the clinical and functional manifestations of cerebral circulatory disorders as well as for the coronary heart disease at rest and during bicycle ergometry. The majority of the patients with postinfarction cardiosclerosis were found to have changes in the rheoencephalograms, augmenting with physical exercise. Those changes were most pronounced in patients with the clinical manifestations of atherosclerosis of cerebral vessels and in the presence of angina pectoris. The simultaneous recording of the rheoencephalogram and electrocardiogram during bicycle ergometry can be used for an all-round estimation of the reserves of cerebral and coronary circulation in patients suffering from coronary heart disease and elaboration of rehabilitation measures.
