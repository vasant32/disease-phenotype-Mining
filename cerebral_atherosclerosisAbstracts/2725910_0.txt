An epidemiological investigation of certain lipaemic parameters in some expressions of atherosclerotic disease with particular reference to HDL-cholesterol fractions is reported. The series consists of 94 normal weight subjects (45 m, 49 f, average age 61 +/- 5) subdivided as follows: 38 suffering from cerebral vasculopathy (group A), 41 from ischaemic cardiopathy (group B), 15 from peripheral vasculopathy (group C). One hundred controls aged between 41 and 70 and free from hepato-renal, endocrinometabolic and vascular diseases were also considered. In the case of each sample, plasma levels of triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C), HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C), HDL-3 cholesterol (HDL-3-C), HDL-2-cholesterol HDL-2-C), HDL-C/TC and HDL-2-C/HDL-C ratios were determined with the enzymatic method. In group A, an increase in TG (P less than 0.05) was observed with respect to the controls, while values of TC and LDL-C were slightly lower: values of HDL-C, HDL-3-C and HDL-2-C were decidedly down (P less than 0.01); the HDL-C/TC and HDL-3-C/HDL-C ratios were decidedly reduced (respectively P less than 0.05 and P less than 0.01). In subjects suffering from ischaemic cardiopathy (group B), TG values (P less than 0.05) were somewhat higher than the controls and TC and LDL-C did not differ significantly. The cholesterol fractions HDL-C, HDL-3-C (P less than 0.05) and HDL-2-C (P less than 0.05) and the ratio HDL-C/TC (P less than 0.05) were sharply reduced; the HDL-2/HDL-C ratio was normal.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
