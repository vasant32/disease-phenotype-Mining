OBJECTIVE: In this retrospective study we wanted to determine the role of cerebral revascularization in patients with symptomatic occlusive cerebrovascular disease. Special emphasis was put on subsequent cerebrovascular events, benefit in neurological functioning and bypass patency, as evaluated during the follow-up period. METHODs: A total of 73 superficial temporal artery to the middle cerebral artery bypasses were performed on 67 patients from 1986-2000. All patients exhibited a symptomatic occlusion of the internal carotid artery verified by angiography. All patients in our group were refractory to medical treatment. 65 patients (69 bypasses) with a mean age of 61 years (range: 38-79 years) were followed up over an average time of 44 months (range: 1.5-150 months). RESULTS: The peri-operative morbidity rate was 3% with no mortality. 55 patients (85%) had no further cerebrovascular events after surgery, and only 7 (11%) patients experienced another cerebrovascular event. 57 (88%) patients showed an improvement of symptoms after surgery and only 1 patient fared worse during the follow-up period due to a stroke he suffered two years after bypass surgery. 90% of all bypasses remained patent during the follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Although bypass surgery for occlusive cerebrovascular disease is still controversial, our retrospective study suggests both an improvement of symptoms and signs and a risk-reduction for future cerebrovascular events after surgery.
