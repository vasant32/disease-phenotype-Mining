Progression of atherosclerosis at extracranial carotid and intracranial arteries in patients with ischemic heart disease (IHD) is not well defined. We carried out a 5-year longitudinal study with magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of patients with IHD to assess the incidence of progression of atherosclerosis at extracranial carotid and intracranial arteries and to determine predictors of the progression. We previously performed carotid and intracranial MRA on 67 patients who had received selective coronary angiography for the clinical diagnosis of IHD. Of these 67 subjects, 41 patients gave informed consent to undergo MRA reexaminations to evaluate changes of extra- and intracranial arteries over a 5-year period. The degree of stenosis was divided into five grades depending on the narrowness of the arteries, i.e. normal, mild, moderate, severe and occluded. The average of follow-up period with MRA examination was 58.8 months. The progression of atherosclerosis, as defined as an increase of one grade of the stenosis rating, including both the exacerbation of pre-existing stenosis and the appearance of new stenotic lesions, were found in five patients (12.2%) for the cervical carotid artery and in only one patient (2.4%) for the intracranial artery. A multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that baseline carotid artery stenosis (P = 0.008), age (P = 0.047), and coronary events during the follow-up period (P = 0.048) were significant and independent predictors of progression of carotid atherosclerosis. In conclusion, our findings suggest that follow-up evaluation of the carotid artery is indicated for patients with IHD in whom carotid artery stenosis was detected on an initial examination. Further study is needed with larger numbers of patients to confirm these findings.
