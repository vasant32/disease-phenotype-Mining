The clinical picture and pathogenesis of the extrafocal symptoms were examined on the basis of 254 cases of hemorrhagic and 175 cases of ischemic strokes. The significance of these symptoms in the correct assessment of the site of the process is demonstrated. The following variants of the pathogenesis of the extrafocal symptoms in acute disorders of the cerebral circulation were identified: edema and swelling (cranio-basal compression and stem compression in the presence of a cerebellar hemorrhage); compression and dislocation (temporo-tentorial wedging and wedging of the cerebellar tonsils); secondary foci (at a distance and symmetrical); impairment of compensation in the earlier damaged structures; involvement of the functional systems (tonogenic and motor). The pathogenesis of the extrafocal symptoms was attributed to hemorrhagic and ischemic foci, death of neurons, focal histiolysis at a distance, etc.
