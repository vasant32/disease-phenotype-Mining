The paper describes the results of examining intracerebral blood flow in patient with different stages of dyscirculatory encephalopathies. Transcranial Doppler was applied. Ultrasound examination of the great arteries of the head was made by determining the linear and volumetric velocities of blood flow. Progressive cerebral atherosclerosis was found to result in an earlier decrease in cerebrovascular blood flow.
