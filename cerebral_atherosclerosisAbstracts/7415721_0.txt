Clinical and morphological studies of 73 cases of parkinsonism in patients aged 31 to 90 years were carried out. The following groups (types) of parkinsonism were differentiated: vascular, idiopathic, post-encephalitic, traumatic, toxic (after carbon monoxide poisoning), and of obscure etiology. cases of vascular parkinsonism constituting the largest group. Clinical and morphological features of parkinsonism of various etiology are described, including certain specific features of the disease in hypertensive and atherosclerotic patients. Forms underlain by a combination of the vascular and involutional-dystrophic processes are specified. An opinion is expressed that it would be erroneous to identify idiopathic parkinsonism (Parkinson's disease) as an involutional-dystrophic process with the post-encephalitic one.
