A man of 19 years of age was found to have a diffuse livedo, a quadruple asphyxic acrosyndrome, and dementia. Angiography confirmed the presence of distal ischemia with multiple circulatory blocks and a reduced distal network. The patient died at the age of 25 years and histopathological examinations of the vessels demonstrated obstructive atheromatous lesions in the medium sized and small arteries of the brain and viscera. By comparing these findings with those observed in three other cases, in which biopsy of the pulp of the toe was also performed, the hypothesis can be advanced that these juvenile encephalic ischemic accidents are caused by atheroma, which can be detected, at an early stage, by studying the distal arteries in the finger or toe pulp.
