We reported a rare case of marked dilatation of the bilateral common carotid artery (CCA) associated with stenosis of the left middle cerebral artery (MCA). A 64-year-old female was admitted with right hemiparesis and dysarthria. She was hospitalized 2 years ago for cholecystitis. For 5 years, she has been under medical treatment for hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, cardiac failure associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and atrial fibrillation. Brain CT scan showed infarction of the left corona radiata. Angiography revealed marked dilatation of the bilateral CCA and the internal carotid artery (ICA), moderate dilatation of the innominate artery and the right subclavian artery, kinking of the right CCA, diverticular outpouching of the left ICA, and stenosis of the right external carotid artery and the left MCA. Breast CT scan revealed moderate dilatation and marked calcification of the ascending aorta and the aortic arch. Laboratory examination did not show any sign of inflammation, rheumatoid factor (RA), antistreptolysis-O (ASLO) and antinucleotic antibody. Based on the clinical course, radiological findings and laboratory data, possible diagnosis of the dilatation of the bilateral CCA was discussed with particular emphasis on arteriosclerotic aneurysm and aortitis syndrome.
