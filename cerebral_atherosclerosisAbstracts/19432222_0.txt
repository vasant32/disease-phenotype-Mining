Patients with acute stroke have been examined, in order to determine the factors leading to disposition to stroke development and sufficiently predetermining the outcome. The relation between the risk of stroke development on the background of hypertension, atherosclerosis, heart pathology, diabetes mellitus, has been established. It has been shown that the majority of the above factors tend, as a rule, to develop with age. It has been established that complications in patients older than 60 years cause death in more than half of cases, while direct severity of vascular affection--in only one third of cases. Frequency of stroke complications makes practically 70%. At the same time, frequency of complications was 5 times higher in groups of patients with unfavorable outcome than in groups of patients with favorable outcome.
