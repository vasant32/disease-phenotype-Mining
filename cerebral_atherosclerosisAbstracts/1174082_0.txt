The effect of papaverihnydrochlorid (Panergon-R) on the cerebral circulation time was studied in 20 sclerotic patients by means of radionuclide circulography as established by a scintillation camera-computer system. After a 28-days period of treatment a mean effective change of circulation time of minus 10.6 +/- 4.8 percent was to be observed. This change was statistically significant.
