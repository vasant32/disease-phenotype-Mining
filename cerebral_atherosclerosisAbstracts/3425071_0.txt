Patients with cerebral atherosclerosis were examined for the parameters of lipid and peroxidation metabolism and their correlation with the gravity of the disease. The findings obtained included the development of moderate hyperlipidemia and intensification of lipid free radical oxidation. The levels of hyperlipidemia showed no significant variations in patients with cerebral atherosclerosis of varying severity whereas the levels of free radical oxidation of lipids directly correlated with the severity of the disease. The processes of free radical oxidation play a significant role in the pathogenesis of cerebral atherosclerosis.
