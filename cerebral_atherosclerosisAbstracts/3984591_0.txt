Using unified research methods the authors studied 25 clinically healthy subjects aged 20-25 years and 35 subjects aged 35-50 years as well as 25 patients with neurasthenia aged 20-25 years and 35 patients aged 35-50 years with initial cerebral atherosclerosis (ICA). On the basis of correlations carried out by statistical methods, the most informative manifestations of ICA (clinically evident or latent), general and differential diagnostic criteria of neurasthenia and ICA and also "risk factors" were specified.
