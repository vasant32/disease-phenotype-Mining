In 17 patients affected by atherosclerotic vascular disease and showing in basal conditions a hyperviscosity state, we have monitored the main hemorheological determinants during treatment with Suloctidil. At the end of treatment carried out for 5 months the results showed that erythrocyte filterability was the only hemorheological determinant influenced. The possible causes of this action are therefore considered.
