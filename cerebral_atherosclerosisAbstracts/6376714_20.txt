A randomised controlled trial of endarterectomy in patients with carotid artery disease showed that operation significantly reduced the frequency of transient ischaemic attacks (TIA) in the relevant vascular territory. Because of the high post-operative morbidity in the surgical group, the trial was abandoned before conclusions could be drawn as to the influence of endarterectomy on long-term survival or on the incidence of subsequent strokes.
