Fifty patients with endogenous and age-related organic psychoses (10 with schizophrenia, 6 with maniac-depressive psychosis, 11 with involution psychoses, 18 with cerebral atherosclerosis, 5 with senile dementia) were under this investigation. Characteristic of these were distinct depressions with suicidal tendencies. Clinical features of depression and suicidal manifestations were closely linked to age-related influences. Irrespective of nosology, depressive constructs simplified in aging with melancholic-dysphoric affect getting more and more pronounced. Distinct hypochondriac and relation delusions evolved and the feeling of solitude increased. Suicidal intentions became simple and primitively stereotyped, suicidal preparedness fell and suicidal attempts acquired increasingly impulsive nature. Severity and acuity of depressive experiences and suicidal attempts did not enhance with age.
