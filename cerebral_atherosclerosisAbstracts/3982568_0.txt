The present study has proved unequivocally the value of determining apolipoproteins A and B and the APO-L A/B quotient for establishing the risk for cerebrovascular disease. The determination of apolipoproteins should be preferred to the determination of HDL, LDL and VLDL, which has been practised so far. While only 30% of a group of 88 patients suffering from cerebrovascular disease had serum cholesterol levels of more than 250 mg/dl and approx. 57% showed HDL values below 40 mg/dl, a reduced APO-L A/B relation (less than 1.75) was demonstrated in 74%. A reduced APO-L A/B quotient was also observed in more than 70% of 62 CVD patients whose cholesterol level was within the range of normal. Determination of apolipoproteins may, therefore, be regarded as further progress in risk factor diagnostic of arteriosclerotic disease.
