Morphological examination of the brain in 17 autopsies of patients with arterial hypertension and cerebral stroke has revealed damage of the white matter of the large cerebral hemispheres of a focal and diffuse nature. The main role in stroke development is ascribed to changes in the intracerebral cortico-medullar arteries manifested in hypertension and persistent brain edema. The following 3 forms of white matter damage associated with arterial hypertension have been described: (1) multi-infarctional; (2) periventricular (periventricular spongiosis); (3) combined (diffuse).
