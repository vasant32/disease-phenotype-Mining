It was hypothesized that endothelial glycocalyx perturbation contributes to increased vulnerability of the arterial wall exposed to atherogenic risk factors. Glycocalyx and intima-to-media ratios (IMR) were studied at a low- and a high-risk region within the murine carotid artery (common region) and internal carotid branch (sinus region) in control C57BL/6J (C57BL6) and age-matched C57BL/6J/apoE*3-Leiden (apoE*3; on an atherogenic diet) mice. Electron micrographs revealed significantly thinner glycocalyces [73 (SD 36) vs. 399 (SD 174) nm, P < 0.05] and greater IMR [0.096 (SD 0.045) vs. 0.044 (SD 0.023), P < 0.05] at the sinus region of C57BL6 mice than in the common region. Thinner glycocalyces [100 (SD 27) vs. 399 (SD 174) nm, P < 0.05] and greater IMR [0.071 (SD 0.024) vs. 0.044 (SD 0.023), P < 0.05] were also observed in the common region of age-matched apoE*3 mice on an atherogenic diet for 6 wk vs. C57BL6 mice on a normal diet. Greater IMR were due to greater intima layers, without significant changes in media layer dimension. In addition, atherogenic diet resulted in increased endothelial cell thickness at the sinus region [0.85 (SD 0.49) vs. 0.53 (SD 0.28) microm, P < 0.05] but not at the common region [0.66 (SD 0.37) vs. 0.62 (SD 0.32) microm]. It is concluded that both regional and diet-induced increases in atherogenic risk are associated with smaller glycocalyx dimensions and greater IMR and that vascular sites with diminished glycocalyx are more vulnerable to proinflammatory and atherosclerotic sequelae.
