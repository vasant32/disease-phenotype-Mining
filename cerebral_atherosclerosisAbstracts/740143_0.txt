Vascular changes in the cerebral arterioles (150 - 500 mu) were demonstrated by means of magnification serial cerebral angiography (focal spot 0.15 mm) in a consecutive series of 25 hypertensive patients of advanced age suffering from cerebrovascular disease. The changes identified were: (a) arteriosclerotic lesions, (b) arteriolar occlusion, and (c) miliary aneurysms. The enhancement of vascular details obtained is essential to arrive at exact diagnosis and accurate clinical management.
