The author examined the function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid system (HPTS) in 618 patients with various forms of cerebral circulation disorders and also carried out experiments on 50 rabbits. The results of the clinical-laboratory and experimental studies elicited the role of the HPTS in the pathogenesis of cerebral circulation disorders. HPTS dysfunction was shown to impair the thyroid homeostasis which led to a reduction in the cerebral redox processes, imbalance between the coagulation and anticoagulation systems, and changes in the composition of blood trace elements. All these changes contribute to the development of cerebral circulation disorders.
