Of 32 patients (13 men and 19 women) with a mean age of 81.1 years committed to a mental hospital for senile or arteriosclerotic psychoses, 11 received 2% procaine hydrochloride according to Aslan's method, for an average of 13 months, 11 for 6 months, and 10 normal saline. Of 20 patients, with a mean age of 72 years, who attended the geriatric psychiatric clinic of a general hospital, 10 were treated with procaine hydrochloride and 10 with normal saline for six months. Procaine hydrochloride applied for six or 12 months did not appreciably alter the symptomatology and course of senile and arteriosclerotic brain disease. It did not improve the senile amnestic syndrome or neurological symptomatology, when present. The general mood and level of activity improved temporarily. It was also temporarily helpful in alleviating depressive symptoms in patients suffering from arteriosclerotic brain disease.
