The aim of this work is to study extracranial carotid lesions and their relation to some risk factors for atherosclerosis, in a large group of hemiplegic patients during rehabilitation treatment. The results indicate that in patients with stabilized ischemic stroke there is a high percentage of positive Duplex Scanner examination. However, the presence of negative patients with hemiplegia leads us, in this case, to look for a carotid lesion placed higher up. The high presence of bilateral atherosclerotic lesions also shows that atherosclerosis is not only a local process. The clinical event may be caused by the type of carotid lesion (as demonstrated by thrombosis or carotid lesions with superficial ulceration contralateral to the hemiplegia).
