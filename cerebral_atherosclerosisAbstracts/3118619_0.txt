In a study involving 126 subjects (61 patients with ischemic cerebral stroke, 25 clinically normal persons and 15 newborns) the authors have established differences in filtrability of erythrocytes of the capillary and venous blood, the range of physiological fluctuations of the elasticity of erythrocytes in capillary blood depending on alimentary factors, the absence of correlations between gas metabolism and erythrocyte filtrability under normal conditions and in minor stroke and the appearance of these correlations in grave patients. Neurovasoactive substances have been found to affect the degree of erythrocytic elasticity.
