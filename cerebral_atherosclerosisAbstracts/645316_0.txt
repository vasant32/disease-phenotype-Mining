The paper is related to a special study of the vascular brain pathology by REG methods in 50 patients with circular depressions. The REG data demonstrated changes of REG waves not only in the elderly patients, but in young patients as well. The study detected normalizing influence of electroconvulsive therapy on the REG indices which correlated with the clinical improvement. A REG study of brain vessels permitted to reveal different vascular conditions in circular depressions, which may be of definite significance fof differential diagnosis and adequate therapy.
