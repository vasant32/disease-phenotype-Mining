Forty-six patients with acute arteriosclerostic cerebral infarction were randomly divided into two groups: control group and treatment group. Each of them included 23 patients respectively. The patients in the control group were given Dextran-40 but the ones in the treatment group were given the mixture of Zuzhongping. The course of treatment was 3 weeks. It was found that there was a significant difference (P < 0.01) in the score percentage, before and after treatment of neurological defects, between the control group and the treatment group, and the former (29.70 +/- 33.52) was much lower than the latter (45.40 +/- 27.60). The total curative rate of the treatment group (87.0%, 20/23) was significantly higher than that of the control group (60.9%, 14/23). There was an obviously prolonged KPTT (kaolin partial thromboplastin time) value and a decreased Fb (fibrinogen) level in the treatment group. Before treatment they were 32.43 +/- 4.03 sec and 6.18 +/- 1.77 g/L respectively, but after treatment, 52.96 +/- 10.50 sec and 4.5 +/- 0.95 g/L respectively. The authors suggest that the significant therapeutic efficacy of Zuzhongping in the patients with acute arteriosclerostic cerebral infarction is related to its action of anticoagulation, modification of PGI2 and TXA2 level in the body, decreased blood Fb level, hyperglycemia, etc.
