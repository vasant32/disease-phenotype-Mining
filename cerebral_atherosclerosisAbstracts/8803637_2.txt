This study was designed in order to determine the diagnostic accuracy in imaging of the extracranial arteries by using magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), digital subtraction angiography (DSA), B-mode duplex ultrasonic examination (DUE) in comparison with the surgical and histological findings of the specimen removed after endarterectomy. The degree of stenosis of the arterial lumen of the surgical specimen was compared with the imaging findings of MRA, DSA and DUE: a) the degree of agreement of stenosis with histologic findings was found in 89% of cases for MRA, in 93% for DSA and 88% for DUE; b) the correlation of morphology of the plaque showed agreement in 91% of the cases with MRA, in 94% with DSA and 87% with DUE; c) the constitution of the plaque was in agreement with DUE findings in 96% of cases. There is no significant difference between the three methods, as far as the estimation of degree of carotid stenosis and morphology of the atheromatous plaque in the carotid arteries. MRA findings are similar with those of DSA and DUE with a high sensitivity and specificity concerning the constitution of the plaque. The combination of MRA and DUE provides all the necessary information concerning the extracranial segments of the cerebral arteries for the preoperative evaluation of patients with carotid disease.
