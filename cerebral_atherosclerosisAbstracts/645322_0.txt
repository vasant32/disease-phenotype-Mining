As a result of a clinico-psychopathological study of atherosclerotic hallucinatory-paranoid (endoform) psychoses the author eliminated 3 syndromological forms: 1) hallucinatory, 2) paranoid, 3) paranoid with their clinical variants. according to their development and clinical expression the endoform hallucinatory-paranoid psychoses are differentiated into acute transitory (exogenous type of reaction) and chronic progressive. Clinico-anotomical correlations demonstrated that of acute psychoses large focal changes are more typical, while of chronic--multiple small foci--brain lesions.
