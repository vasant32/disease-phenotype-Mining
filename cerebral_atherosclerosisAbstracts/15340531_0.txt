OBJECTIVE: Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), especially the immediate early (IE) gene of the virus, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. The aim of this study was to confirm the presence of HCMV IE gene DNA in intracranial artery walls and the association of the virus with the development of atherosclerosis. METHODS: HCMV IE gene was tested in formaldehyde-fixed intracranial arteries from 35 cases with cerebral atherosclerosis and 20 negative controls. In situ hybridization as well as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to detect the presence of DNA in sections of paraffin-embedded tissue samples. Probes and primers were derived from major immediate early (MIE) genomic regions of cytomegalovirus strain AD169. RESULTS: The DNA of HCMV was found in 40.0% and 10.0% of arterial walls with atherosclerosis and negative control group by in situ hybridization, respectively, in 60.0% and 30.0% by PCR, respectively. Significant deference was found between them (P=0.018, P=0.032). There was also significant difference between grade III-IV and grade I-II atherosclerosis by both methods (P=0.027, P=0.009). CONCLUSION: The results suggested that HCMV IE DNA exists in the atherosclerotic arterial walls, therefore, there might be an association between the IE gene in intracranial artery walls and the atherosclerosis. The arterial wall with the smooth muscle cells, might be the potential site of the virus persistence. HCMV may play a role in the pathogenesis of the atherosclerosis.
