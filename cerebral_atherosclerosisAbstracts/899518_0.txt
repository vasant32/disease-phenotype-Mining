On the basis of a pathomorphological and biochemical study of 22 cases with focal hemorrhages in atherosclerosis the author detected a contraction of nerve cells, adipose infiltration, "shadow-cells", a deposit of ferrum in the cytoplasma. The swelling of myelinic fibres was detected more often than hypermyelinization, fragmentation and demyelinization. Glia changes consisted in ameboid transformation and clasmatodendrosis. The maximum increase of the cholesterin amount was observed in pons varoli. Medulla oblongata and dentate nucleus and the minimum--in the cerebellar cortex and cerebrum hemispheres. The subcortical modes according to cholesterin growth and amount occupy the middle place. The connected cholesterin makes up 2/3 of the general amount.
