The paper demonstrates that mitochondrias of human brain cortex neurons take an active part in the vital processes of the cells, acutely react to brain circulation disturbances revealing various destructive and compensatory-restorative reactions. The observed forms of the mitochondrias damages are described. The compensatory-restorative reactions of the mitochondrias consisted in an increase of their number, size and the surface of the inner membranes. The authors make attempts to display correlations between the found changes of the mitochondrias and the clinical picture of the stroke.
