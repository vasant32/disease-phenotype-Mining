Using the universal morphological method recommended by WHO a comparative study of the gravity of cerebral atherosclerosis was carried out in groups of subjects with normal and elevated blood cholesterol levels. It was shown that in subjects with an elevated blood cholesterol level some grave forms of atherosclerotic changes (fibrous plaques, calcinosis, stenoses, and occlusions of the vessel lumens) were encountered more frequently than in subjects with normal blood cholesterol level.
