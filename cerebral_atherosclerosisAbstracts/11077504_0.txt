BACKGROUND: In the guidelines for follow-up of patients with established atherosclerotic disease, the importance of diet and other life style intervention strategies in reducing cardiovascular risk is emphasised. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In a survey in 363 general practices in 1997-99 we examined the diet of 3,160 patients with established atherosclerosis treated with a lipid lowering agent, and compared it with the diet of 530 persons interviewed in an omnibus survey, representative of the general Norwegian population above 40 years of age. A simple questionnaire was used for diet registration. We compared the quality of the patients' diet with their lipid levels and fulfilled treatment goals. RESULTS: A greater proportion of the patients used skimmed milk, polyunsaturated margarine and vegetable oil, and they ate less fat cheese and less fat meat compared to the other group. There were only small differences in the use of fish, fruit and vegetables. A more healthy diet in the patients reflected a better achievement of the treatment goals for blood lipids. INTERPRETATION: Patients with established cardiovascular disease seemed to have a more healthy diet than the general population. The use of fruit and vegetables has to be encouraged.
