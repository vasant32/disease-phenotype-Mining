 OBJECTIVE: The ankle-brachial blood pressure index (ABI) is an established clinical test for assessment of peripheral arterial disease and an indicator of generalized atherosclerosis. We investigated whether low ABI is associated with long-term functional outcome in patients with acute cerebral infarction. METHODS: We included 775 patients with acute cerebral infarction who were admitted within 7 days from stroke onset and had completed an ABI measurement during admission. Poor functional outcome was defined as a modified Rankin Scale of more than 2 at three months from stroke onset. The association between low ABI and poor functional outcome was analyzed using logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: A low ABI (<0.9) was present in 10.1% of patients. At three months from stroke onset, 16.9% of patients showed poor functional outcome (mRS > 2). After adjusting for conventional cardiovascular risk factors and the presence of cerebral atherosclerosis, a low ABI was independently associated with poor functional outcome (odds ratio 2.523, 95% CI 1.330-4.785, p = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: The presence of a low ABI was associated with an increased risk of poor functional outcome in patients with acute cerebral infarction. Screening for low ABI among stroke patients may be necessary to identify individuals at increased risk of poor functional outcome. Proper and individualized treatment for patients with a low ABI may improve long-term functional outcome following acute cerebral infarction.
