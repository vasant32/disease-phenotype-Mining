The pathogenesis and clinical manifestations of complete and focal cerebral ischemia are described. Special attention is paid to the recognition of TIA's, the non-invasive diagnostic possibilities (Doppler ultrasonic imaging, digital subtraction angiography, cranial computerized tomography), the medicamentous and surgical prevention of stroke. Cranial computerized tomography is important for the differential diagnosis of cerebral ischemia/cerebral hemorrhage. The pray and rehabilitation of patients with stroke are discussed. The possibilities of pharmacotherapy are critically reviewed.
