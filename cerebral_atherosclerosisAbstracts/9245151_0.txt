More accurate definition of the leading factors of development of discirculatory encephalopathy (DE) in patients with arterial hypertension was the aim of this investigation. The analysis of correlations between clinical and computer tomographical symptoms of DE on the one hand and the indices of central hemodynamics, head blood circulation and presence of atherosclerosis of head arteria on the other hand was performed. It was found that congestion in head venous system was the main factor in DE development. The conclusion was made that both atherosclerosis of head arteria and arterial hypertension promoted venous congestion in head by means of decreasing the amplitude of arterial pulsation and in turn the development of DE. Meanwhile, the increase of minute blood flow prevents it.
