Based on the established electrophoretic mobility of L-DOPA and on pathogenetic assumptions, the authors carried out multiple modality treatment employing transcerebral L-DOPA electrophoresis in 48 patients with postencephalic and atherosclerotic parkinsonism. The majority of patients (43 subjects) showed an improvement of various degrees, particularly when rigidity and oligo- and bradykinesia were predominant in the clinical picture of the disease. Of the 48 patients treated, 29 received L-DOPA per os and 19 patients were given low drug doses. The therapeutic effect persisted from 2 weeks to 2-3 months.
