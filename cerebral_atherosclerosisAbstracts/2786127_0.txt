Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and CO2-reactivity were investigated by the clearance of inhalation 133Xe on a 32-detector system in 33 patients with occlusion of the internal carotid artery. The patients were divided into 2 groups: with few symptoms and residual effects of ischemic insult of various degrees of expression. rCBF asymmetry was more noticeable in the 2nd group than in the 1st group. Different types of reactions to hypercapnia were noted. Three types of cerebral hemodynamics (stable, unstable and decompensated) were singled out on the basis of a study of rCBF and CO2-reactivity results. It is more advisable that patients with an unstable type of hemodynamics should be operated on.
