On the basis of clinical and EEG studies of 500 patients from the age of 45-105 with diffuse cerebral atherosclerosis the author comes to the following conclusion. With an intensification of atherosclerosis there is an increase of alpha-rhythm disorganization, a slowing down of the frequency, a drop in the amplitude and index of alpha-rhythms, a decrease in the electrical brain reactivity with an increase of delta-and theta-waves. It is shown that the EEG changes are to a greater extent determined by the severity of cerebral atherosclerosis than by age factors. Normal variants of the EEG in patients with expressed atherosclerosis is conditioned by the compensatory intactness of the cortico-subcortical systems generating these rhythms.
