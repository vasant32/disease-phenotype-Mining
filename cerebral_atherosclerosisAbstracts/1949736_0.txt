Evans blue dilution and ultrasound dopplerography was used to examine 170 atherosclerosis patients with initial manifestations of insufficient cerebral blood supply (77 patients) and transient disorders of the cerebral blood circulation (93 patients) with occlusive and stenotic involvements of the major brain arteries. The authors revealed characteristic aspects of responses of the systemic-hemodynamic mechanisms in initial manifestations of insufficiency of the cerebral blood supply and transient disorders of the cerebral blood circulation with stenosis and occlusions of the major brain arteries and without involvement of the brain vessels. Treatment aspects are discussed.
