An analysis of the complex examination of 170 patients with ischemic diseases of the brain has been made. Seventy patients were operated upon. Operations either in brachiocephalic branches or extra-intracarotid shunts were performed corresponding to the three established levels of the injuries. The nearest and remote results were obtained in more than 80% of the patients.
