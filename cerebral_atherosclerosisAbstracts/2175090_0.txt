As many as 115 patients with initial atherosclerotic discirculatory encephalopathy manifested alterations in the system of prostanoids towards vasoconstrictors and proaggregating agents, consequent on both reduction in the plasma of the metabolite prostacyclin and increase of the metabolite thromboxane. The alterations were found to be attended by activation of lipid peroxidation and deterioration of the cerebral and central hemodynamics. The treatment with the calcium antagonists verapamil and nifedipine favoured an increase in the content of prostacyclin and reduction of the content of TxB2. That was associated with improvement of the hemodynamic parameters. It may be assumed that the vasodilatory effect of the calcium antagonists is related to stimulation of the synthesis of prostacyclin . Besides, nifedipine treatment brought about a decrease in the blood plasma of lipid peroxidation products, which may be an additional factor of prostacyclin synthesis activation.
