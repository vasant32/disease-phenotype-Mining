BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to evaluate correlation of breath holding index (BHI) as functional parameter for intracranial subclinical atherosclerotic changes - we have shown in our previous works and arterial stiffness (AS-functional parameter for extracranial subclinical atherosclerotic changes) in normal population. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We included 120 healthy volunteers (conventional risk factors for cerebrovascular disease were excluded) who were examined at our Neurology Department. They were divided into 6 age groups-(25-35, 36-45, 46-55, 56-65, 66-75, 76+ years). We performed standard laboratory workup, body weight and height measurements, Color Doppler and Power Doppler of the main head and neck vessels and Transcranial Doppler, (measured by means of e-Tracking software). RESULTS: There was decline of BHI, and increase in AS - in correlation with age increase (p<0.01). There was statistically significant negative correlation between BHI and AS (r= -0,931, p<0.01 right and r = -0,938, p<0.01 left). CONCLUSION: These results show that decline in BHI as parameter for intracranial microvessel dysfunction is in good correlation with increase of AS as functional parameter of extracranial vascular aging.
