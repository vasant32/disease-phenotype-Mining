Risk factors were compared in 300 patients with brain stroke and 120 patients with neurosis or sciatic pains. It was found that arterial hypertension (p = 0.001) and diabetes (p = 0.01) were significantly more frequent in cases of brain stroke. Disturbances of lipid metabolism, tobacco smoking and obesity showed no significant difference. Extracerebral atherosclerosis (p = 0.001) increased the risk of stroke. Coronary arterial disease was most frequent (48.8%), myocardial infarction (8.3%) and calcifications in the aorta (32%) were second and third in frequency. Presence of at least two risk factors may be an indication to prophylactic treatment.
