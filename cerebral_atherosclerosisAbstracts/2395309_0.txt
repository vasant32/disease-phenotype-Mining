The authors report on 2 patients with extreme kinking of the internal carotid artery and ipsilateral, recurrent ischemic optic neuropathy associated with localized microangiopathy of the retinal nerve fiber layer (cotton wool spots). In conjunction with the kinking phenomenon, the atheromatous plaques represent a potential cause of dangerous embolization causing ocular symptoms. The kinking phenomenon may not be diagnosed by Doppler sonography, including duplex B-scan evaluation, and digital subtraction angiography may be necessary. Extreme kinking of the internal carotid artery, which causes ocular embolisms, must be recognized and treated immediately by angioplasty to prevent damage to the eyes and brain.
