Sudden and large increase of the blood pressure may be life-threatening, particularly when they are accompanied by encephalopathy, left-ventricular insufficiency or other complications. The crisis of hypertension shall be treated possibly without loss of time and with energy. If there is the possibility for a permanent control of the patient, the infusion by drops of nitroprusside sodium is the therapy of choice. It at once decreases the blood pressure and is free of side-effects. Diazoxide has the advantage compared with nitroprusside sodium that an intravenous injection decreases the blood pressure for several hours.
