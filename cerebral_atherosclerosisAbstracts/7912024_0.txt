The paper shows that intravenous administration of trental, curantil, cavinton and sermion to cerebrovascular deficient patients causes a decline in blood circulation rates in the extracranial part of the carotid arteries. Sermion exhibited a biphase reaction: an increase in the blood flow followed by a decrease 15-30 minutes after introduction in the carotid arteries. Trental and curantial act in the intracranial arteries as moderate vasodilators reducing blood flow speed and blood vessel resistance. Cavinton activates intracranial blood flow, especially in the cortical segments of the middle cerebral arteries. Sermion initially increases blood flow rate in the middle cerebral arteries, than decreases it, especially in segments M2 and M3. Cavinton and sermion intravenous infusions are beneficial in cases of arterial hypertension.
