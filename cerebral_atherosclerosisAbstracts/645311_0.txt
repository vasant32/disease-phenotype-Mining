The paper is concerned with a study of the effect of metamizil in 45 patients with different forms of vascular parkinsonism. It was established that metamizil exerts a positive effect on the development of neurological symptoms (rigidity, bradykinesia, tremor) in mild and moderately expressed degrees of lesions. In most of the cases the drugs appeared effective in doses of 0.001 g thrice daily, and in separate cases 0.001 g 6 times daily. In the majority of patients metazil was tolerated without significant side effects. In some patients the side effects (vertigo, dryness in the mouth) were slightly expressed. The effect of treatment was seen after 2 days up to 2 weeks and lasted during the whole course of treatment and sometimes after it. Metamizil possessing a moderate sedative action, as well as spasmolytical and hypotensive is indicated for patients with vascular parkinsonism.
