Experiments on 30 rabbits, as well as clinical studies on 180 patients with cerebral circulation disorders were carried out. It was found that in patients with hypertensive disease complication, thyroid hyperactivity was observed only in the age group of 35 to 45 years. It was also found that in the patients with hypertensive disease and the complications of the latter, repeated stresses intensified the neurosecretory functions of the hypophysis and the hypothalamus: this, in its turn, influenced the hormone-synthetizing function of the thyroid. The chronic hyperthyroid syndrome present in those patients led to an increased oxygen consumption by tissues, slowed down the electron transport along the respiratory chain, increased the content of iodine and protein, and intensified the effects of pressor agents, i. e. aggravated the symptoms of the hypertensive disease. All those factors play a definite role in the mechanism of the development of the cerebral circulation disorders in hypertensive patients.
