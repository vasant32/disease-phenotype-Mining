BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of systemic blood pressure-lowering treatment with an angiotensin II receptor blocker, valsartan, on cerebral hemodynamics in patients with hypertension and evidence of cerebral small vessel disease. METHODS: We used positron emission tomography and acetazolamide challenge tests to measure cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebrovascular reserve (CVR) in 8 patients with hypertension (mean age 70.8 years) with lacunar infarcts and white matter lesions before and after valsartan therapy. RESULTS: Systemic blood pressure was significantly decreased from baseline after treatment with valsartan. The baseline global CBFs before and after treatment were 38.2 +/- 5.6 mL/min/100 g and 39.9 +/- 9.0 mL/min/100 g, respectively. The CVRs before and after treatment were 52.2 +/- 18.4% and 39.7 +/- 18.9%, respectively. Differences in these parameters were not significant. Both regional CBF and CVR in the corona radiata with moderate or severe white matter lesions were also preserved after valsartan therapy compared with those before treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Cerebral hemodynamics were preserved after blood pressure lowering with valsartan therapy. Valsartan could be a feasible antihypertensive regimen in terms of cerebral circulation in patients with cerebral small vessel disease.
