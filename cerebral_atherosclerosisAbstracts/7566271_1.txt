Two different methods of quantifying arteriosclerotically changed vessel walls of carotid arteries were compared: the two-dimensional method of measuring intima and media thickness (IMT) and the three-dimensional measurement of plaque volume. The results of 433 carotid arteries in 174 patients indicate a positive correlation in measurements of IMT between internal and common carotid arteries (P < 0.001), but no correlation between IMT measurements and three-dimensional measurements of plaque volume. For follow-up studies of carotid artery disease the three-dimensional volume measurements are the best method of evaluating progression or regression of focal plaque volume.
