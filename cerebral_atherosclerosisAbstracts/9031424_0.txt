In order to elucidate the relationship between the lipoprotein profile and large cerebral artery atherosclerosis in the young adults living in developing Asian countries, the serum lipoprotein profile and the luminal diameter of large cerebral arteries (internal carotid, middle/anterior cerebral and vertebrobasilar arteries) were measured and correlated in 67 young Taiwanese with non-embolic cerebral infarct (CI). Totally 23 (21.9%) patients had atherosclerotic stenosis. A significant elevation of the serum total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride, total lipids, beta-lipoprotein (beta-LP) and pre-beta-LP level was found in atherosclerotic CI patients. But multiple regression analysis showed only the serum beta-LP (p = 0.0041) and TC (p = 0.0324) level to be the independent risk factors for atherosclerosis. Secondary dyslipoproteinemia is the main cause for hyperlipoproteinemia in our atherosclerotic patients. Therefore, an abnormal lipoprotein profile is linked to large cerebral artery atherosclerosis in young Asians regardless of ethnic group. A tailored program is recommended to modify the life style and dietary habit, as well as to gain access to secondary control for large cerebral atherosclerosis prevention in developing countries.
