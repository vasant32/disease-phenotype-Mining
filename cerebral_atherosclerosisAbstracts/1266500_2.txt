By using clinical and zonal REG methods the authors examined 204 patients with brain traumas. Such examinations permitted to detect symptoms of a disturbed cerebral vascular tone. In the acute period of a closed brain trauma changes of cerebral hemodynamics were not stable and were nonhomogenous by direction. A differential qualification of the general and cerebral hemodynamics in the remote period of a closed brain trauma permitted to distinguish 4 types of cerebral vascular disorders. The obtained results facilitate an objective assessment of brain traumas and their pathogenetical treatment.
