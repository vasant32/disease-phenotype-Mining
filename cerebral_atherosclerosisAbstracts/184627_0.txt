The results of the conducted studies testify to the existence of a certain correlation between the stage of the pathological process and immunological reactions to brain antigens and vessels in patients with cerebral atherosclerosis. In the I and II stages of cerebral atherosclerosis there is a certain predominance of seropositive reactions to brain beta-lipoproteids. In transient disorders of brain circulation there were prevalent reactions to water soluble proteins of the vascular tissue. In patients with residual symptoms of ischemic strokes the most frequent findings were seropositive reactions to brain proteins and beta-lipoproteids.
