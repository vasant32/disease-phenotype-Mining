Forty-one patients with dyscirculatory encephalopathy complicated by a transient impairment of the cerebral circulation were examined in a neurological department. A comparative analysis of the findings obtained during comprehensive study of the cerebral circulation showed that in the overwhelming majority of cases (37 out of 41), the results of isotope angiography and rheography coincided and corresponded to the clinical findings. To a certain degree these methods complemented each other: rheoencephalography was more informative in the diagnosis of cerebral atherosclerosis and essential hypertension while radioisotope angiography allowed a more accurate determination of the area affected.
