Using rheoencephalography and gamma-scintigraphy, the cerebrovascular action of nifedipine was studied in 38 patients with an ischemic stroke and chronic cerebrovascular insufficiency. In patients with a crisis-like increase in the blood pressure, the drug induced a rapid and considerable drop in the blood pressure, a decrease of the tone and an elevation of the blood content of the cerebral vessels. In patients with a moderately elevated stable BP, this effect was less marked. An increase in the cerebral blood content was mostly seen in the zones of the arteries of the predominantly muscle type. It was effected by both the vasodilating action of nifedipine and the autoregulatory mechanism. Nifedipine did not induce the effect of intracerebral steal and did not impede the outflow of blood from the intracranial veins.
