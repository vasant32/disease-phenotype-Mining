The effect of vincamine on initial cerebrovascular insufficiency was examined by investigation of data relating to 828 patients from 11 centres. Most had received 6 tablets/day for 30 days. The method selected in gathering the data and their processing is described. Classic symptoms of initial insufficiency were considered after 7, 14, 21 and 30 days and evaluated along with a "seriousness" index relating to the symptomatology as a whole. The results pointed to continuous improvement in individual symptoms and overall from the outset of treatment, eventually leading to high remission percentages. Tolerance was generally good and very few cases of side-effects were reported.
