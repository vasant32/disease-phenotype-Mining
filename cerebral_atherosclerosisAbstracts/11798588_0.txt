OBJECTIVE: To understand the knowledge, attitude and behavior (KAB) of Chinese health professionals and the affected factors in stroke. METHODS: 1722 anticipated participants were selected by stratified-random sampling, actual participants were 1609. Out of these participants, 1,537 were eligible for analysis. The data were gathered through self-administrated questionnaire. RESULTS: More than 70% of the health professionals selected the correct answers to some questions, but only 25.7% realized that cerebral arteriosclerosis is the most important cause of ischemic stroke. 57.8% and 48.1% of the health professionals suggested and helped patients to reduce weight and restrict salt, respectively; but only 28.0% suggested and helped patients to do physical exercise in non-acute phase. Analyses of multiple linear regression showed that health professionals' education, title, specialty and training in prevention and control of cardiovascular disease as well as the cardiovascular disease history of patients' family members were positively, significantly and independently related to KAB score. CONCLUSION: Health professionals' KAB score about stroke was low on average, health promotion is the access to improvement of health professionals' KAB level.
