OBJECTIVES: The paraoxonase (PON) gene can reduce the risk of developing atherosclerosis. We investigated the associations between PON polymorphisms and ischemic stroke. We also investigated the associations between PON polymorphisms and lipid profile in stroke patients. METHODS: A total of 350 patients with ischemic stroke and 242 control subjects in Korean population were genotyped for the PON1M55 L, PON1Q192R, PON2A148 G and PON2S311C polymorphisms using melting point analysis with LightCycler real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in genotype and allele distribution of the PON polymorphisms between the ischemic stroke patients and control subjects. The concentration of total homocysteine was significantly different in the PON1M55 L polymorphism (P = 0.047), and the apolipoprotein (Apo)B concentration was significantly different in the PON1Q192R polymorphism (P = 0.02) in stroke patients. The concentrations of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and ApoB were significantly different between the PON2A148 G (P = 0.011, P = 0.000, respectively) and PON2S311C polymorphisms (P = 0.046, P = 0.003, respectively) in stroke patients. CONCLUSIONS: This study did not provide association between PON gene polymorphisms and ischemic stroke. However, it confirmed that the PON1L55 L allele is associated with plasma concentration of total homocysteine and that the PON2G148 G and PON2S311S allele is associated with plasma concentrations of LDL cholesterol and ApoB.
