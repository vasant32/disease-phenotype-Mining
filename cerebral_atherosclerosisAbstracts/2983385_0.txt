The examination of 91 patients was undertaken in order to establish the relevance of tomographical measurement of the regional cerebral blood-flow, following inhalation of 133Xenon, as a complementary method to the conventional carotis-angiography. In many cases the findings revealed a more precise or even deviating judgement on the hemodynamic relevance of stenosis and obliteration than was proved only by angiography. Especially in the stages I and IV of cerebrovascular disease of the a. cerebri anterior, a. carotis interna and a. carotis communis the rCBF-measurement seemed to be an important parameter for the decision between conservative and surgical therapy as a prognostic parameter for the individual risk of many patients to suffer a cerebral infarction.
