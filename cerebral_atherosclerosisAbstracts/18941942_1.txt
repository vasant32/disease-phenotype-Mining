Takayasu's arteritis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the aorta and its main branches, and a well known cause of stroke. Pathogenesis of ischaemic stroke has been attributed to intracranial vasculitic involvement or emboli from either stenoocclusive extracranial vessels or cardiac disease such as aortic regurgitation. We present a patient with Takayasu's arteritis and recurrent cerebral infarctions associated with intracranial atherosclerosis. We postulate that the intracranial atherosclerotic process is an important mechanism in Takayasu's arteritis-related ischaemic stroke.
