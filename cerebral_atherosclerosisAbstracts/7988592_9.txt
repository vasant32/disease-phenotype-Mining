High body iron stores have been proposed as a risk factor for advanced atherosclerosis. We investigated the prevalence of early atherosclerotic changes, and their relation to conventional CHD risk factors and body iron status. A cross-sectional study was carried out in 206 men aged 50 to 60 years (6% random population sample). Intima-media thickness (IMT) of the carotid artery was evaluated with high-resolution B-mode ultrasonography. Statistical analyses were performed separately for men with and without cardiovascular disease (CVD). Among all the study participants, 6.6% had IMT > 1.3 mm in the common carotid artery, whereas 53.8% had IMT > 1.5 mm in the carotid bifurcation. Respective values were 4.8% and 46.8% for those without CVD, and 8.5% and 62.2% for those with CVD. Mean IMT in the carotid bifurcation, the predilection site for atherosclerosis, was 1.85 mm (95% CI 1.72; 1.98) in the men with CVD, as compared to 1.65 mm (95% CI 1.56; 1.73) in the men free of CVD. Serum LDL cholesterol (beta = 0.26), saturated fat intake (beta = 0.20), blood haemoglobin (beta = -0.29), systolic blood pressure (beta = 0.21) and smoking (beta = 0.19), jointly explained 23% of the variance in the carotid bifurcation IMT in the men without CVD. Neither serum ferritin, transferrin nor dietary iron levels were associated with carotid bifurcation atherosclerosis. On the other hand, in the men with CVD, age (beta = 0.34) and physical activity (beta = -0.25) jointly explained 16.5% of the IMT variance in the carotid bifurcation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
