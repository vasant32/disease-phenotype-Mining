The efficacy of sermion was studied in 41 patients of the middle and elderly ages. The reactive changes in the parameters of the cerebral circulation (the frontomastoidal RhEG), total hemodynamics, frequency-integration characteristics of EEG and visual evoked potentials at the administration of 2 mg and 4 mg of sermion were shown. There are given recommendations for the differential approach to the choice of the drug doses in the elderly persons taking into consideration the parameters of the background reactivity of the CNS and the state of vascular regulation.
