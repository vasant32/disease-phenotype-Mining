Brain vascular diseases are ranked the third as the cause of morbidity and mortality in majority of the countries of the world. In about 80% of the cases of vascular brain diseases, it is ischemic brain disease (IBD). Atherosclerosis of main cerebral arteries is most frequently responsible for the occurrence and development of IBD. In recent years it was reported for the first time of the association of atherosclerosis and/or its complications and proteinuria. Assuming that there exists the significant association between the degree of proteinuria and clinical parameters of IBD, the aim of this study was to investigate the frequency and patterns of the association of proteinuria and clinical IBD parameters. The study was performed in 180 patients with IBD of atherothrombotic origin and 60 patients with the diseases of non-vascular origin, as the control group. In all patients quantitative determination of proteinuria was performed, and in the patients with IBD was determined the degree of IBD and afterwards the degree of functional and neurologic impairment prior to and at the end of treatment in acute phase using the standardized scales. The results of the study revealed the existence of significant frequency of proteinuria in the patients with IBD, as well as the significant association between the degree of proteinuria and severity of IBD. It was concluded that proteinuria in patients with IBD was probably associated with the atherogenic processes and physiopathologic processes of IBD, respectively, which could have predictive value for the outcome of the disease in the early stage.
