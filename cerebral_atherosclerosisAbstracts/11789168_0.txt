OBJECTIVE: To investigate the risk factors of cerebral arteriosclerosis (CAS) in the special population--the old cadre in organizations affiliated directly under Fujian Province. METHODS: The investigation was carried out according to the case control method of epidemiology and conditional logistic regression model was used. RESULTS: Multivariate analysis showed that CAS was closely related with the clinostatic systolic blood pressure (CSBP, OR: 2.13), triglyceride (TG, OR: 2.08), diabetes mellitus (OR: 1.31), glycosylated hemoglobin (OR: 1.16), recall of portrait characteristic (OR: 0.89), Kidney-Deficiency Syndrome (OR: 1.54) and Yin-Deficiency with Yang-Excess Syndrome (OR: 1.59). And there was a quantity-effect relationship between CSBP, TG and CAS. CONCLUSION: CSBP is the most important risk factor of CAS in the special population of the old cadre, and the TCM Syndromes of Kidney-Deficiency and Yin-Deficiency with Yang-Excess are also independent risk factors of CAS.
