BACKGROUND: We report the incidence of new coronary events and new atherothrombotic brain infarction (ABI) in older men and women with diabetes mellitus, prior myocardial infarction, and a serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol of >/=125 mg/dl treated with statins and with no lipid-lowering drug. METHODS: The incidence of new coronary events and of new ABI was investigated in an observational prospective study of 529 diabetics, mean age 79 +/- 9 years, with prior myocardial infarction and a serum LDL cholesterol of >/=125 mg/dl treated with statins (279 persons or 53%) and no lipid-lowering drug (250 persons or 47%). Follow-up was 29 +/- 18 months. RESULTS: At follow-up, the stepwise Cox regression model showed that after controlling for other risk factors, the use of statins was associated with a 37% significant independent reduction in the incidence of new coronary events and with a 47% significant independent reduction in the incidence of new ABI. CONCLUSIONS: Use of statins was associated with a 37% significant, independent reduction in new coronary events and a 47% significant, independent reduction in new ABI in older men and women with diabetes mellitus, prior myocardial infarction, and a serum LDL cholesterol of >/=125 mg/dl. Elderly diabetics with prior myocardial infarction and increased serum LDL cholesterol should especially be treated with statins.
