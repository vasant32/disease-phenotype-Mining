The spectrum of HLA antigens was studied in 619 control subjects and 357 patients with atherosclerosis of various localization (coronary, cerebral, and lower limbs arteries). Comparative analysis has shown both agreement and differences to exist between patient groups depending on atherosclerosis localization. Significant differences were also found in the level of various lipid components. A relationship between HLA antigens and lipid markers was demonstrated, especially between locus B and C antigens and HDL cholesterol level. The authors believe the findings can be utilized to determine predisposition to atherosclerosis of various localization.
