Intravenous digital subtraction angiography (DSA) was performed in 111 patients with vertebrobasilar ischemia. Ninety percent of the vertebral images were of diagnostic quality; 23% of the basilar images were good quality and 53% fair quality; and 58% of the posterior cerebral images were poor. Compared with selective film arteriography in 23 patients, DSA tended to underestimate the degree of atheromatous disease. Segments of the basilar artery were often poorly seen, which could result in false-negative errors. DSA can provide a general assessment of atheromatous disease of the brachiocephalic vessels, including the vertebral and carotid arteries, and in many cases can exclude occlusion or critical stenosis of the vertebrobasilar system. However, it does not adequately image the posterior cerebral or cerebellar artery.
