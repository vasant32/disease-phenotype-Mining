Cerebrovascular ring-like fat deposition, which was noted only in hypertensive rats but never observed in normotensive rats even after they had been fed a high-fat cholesterol (HFC) diet for a long time, was successfully developed in the posterior communicating or other cerebrobasal arteries in normotensive rats fed an HFC diet for ten weeks after bilateral or unilateral carotid artery ligation or basilar artery ligation. These posterior communicating arteries with fat deposits were clearly dilated to a significant extent. These findings corroborated the fact that not only high blood pressure but also hemodynamic derangements induced by hypertension or other causes were important factors for the development of fat deposition in cerebral arteries.
