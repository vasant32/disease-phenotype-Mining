OBJECTIVES: This clinical study investigated the prevalence of cervical and cerebral atherosclerosis and silent brain infarction in patients with coronary artery disease. METHODS: Cervical and cerebral magnetic resonance angiography(MRA) was performed in 133 patients (98 males, 35 females, mean age 65.3 years) with suspected coronary artery disease, who were divided into a zero- and one-vessel disease group(n = 71) and a two- and three-vessel disease group(n = 62) depending on the number of major coronary branches with 75% or more stenosis. The MRA lesion was defined as more than 50% stenosis. Magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) of the brain was performed within 1 week of MRA in 78 patients without symptomatic stroke and atrial fibrillation. Silent brain infarction on MRI was defined as a focal high intensity area on T2-weighted images larger than 3 mm. RESULTS: The prevalence of MRA lesions was significantly greater in the two- and three-vessel group than in the zero- and one-vessel group(53% vs 14%, p < 0.01). The prevalence of MRI lesion was significantly higher in the two- and three-vessel group than in the zero- and one-vessel group(77% vs 36%, p < 0.01). The size and number of the MRI lesions were also significantly greater in the two- and three-vessel group than in the zero- and one-vessel group(p < 0.01). Neither age nor percentage of male gender was different between the groups. Diabetes mellitus was the common risk factor for coronary artery disease, MRA lesion and MRI lesion. CONCLUSIONS: Cervical and cerebral atherosclerosis and silent brain infarction are frequently observed in patients with multivessel coronary artery disease.
