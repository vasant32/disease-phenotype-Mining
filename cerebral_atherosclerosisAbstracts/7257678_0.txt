Results of the first four-year stage of long-time (planned for 15 years) examinations of the brain bioelectrical activity in 97 patients (aged 40 to 59 years) with initial signs of cerebral atherosclerosis are presented. A relative stability of the oscillatory process regularities was ascertained at annual examinations and courses of etiopathogenetic therapy. The frequency parameters of the alpha-activity were found to undergo certain age charges that took place in the presence of the relative increase of the share of low-frequency and dominantless curves.
