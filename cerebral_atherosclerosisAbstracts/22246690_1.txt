The Stenting and Aggressive Medical Management for Preventing Recurrent Stroke and Intracranial Stenosis (SAMMPRIS) trial, a randomized clinical trial comparing aggressive medical management to stenting with aggressive medical management for symptomatic intracranial stenosis, was prematurely halted when a high rate of periprocedural events was found in the stent arm. The trial also demonstrated a high rate of stroke with medical management. This article explores possible reasons for these outcomes and discusses some weaknesses of the trial. Against this background endovascular therapy should continue to be explored in the treatment of this disease.
