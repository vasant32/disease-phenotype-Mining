A total of 140 patients with atherosclerotic encephalopathy were subjected to a multiple modality treatment. The efficiency of the treatment with (n-90) and without (n-50) hemosorption was compared. The results of the treatment were assessed by neurologic and neuropsychological examinations, spectral analysis of the EEG and the study of blood lipids. Hemosorption was found to be highly effective in the treatment of patients with atherosclerotic encephalopathy, which was expressed in the regression of clinical manifestations, a positive time-course of the electrical activity of the brain and lipid metabolism indicators.
