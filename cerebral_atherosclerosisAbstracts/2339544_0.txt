It has been found that the drug sermion (nicergoline)--a synthetic ergot alkaloid with alpha-adrenoblocking action--produces a pronounced vasoactive (spasmolytic) effect in the elderly patients suffering of initial atherosclerotic encephalopathy. A course of sermion treatment improves, via its effect on the brain and lower extremity vessels, the flow in most involved vascular regions. High concentrations of the drug after intravenous administration of 4 mg of sermion (nicergoline) result in a rise of the sympathetic vascular tone, high adrenoblocking action.
