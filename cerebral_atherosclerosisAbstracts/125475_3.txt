Factors which are known to be associated with cerebral atherosclerosis were evaluated in Nigerian Africans. Of 465 autopsied adult Nigerians, 62 (13%) had cerebral atherosclerosis. The frequency and severity of atherosclerosis among Nigerians with hypertension, particularly male subjects, were higher than in normotensives. Although there was a similar frequency of hypertension among autopsied Nigerian and Minnesota Caucasian populations, the severity and extent of atherosclerosis were greater in the Minnesota Caucasian populations, the severity and extent of atherosclerosis were greater in the Minnesota population. The relatively short duration of hypertension in the Nigerian before death might be an important factor which did not permit progressive development of cerebral atherosclerosis. Other factors which predisposed the Nigerian to increased frequency and severity of atherosclerosis included increased heart weight and diabetes mellitus. The relatively low frequency of cerebrovascular disease in the Nigerian may be explained on the basis of a low degree of cerebral atherosclerosis and relatively short duration of hypertension.
