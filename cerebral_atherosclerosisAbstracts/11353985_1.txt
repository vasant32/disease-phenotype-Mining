OBJECTIVES: To make a retrospective analysis of the synthesis of antibodies to the MOMPS and LPS antigens of Chlamydia pneumoniae in patients with occlusive disease of the peripheral arteries (ODPA) and multiple sclerosis (MS). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied 190 samples of plasma from patients included in the following groups: group 1:66 samples from 66 patients with ODPA; group 2:74 samples from 31 patients with MS (20 remittent-relapsing and 11 secondarily progressive), followed over time; and group 3:50 samples from persons acting as controls. In all cases determinations were made using ELISA, of the IgG anti-MOMP and the IgG and IgA anti-LPS. Comparison of the continuous variables was made using the Mann-Whitney U Test. Discrete variables were analysed using the exact bilateral Fisher Test. The Wilcoxon Test over ranges was used to compare the evolution of antibodies in the patients with MS. RESULTS: The percentage of positive results in groups 1 to 3 for anti-LPS IgG were: 24.6%, 18.9% and 20.8%, respectively, with no differences between patients and controls; nor were there any differences with IgA (29%, 29.7% and 25%, respectively). However differences were seen in the anti-MOMP IgG between patients and controls (group 1:80.3%, group 2:37.8% and group 3: 33.3%). In patients with MS the results of the evolution of the antibodies did not reflect a uniform tendency of the levels of the different antibodies. CONCLUSION: A higher level of IgG anti-MOMP was seen in ODPA and MS, although this did not occur with anti-LPS or IgA.
