Vascular cognitive impairment is an important cause of cognitive decline in the elderly. Ischemic lesions in the brain have an influence on the natural history of dementia. Vascular dementia can be caused by small-vessels disease (S-VaD) or by large-artery atherosclerosis with vascular lesions in strategic areas of the brain (M-VaD). In both cases changes in white matter are observed. In 60 patients with S-VaD and in 34 with M-VaD the presence of vascular and biochemical risk factors was evaluated and compared to age and sex matched 126 controls without dementia. Coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, hypertension and strokes were observed more frequently in both investigated groups. Of biochemical risk factors, hyperhomocysteinemia (associated with low levels of folic acid and vitamin B 12) and low HDL cholesterol levels were found in both forms of VaD.
