A dynamic electrocardiographic observation was conducted in 200 patients with cerebral stroke (57 patients had intracerebral haemorrhages, 143--ischaemic strokes). ECG changes  as a sequele of cerebral stroke were found to manifest themselves in various cardiac rhythm disorders, disturbances in the conductivity and repolarization phase. "Cerebrogenic" ECG changes were found in 76.5% of the patients. ECG changes were noted to occur in different combinations which permits to distinguish three main variants.
