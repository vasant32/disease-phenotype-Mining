External carotid artery, to a peripheral destination, becomes most important when it is a supplying artery. The work about 5 cases, followed up 2 to 21 months, confirms the importance of this artery, in its substitute function in case of internal carotid artery thrombosis. The problem is its functional future inside the atheriosclerosis evolutivity. All the patients had a revascularization of the stenotic external carotid artery. Therefore, we proposed revascularization indications of the stenotic supplied external carotid artery: --When a neurologic ischemic attack exists, from stenosis or ulcerative plaques, revascularization surgery of this artery is indicated like for internal carotid artery. --Asymptomatic significant stenosis or ulcerative plaque of supplied external carotid artery are indications for prophylactic surgery, knowing the evolutive risk and the insufficiency of the concerned hemispheric vascularization. --But, frequent controls are sufficient when the stenosis is not significant.
