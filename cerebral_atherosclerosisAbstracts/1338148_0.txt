The problem of the role of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) in the mechanism of symptom formation and in the pathogenesis of acute disturbances of cerebral circulation (ADCC) has not been studied well. Bearing this in mind, the authors examined 78 patients who suffered ADCC. The patients were divided into 2 groups. The first group was made up of 50 patients who suffered ischemic brain stroke with a stable neurological defect (SSD), the second one comprised 28 patients who suffered brain stroke with a reversible neurological defect (SRD). It has been established as a result that the initial level of sympatheticotonia and the intensity of the signs of vegetodystonia was higher in patients with SSD. Electrophysiological studies have demonstrated that in SRD, the level of ascending nonspecific brain activation prevailed according to the responsiveness of the reference alpha-rhythm as compared with the first group patients and the control group. The data obtained are discussed from the standpoint of the compensatory role played by the autonomic nervous system in the pathogenesis and course of the clinical forms of ADCC differing in the gravity and prognosis.
