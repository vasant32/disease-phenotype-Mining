Given the high burden of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in dialysis patients, we hypothesized that cognitive testing would reveal subtle abnormalities in subcortical brain function, a measure frequently associated with cerebrovascular disease. Detailed neurocognitive testing was performed in 25 hemodialysis patients. All patients had Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores >24 and had no history of cerebrovascular disease. Where appropriate, scores were normalized for age, gender, and education. One-sample t tests were used to compare differences in cognitive function between dialysis patients and normative data. The mean age was 57 years, and the mean MMSE was 27.5. Fourteen subjects (56%) were females, and 15 white (60%). Results of the North American Adult Reading Test, a measure of verbal intelligence, were comparable with the general population. Similarly, measures of cortical function, namely retention and recognition scores from the Word List Learning subtest of the Wechsler Memory Scale-III, were preserved when compared with normative data where reference = 10. Significant deficits were seen on tests assessing subcortical function: scores (mean+/-standard deviation) for block design, and symbol coding subtests of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III were 7.0+/-1.7 and 7.7+/-3.1, respectively (p<0.001 for both comparisons with normative data). Similarly, adjusted scores on the trails A and B tests were 40.5+/-8.3 and 41.8+/-11.3, respectively (p<0.001 for both comparisons with normative data where reference= 50). These results suggest that, despite relatively normal MMSE scores, mild cognitive impairment may be prevalent in hemodialysis patients. The pattern of cognitive dysfunction is primarily subcortical in nature.
