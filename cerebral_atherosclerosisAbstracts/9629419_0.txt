The authors describe a case of Binswanger's disease in a female patient with arterial hypertension followed during 10 years, before and after the demential syndrome. The clinical diagnosis was established through history, clinical and neurological examination, and neuropsychologic evaluation. Computed tomography and particularly magnetic resonance imaging suggested the diagnosis, that was confirmed by the anatomo-pathological study. They discuss behavioral and clinical data, and radiological and histopathologic aspects, comparing them with data found in the literature.
