Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is the most common cause of death in the United States. Investigation of atherosclerotic plaque morphology and composition is important because the findings may be useful in predicting prognosis or response to therapy. This study presents high-resolution magnetic resonance (MR) imaging techniques developed on a 1.5-T whole-body imager with a custom-built surface coil, for characterizing the composition and morphology of plaque removed at carotid endarterectomy. The initial comparison of MR imaging and histologic results showed good correlation. In conjunction with MR angiography, these techniques could be used in in vivo imaging to define the size, location, and contents of atherosclerotic plaque at the carotid bifurcation.
