OBJECTIVE To investigate the relationship between the Nco I, Ava II polymorphism of low density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R) gene in patients with the occurrence of atherosclerotic cerebral infarction (ACI) among the Han nationality in Liaoning province. METHODS The polymerase chain reaction technique was used to study the polymorphisms of LDL-R gene and allele frequencies in 77 patients with ACI and in 113 age-matched Chinese healthy controls. The levels of the lipid and lipoproteins were also compared among the cases with ACI and the controls. RESULTS A(+) frequencies of LDL-R gene in healthy controls and ACI group were 0.230 and 0.125 respectively, while the N(+) frequencies of healthy control and ACI group was 0.667 and 0.662 respectively. In case of the coexistence of A(-) A(-) and N(+) N(+), the relative risk (RR) of ACI was 5.56(P<0.001), while the RR of the increase of serum levels TG, TC, LDL-C, LP(a) were 4.29, 7.67, 9.33 and 3.09(P<0.05), respectively. CONCLUSION The coexistence of A(-) A(-) and N(+) N(+) can affect the concentration of lipid and lipoprotein and is in close relationship with the occurrence of ACI.
