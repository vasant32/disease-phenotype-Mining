72 patients at the age of 44 to 76 years with transitory ischaemic attacks which happened and for a short time reversible deficits, respectively, were diagnosed both conventionally duplex-sonographically and with the colour-coded duplex sonography under the question of vascular stenotic process in the region of the cervical vessels. After the ultrasound examination within two weeks an angiography was performed. As a result was shown that in 10 patients with an angiogram without pathological findings by means of the colour-coded duplex sonography in 3 cases plaque formations could be proved which could be clearly diagnosed only by colour marking.
