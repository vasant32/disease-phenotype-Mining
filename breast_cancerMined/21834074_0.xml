<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is unknown to what extent environmental factors modify the inherent genetic risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>If women from different countries, but with similar mutations, experience different levels of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> risk, nongenetic risk modifiers are likely to be present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Study subjects were a cohort of 1477 women with a BRCA1 mutation, from Canada (n = 358), the United States (n = 256) and Poland (n = 863) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The women were followed for a mean of 4.3 years and 130 incident cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Annual <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> incidence rates were calculated, and based on these, penetrance curves were constructed for women from North America and Poland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a Cox proportional hazards model, residence in Poland, versus North America, was associated with an adjusted hazard ratio of 0.54 (95% CI 0.34-0.86; p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> to age 70 was estimated to be 49% for women from Poland and 72% for women from North America </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among women with BRCA1 mutations, the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> in women who reside in Poland is less than that of women who reside in North America </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The reasons for the difference are unknown, but this observation suggests that environmental factors or genetic modifiers are important in determining risk </plain></SENT>
