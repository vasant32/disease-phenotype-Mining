<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: ESR1 was assessed in 1129 (81%) of 1396 postmenopausal Danish women with early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> randomly assigned to receive 5 years of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6413">letrozole</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="41774">tamoxifen</z:chebi> or a sequence of these agents in the Breast International Group 1-98 trial and who had ER ≥ 1% after central review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: By FISH, 13.6% of patients had an ESR1-to-Centromere-6 (CEN-6) ratio ≥ 2 (amplified), and 4.2% had ESR1-to-CEN-6 ratio &lt;0.8 (deleted) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Deletion of ESR1 was associated with significantly lower levels of ER (P &lt; 0.0001) and PgR (P = 0.02) and more frequent HER2 amplification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ESR1 deletion or amplification was associated with higher-Ki-67 than ESR1-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall, there was no evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of disease-free survival (DFS) or in treatment effect according to ESR1 status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, significant differences in DFS were observed for subsets based on a combination of ESR1 and HER2 status (P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: ESR1 aberrations were associated with HER2 status, Ki-67 labeling index and ER and PgR levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When combined with HER2, ESR1 may be prognostic but should not be used for <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> treatment selection in postmenopausal women with <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi>-responsive early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
