<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the prevalence of BRCA1/2 mutations in non-familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> patients with high risks in Korea </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A subset of 758 patients was selected for this study from the KOHBRA nationwide multicenter prospective cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mutations in BRCA1/2 genes were tested using fluorescent-conformation sensitive gel electrophoresis, denaturing high performance liquid chromatography or direct sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mutation of BRCA1/2 genes were identified in 65 (8.6%) patients among total 758 patients [BRCA1 mutation: 25 (3.3%), BRCA2 mutation: 40 (5.3%)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>According to risk groups, mutation of BRCA1/2 genes were identified in 53 (8.5%) of 625 early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> patients (age ≤ 40), in 22 (17.7%) of 124 bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> patients, in 3 (50.0%) of 6 breast and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1140680" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">ovarian cancer</z:e> patients, in one (5.9%) of 17 male <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> patients, in 5 cases (7.6%) of 66 multiple organ <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most common mutation was 509C&gt;A for BRCA1 and 7708C&gt;T for BRCA2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of BRCA1/2 mutations by age in early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> patients was significantly different (age &lt;35 vs age ≥35; 10.0 vs 2.9%, p = 0.0007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>BRCA1/2 mutations for non-familial Korean <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> patients were detected at a high rate, particularly, in patients with early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of less than 35 years of age, bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo>, and breast and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1140680" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">ovarian cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Individualized genetic counseling should be offered for non-familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> patients with these risk factors </plain></SENT>
