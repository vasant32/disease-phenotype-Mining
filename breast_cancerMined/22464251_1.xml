<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We performed a population-based case-control mutation-screening study that identified six probably pathogenic coding variants in 1,308 cases with early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> and no variants in 1,120 controls (the severity grading was p &lt; 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also performed additional mutation screening in 689 multiple-case families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We identified ten <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast-cancer</z:hpo>-affected families with protein-truncating or probably deleterious rare missense variants in XRCC2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our identification of XRCC2 as a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> susceptibility gene thus increases the proportion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancers</z:hpo> that are associated with homologous recombination-DNA-repair dysfunction and Fanconi <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> and could therefore benefit from specific targeted treatments such as PARP (poly <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="33942">ribose</z:chebi> polymerase) inhibitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates the power of massively parallel sequencing for discovering susceptibility genes for common, complex diseases </plain></SENT>
