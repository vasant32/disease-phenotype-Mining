<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Improved <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> survival poses important questions about future life conditions of the survivor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the possible influence of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> diagnosis on subsequent working and marital status, sickness absence and income </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS: We conducted a matched cohort study including 4,761 women 40-59 years of age and registered with primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> in a Swedish population-based clinical register during 1993-2003, and 2,3805 women without <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Information on socioeconomic standing was obtained from a social database 1 year prior and 3 and 5 years following the diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In Conditional Poisson Regression models, risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated to assess the impact of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: Three years after diagnosis, women who had had <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> more often had received sickness benefits (RR = 1.49, 95% CI 1.40-1.58) or disability pension (RR = 1.47, 95% CI 1.37-1.58) than had women without <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found no effect on income (RR = 0.99), welfare payments (RR = 0.98), or marital status (RR = 1.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A higher use of sickness benefits and disability pension was evident in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> stages of the disease, although the difference in use of sickness benefits decreased after 5 years, whereas the difference in disability pension increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For woman with early stage <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo>, the sickness absence was higher following diagnosis among those with low education, who had undergone mastectomy, and had received chemo- or hormonal therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Neither <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> size nor presence of lymph nodes <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> was associated with sickness absence after adjustment for treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: Even in early stage <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo>, a diagnosis negatively influences working capacity both 3 and 5 years after diagnosis, and it seems that the type of treatment received had the largest impact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A greater focus needs to be put on rehabilitation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> patients, work-place adaptations and research on long-term sequelae of treatment </plain></SENT>
