<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a cohort study of women with a BRCA1 (n = 1523), or BRCA2 mutation (n = 369) who had not been diagnosed with breast or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1140680" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">ovarian cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For each woman, the pedigree was reviewed and the origin of the mutation was assigned as probable paternal or maternal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The hazard ratio for developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> in the follow-up period was estimated for women with a paternal mutation, compared to a maternal mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> was modestly higher in women with a paternal BRCA1 mutation, compared to women with a maternal BRCA1 mutation (HR = 1.46; 95% CI 0.99 to 2.16) but the difference was not significant (p = 0.06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The parental mutation origin did not affect the risk in women with a BRCA2 mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that there is an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> among women with a paternally-inherited BRCA1 mutation, compared to a maternally-inherited mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the data are not sufficiently compelling to justify different screening recommendations for the two subgroups </plain></SENT>
