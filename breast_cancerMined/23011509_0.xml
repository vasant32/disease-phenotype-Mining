<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Several common germline variants identified through genome-wide association studies of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> risk in the general population have recently been shown to be associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> risk for BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 mutation carriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>When combined, these variants can identify marked differences in the absolute risk of developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> for mutation carriers, suggesting that additional modifier loci may further enhance individual risk assessment for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, a common variant on 6p22 (rs9393597) was found to be associated with increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> risk for BRCA2 mutation carriers [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.55, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.25-1.92, p = 6.0 × 10(-5)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This observation was based on data from GWAS studies in which, despite statistical correction for multiple comparisons, the possibility of false discovery remains a concern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here, we report on an analysis of this variant in an additional 6,165 BRCA1 and 3,900 BRCA2 mutation carriers from the Consortium of Investigators of Modifiers of BRCA1/2 (CIMBA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this replication analysis, rs9393597 was not associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> risk for BRCA2 mutation carriers (HR = 1.09, 95 % CI 0.96-1.24, p = 0.18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No association with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1140680" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">ovarian cancer</z:e> risk for BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation carriers or with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> risk for BRCA1 mutation carriers was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This follow-up study suggests that, contrary to our initial report, this variant is not associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> risk among individuals with germline BRCA2 mutations </plain></SENT>
