<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean age at diagnosis for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> was 33 years </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pathologic stage was I or II, and immunohistochemistry showed negative immunoreactivity for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> receptor and Her-2/neu in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three patients had familial history of breast, ovarian or other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One patient who was diagnosed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> at the age of 26 had two maternal family members of metachronous bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumors</z:e> were early stage, high grade, and almost triple-negative phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> familial history of breast, ovary or other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> was maternal </plain></SENT>
