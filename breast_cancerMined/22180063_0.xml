<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy has replaced axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) as the standard axillary staging procedure in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Follow-up studies in SLN-negative women treated without ALND report low rates of axillary recurrence, but most studies have short follow-up, and few are multicentre studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between September 2000 and January 2004, patients who were SLN-negative and did not have ALND were included in a prospective cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier estimates were used to analyse the rates of axillary recurrence and survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The risk of axillary recurrence was also compared in centres with high and low experience with the SLN biopsy (SLNB) technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 2195 patients with 2216 breast <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> were followed for a median of 65 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Isolated axillary recurrence was diagnosed in 1·0 per cent of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The event-free 5-year survival rate was 88·8 per cent and the overall 5-year survival rate 93·1 per cent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in recurrence rates between centres contributing fewer than 150 SLNB procedures to the cohort and centres contributing 150 or more procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study confirmed the low risk of axillary recurrence 5 years after SLNB for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> without ALND </plain></SENT>
