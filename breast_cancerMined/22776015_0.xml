<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Consecutive <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> MDT decisions, subsequent decision implementation, and reasons for nonimplementation were prospectively recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Factors associated with nonimplementation of the MDT decision were analyzed with logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of 289 consecutive MDT decisions involving 210 women, 20 (6.9%, 95% CIs 4.3%-10.5%) were not implemented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most changed MDT decisions did so because of patient preferences (n = 13, 65%), with the discovery of new clinical information (n = 3) and individual doctor's views (n = 4) also leading to decision nonimplementation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MDT decisions were significantly less likely to be adhered to in patients with confirmed malignant disease compared to those with benign or 'unknown' disease categories (p &lt; 0.001) and MDT decisions in older patients were significantly more likely not to be implemented than in younger patients (p = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Auditing nonimplementation of MDT recommendations and examining reasons for changed decisions is a useful process to monitor team performance and to identify factors that need more attention during the MDT meeting to ensure that the process makes optimal patient centered decisions </plain></SENT>
