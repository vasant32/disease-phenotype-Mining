<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cut-off for young age differed between studies and it is unclear whether the survival-age relationship is a linear function across age in premenopausal women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analyzed data on 9,885 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> patients aged &lt;or=50 years who entered the Korean <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>Breast Cancer</z:hpo> Society Registration Program between 1992 and 2001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Overall survival data were compared among age groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up duration was 74.4 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, 351 were aged &lt;30 years (Group I), 1,092 were aged 30-34 years (Group II), 2,087 were aged 35-39 years (Group III), and 6,354 were aged 40-50 years (Group IV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In univariate and multivariate analyses, Group I patients showed a worse outcome than Group II patients, and Group II patients showed a worse outcome than Group III patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the survival rates of Group III and Group IV patients did not differ significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This survival trend according to age group was not found in the subgroup of patients with hormone receptor-negative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In patients aged &lt;35 years, the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rose by 5% for every 1-year reduction in age, whereas there was no significant change in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> risk with age in patients aged 35-50 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We show that risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> increases sharply in women younger than 35 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This suggests that age less than 35 years is a reasonable cut-off for defining young age-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
