<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two subpopulations of apparently postmenopausal women might derive reduced benefit from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6413">letrozole</z:chebi> due to residual or returning ovarian activity: younger women (who have the potential for residual subclinical ovarian <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> production), and those with chemotherapy-induced menopause who may experience return of ovarian function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In these situations <z:chebi fb="3" ids="41774">tamoxifen</z:chebi> may be preferable to an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50790">aromatase inhibitor</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among 4,922 patients allocated to the monotherapy arms (5 years of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6413">letrozole</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="3" ids="41774">tamoxifen</z:chebi>) in the BIG 1-98 trial we identified two relevant subpopulations: patients with potential residual ovarian function, defined as having natural menopause, treated without adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy and age ≤ 55 years (n = 641); and those with chemotherapy-induced menopause (n = 105) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neither of the subpopulations examined showed treatment effects differing from the trial population as a whole (interaction P values are 0.23 and 0.62, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Indeed, both among the 641 patients aged ≤ 55 years with natural menopause and no chemotherapy (HR 0.77 [0.51, 1.16]) and among the 105 patients with chemotherapy-induced menopause (HR 0.51 [0.19, 1.39]), the disease-free survival (DFS) point estimate favoring <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6413">letrozole</z:chebi> was marginally more beneficial than in the trial as a whole (HR 0.84 [0.74, 0.95]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Contrary to our initial concern, DFS results for young postmenopausal patients who did not receive chemotherapy and patients with chemotherapy-induced menopause parallel the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6413">letrozole</z:chebi> benefit seen in the BIG 1-98 population as a whole </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data support the use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6413">letrozole</z:chebi> even in such patients </plain></SENT>
