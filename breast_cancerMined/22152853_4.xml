<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Moderate differences in efficacy between adjuvant chemotherapy regimens for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> are plausible, and could affect treatment choices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought any such differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We undertook individual-patient-data meta-analyses of the randomised trials comparing: any <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36064">taxane</z:chebi>-plus-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracycline</z:chebi>-based regimen versus the same, or more, non-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="36064">taxane</z:chebi> chemotherapy (n=44,000); one <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracycline</z:chebi>-based regimen versus another (n=7000) or versus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi>, and fluorouracil (CMF; n=18,000); and polychemotherapy versus no chemotherapy (n=32,000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The scheduled dosages of these three drugs and of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracyclines</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28748">doxorubicin</z:chebi> (A) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47898">epirubicin</z:chebi> (E) were used to define standard CMF, standard 4AC, and CAF and CEF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Log-rank <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> mortality rate ratios (RRs) are reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: In trials adding four separate cycles of a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36064">taxane</z:chebi> to a fixed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracycline</z:chebi>-based control regimen, extending treatment duration, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> mortality was reduced (RR 0·86, SE 0·04, two-sided significance [2p]=0·0005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In trials with four such extra cycles of a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36064">taxane</z:chebi> counterbalanced in controls by extra cycles of other cytotoxic drugs, roughly doubling non-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="36064">taxane</z:chebi> dosage, there was no significant difference (RR 0·94, SE 0·06, 2p=0·33) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Trials with CMF-treated controls showed that standard 4AC and standard CMF were equivalent (RR 0·98, SE 0·05, 2p=0·67), but that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracycline</z:chebi>-based regimens with substantially higher cumulative dosage than standard 4AC (eg, CAF or CEF) were superior to standard CMF (RR 0·78, SE 0·06, 2p=0·0004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Trials versus no chemotherapy also suggested greater mortality reductions with CAF (RR 0·64, SE 0·09, 2p&lt;0·0001) than with standard 4AC (RR 0·78, SE 0·09, 2p=0·01) or standard CMF (RR 0·76, SE 0·05, 2p&lt;0·0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> meta-analyses involving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36064">taxane</z:chebi>-based or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracycline</z:chebi>-based regimens, proportional risk reductions were little affected by age, nodal status, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> diameter or differentiation (moderate or poor; few were well differentiated), <z:chebi fb="67" ids="50114">oestrogen</z:chebi> receptor status, or <z:chebi fb="3" ids="41774">tamoxifen</z:chebi> use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Hence, largely independently of age (up to at least 70 years) or the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> characteristics currently available to us for the patients selected to be in these trials, some <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36064">taxane</z:chebi>-plus-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracycline</z:chebi>-based or higher-cumulative-dosage <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracycline</z:chebi>-based regimens (not requiring stem cells) reduced <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> mortality by, on average, about one-third </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>10-year overall mortality differences paralleled <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> mortality differences, despite <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36064">taxane</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48120">anthracycline</z:chebi>, and other toxicities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: 10-year gains from a one-third <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> mortality reduction depend on absolute risks without chemotherapy (which, for <z:chebi fb="67" ids="50114">oestrogen</z:chebi>-receptor-positive disease, are the risks remaining with appropriate <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> therapy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Low absolute risk implies low absolute benefit, but information was lacking about <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> gene expression markers or quantitative immunohistochemistry that might help to predict risk, chemosensitivity, or both </plain></SENT>
