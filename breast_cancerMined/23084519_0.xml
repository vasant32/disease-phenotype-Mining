<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Menarche and menopause mark the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and cessation, respectively, of ovarian activity associated with reproduction, and affect <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to assess the strengths of their effects and determine whether they depend on characteristics of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> or the affected women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Individual data from 117 epidemiological studies, including 118 964 women with invasive <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> and 306 091 without the disease, none of whom had used menopausal hormone therapy, were included in the analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We calculated adjusted relative risks (RRs) associated with menarche and menopause for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> overall, and by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumour</z:e> histology and by <z:chebi fb="67" ids="50114">oestrogen</z:chebi> receptor expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>Breast cancer</z:hpo> risk increased by a factor of 1·050 (95% CI 1·044-1·057; p&lt;0·0001) for every year younger at menarche, and independently by a smaller amount (1·029, 1·025-1·032; p&lt;0·0001), for every year older at menopause </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Premenopausal women had a greater risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> than postmenopausal women of an identical age (RR at age 45-54 years 1·43, 1·33-1·52, p&lt;0·001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three of these associations were attenuated by increasing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adiposity</z:e> among postmenopausal women, but did not vary materially by women's year of birth, ethnic origin, childbearing history, smoking, alcohol consumption, or hormonal contraceptive use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three associations were stronger for lobular than for ductal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> (p&lt;0·006 for each comparison) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The effect of menopause in women of an identical age and trends by age at menopause were stronger for <z:chebi fb="67" ids="50114">oestrogen</z:chebi> receptor-positive disease than for <z:chebi fb="67" ids="50114">oestrogen</z:chebi> receptor-negative disease (p&lt;0·01 for both comparisons) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: The effects of menarche and menopause on <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> risk might not be acting merely by lengthening women's total number of reproductive years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Endogenous ovarian hormones are more relevant for <z:chebi fb="67" ids="50114">oestrogen</z:chebi> receptor-positive disease than for <z:chebi fb="67" ids="50114">oestrogen</z:chebi> receptor-negative disease and for lobular than for ductal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumours</z:e> </plain></SENT>
