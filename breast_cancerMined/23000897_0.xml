<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our ability to integrate information across platforms provided key insights into previously defined gene expression subtypes and demonstrated the existence of four main <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> classes when combining data from five platforms, each of which shows significant molecular <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>Somatic mutations</z:hpo> in only three genes (TP53, PIK3CA and GATA3) occurred at &gt;10% incidence across <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancers</z:hpo>; however, there were numerous subtype-associated and novel gene mutations including the enrichment of specific mutations in GATA3, PIK3CA and MAP3K1 with the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> A subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We identified two novel protein-expression-defined subgroups, possibly produced by stromal/microenvironmental elements, and integrated analyses identified specific signalling pathways dominant in each molecular subtype including a HER2/phosphorylated HER2/EGFR/phosphorylated EGFR signature within the HER2-enriched expression subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Comparison of basal-like <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1458155" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">breast tumours</z:e> with high-grade serous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0919267" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">ovarian tumours</z:e> showed many molecular commonalities, indicating a related aetiology and similar therapeutic opportunities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The biological finding of the four main <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> subtypes caused by different subsets of genetic and epigenetic abnormalities raises the hypothesis that much of the clinically observable plasticity and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> occurs within, and not across, these major biological subtypes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
