<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the accuracy of these models in Koreans is not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was performed to evaluate the accuracy of the BRCAPRO and Myriad II models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two hundred thirty-six women with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> who underwent comprehensive BRCA1/2 genetic testing at our hospital between 2003 and 2010 were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the performance of each model by comparing the numbers of observed versus predicted mutation carriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We calculated sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values at 10 % estimated probability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Forty-six individuals were identified to carry a deleterious BRCA mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of BRCA mutation (19.5 %) was significantly higher than that predicted by BRCAPRO (9.0 %, p = 0.001) and Myriad (5.6 %, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> patients, BRCA mutation rate (observed 22.7 %) was underestimated by both BRCAPRO (expected 11.4 %, p = 0.006) and Myriad II (expected 6.4 %, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Subgroup analyses showed that both models underestimated the risk of BRCA mutation in patients with a family history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> (probands' age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> diagnosis &gt;50 years), with only one relative with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo>, and with non-familial early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> or bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Using a 10 % cut-off, the sensitivities were 47.8 % (BRCAPRO) and 50.0 % (Myriad), and positive predictive values were 44.9 % (BRCAPRO) and 43.4 % (Myriad) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Both BRCAPRO and Myriad II underestimated the risk of BRCA1/2 mutation in Koreans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that these models are less sensitive in Korean women, and therefore a new BRCA mutation prediction model based on Korean data is needed for proper genetic counseling </plain></SENT>
