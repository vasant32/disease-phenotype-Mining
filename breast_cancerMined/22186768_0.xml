<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>False positives lead to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo>, unnecessary biopsies, and higher costs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Examine whether availability of on-site breast ultrasound or biopsy services, academic medical center affiliation, or profit status explains differences in false-positive rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: We examined 78,733 diagnostic mammograms performed to evaluate breast problems at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>Breast Cancer</z:hpo> Surveillance Consortium facilities from 1999 to 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We used logistic-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mixed effects regression to determine if adjusting for facility characteristics accounts for observed differences in false-positive rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MEASURES: Facilities were characterized as serving vulnerable women based on the proportion of mammograms performed on racial/ethnic minorities, women with lower educational attainment, limited household income, or rural residence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Although the availability of on-site ultrasound and biopsy services was associated with greater odds of a false positive in most models [odds ratios (OR) ranging from 1.24 to 1.88; P&lt;0.05], adjustment for these services did not attenuate the association between vulnerability and false-positive rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Estimated ORs for the effect of vulnerability indexes on false-positive rates unadjusted for facility services were: lower educational attainment [OR 1.33; 95% confidence intervals (CI), 1.03-1.74]; racial/ethnic minority status (OR 1.33; 95% CI, 0.98-1.80); rural residence (OR 1.56; 95% CI, 1.26-1.92); limited household income (OR 1.38; 95% CI, 1.10-1.73) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After adjustment, estimates remained relatively unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: On-site diagnostic service availability may contribute to unnecessary biopsies, but does not explain the higher diagnostic mammography false-positive rates at facilities serving vulnerable women </plain></SENT>
