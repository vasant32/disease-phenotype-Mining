<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Because the efficacy of mammography screening had been shown in randomized controlled trials, the focus has turned on its effectiveness within the daily practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using individual data of women invited to screening, we conducted a case-control study to assess the effectiveness of the Dutch population-based program of mammography screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cases were women who died from <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> between 1995 and 2003 and were closely matched to five controls on year of birth, year of first invitation, and number of invitations before case's diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ORs and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the association between attending either of three screening examinations prior to diagnosis and the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were calculated using conditional logistic regression and corrected for self-selection bias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We included 755 cases and 3,739 matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among the cases, 29.8% was screen-detected, 34.3% interval-detected, and 35.9% never-screened </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>About 29.5% of the never-screened cases had stage IV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> compared with 5.3% of the screen-detected and 15.1% of the interval-detected cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The OR (95% CIs), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ages (49-75 years), was 0.51 (0.40-0.66) and for the age groups 50-69, 50-75, and 70-75 years were 0.61 (0.47-0.79), 0.52 (CI 0.41-0.67), and 0.16 (0.09-0.29), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The study provides evidence for a beneficial effect of early detection by mammography screening in reducing the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> among women invited to and who attended the screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>IMPACT: This is the first case-control study that accurately accounts for equal screening opportunity for both cases and matched controls by number of invitations before case's diagnosis </plain></SENT>
