<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Five percent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> have distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e> at initial presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because metastatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> is considered to be an incurable disease, it is generally treated with a palliative intent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recent non-randomized studies have demonstrated that (complete) resection of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> is associated with a significant improvement of the survival of patients with primary metastatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, other studies have suggested that the claimed survival benefit by surgery may be caused by selection bias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, a randomized controlled trial will be performed to assess whether breast surgery in patients with primary distant metastatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> will improve the prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Randomization will take place after the diagnosis of primary distant metastatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients will either be randomized to up front surgery of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1458155" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">breast tumor</z:e> followed by systemic therapy or to systemic therapy, followed by delayed local treatment of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1458155" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">breast tumor</z:e> if clinically indicated.Patients with primary distant metastatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo>, with no prior treatment of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo>, who are 18 years or older and fit enough to undergo surgery and systemic therapy are eligible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Important exclusion criteria are: prior invasive <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo>, surgical treatment or radiotherapy of this <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1458155" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">breast tumor</z:e> before randomization, irresectable T4 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> and synchronous bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint is 2-year survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Quality of life and local <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> control are among the secondary endpoints.Based on the results of prior research it was calculated that 258 patients are needed in each treatment arm, assuming a power of 80% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Total accrual time is expected to take 60 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>An interim analysis will be performed to assess any clinically significant safety concerns and to determine whether there is evidence that up front surgery is clinically or statistically inferior to systemic therapy with respect to the primary endpoint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: The SUBMIT study is a randomized controlled trial that will provide evidence on whether or not surgery of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic disease</z:e> at initial presentation results in an improved survival </plain></SENT>
