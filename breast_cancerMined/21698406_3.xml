<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A growing number of young <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> survivors consider reproductive health issues, including subsequent fertility and pregnancy, of great importance, but many questions regarding safety remain unanswered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We conducted a comprehensive literature search and review of published articles, control-matched, population-based, and co-operative group reports that addressed various aspects of pregnancy after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> (patients' expectations, fertility damage, assessment and preservation, maternal and fetal outcome, breast feeding) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Overall, available data support pregnancy and breast feeding after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> as safe and feasible for women at low risk of recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This retrospective and population-based evidence is, however, frequently incomplete; usually not representative of the entire population, it can be biased by patients' related effects or underpowered and is often not controlled for biological factors and risk determinants in the statistical model used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Before making any definitive assumption on this delicate and fundamental aspect of a woman's life after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo>, we should demonstrate without any reasonable doubt that the scattered information available today is scientifically sound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Breast International Group and North American <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>Breast Cancer</z:hpo> Group are planning a global prospective study in young women with <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> responsive, early <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> who desire pregnancy, to assess both patients' and pregnancy outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The trial will include an observational phase investigating the feasibility and impact of a temporary treatment interruption to allow conception and an experimental phase investigating the optimal duration of the subsequent <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> treatment after delivery or the last failed attempt to get pregnant </plain></SENT>
