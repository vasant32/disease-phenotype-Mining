<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report a 18-year-old female patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000965'>livedo reticularis</z:hpo> and neurological disturbances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CT scan showed two big ischemic focuses in the pons, moreover MRI revealed small disseminated ischemic focuses in the pons and deep structures of both brain hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MRA demonstrated no changes in the big extracranial and intracranial arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Since the clinical data and neuroimaging results suggested <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282492" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sneddon's syndrome</z:e>, the skin and skeletal muscle biopsy was taken to examine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The immunohistochemical and ultrastructural investigations of the skin biopsy revealed a significant reduction of the lumen of the capillaries and small to medium-sized arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cells surrounding the vascular lumen, frequently with multilayer arrangement and their nuclei placed perpendicularly to the lumen, were CD31, CD34, and sporadically SMA positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At the ultrastructural level, these proliferating cells showed typical features of endothelial cells: abundant intermediate filaments and Weibel-Palade bodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Between the endothelial cells some junctions were detached as well in the capillaries as in the small arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The smooth muscle cells of the small arteries were electron denser than usual and their cytoplasmic protrusions penetrated to the endothelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The ultrastructural picture of some vessels with a considerably narrow lumen was typical of vessels newly formed during <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Neuroimaging including TC, MRI, MRA besides histological, immunohistochemical and ultrastructural evaluation may be useful for diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282492" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sneddon's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
