<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report the case of a patient who had 2 rare diseases, annular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023647" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">atrophic lichen planus</z:e> (AALP) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282492" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sneddon's syndrome</z:e> (SNS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This patient had also digital nodules with histological abnormalities suggestive of SNS vasculopathy, which have not been reported so far </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AALP is the most rare of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> varieties of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023646" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lichen planus</z:e> since this case is the third reported to date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The association of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085642" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">livedo racemosa</z:e> and cerebrovascular disease is the hallmark of SNS, the incidence of which is estimated to be 4 cases per year per million inhabitants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In both diseases, an abnormal production of elastic-tissue-degrading enzymes or a constitutional abnormality of the elastic tissue can be postulated, since SNS is characterized by arteriolar changes with deterioration of the internal elastic lamina and AALP by destruction of the dermal elastic tissue </plain></SENT>
