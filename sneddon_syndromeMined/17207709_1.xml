<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patient and her father were diagnosed with a primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibody</z:hpo> syndrome and were HLA-A30-B13-Bw6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, a HLA-Bw6-DQ1 association was present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the members of this kindred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that the combination of the histocompatibility class I and II antigens in this family may be a marker for predisposition to SS </plain></SENT>
