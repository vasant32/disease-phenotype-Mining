<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> and increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">von Willebrand</z:e> factor antigen were found in the sera of two cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Especially the data demonstrating small circulating immune complex as suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282492" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sneddon's syndrome</z:e>, a rare <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo> disorder, might immunologically be characterized by circulating IgM-containing immune complexes which, in addition, could play a role in the pathogenesis of this disease entity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The elevated <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> as well as the increased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">von Willebrand</z:e> factor antigen in the sera of the investigated patients have to be considered as nonspecific <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo>-associated phenomena </plain></SENT>
