<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The main objective of this study was to compare clinical and laboratory data obtained from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409980" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (PAPS) with and without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282492" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sneddon's syndrome</z:e> (SS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A transverse study with 54 (85.2% female) PAPS patients (Sapporo criteria) was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Demographic, drug use, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> data were evaluated, as well as clinical and laboratory findings of SS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were subdivided into one of two groups: PAPS with SS and PAPS without SS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both groups were similar with respect to age (p = 0.05), gender (p = 0.34), race (p = 0.31), weight (p = 0.93), height (p = 0.27), and body mass index (p = 0.75); however, the SS group exhibited higher disease duration (96.0 ± 54.9 vs. 55.2 ± 52.0 months, p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By definition, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> PAPS with SS patients suffer from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, an arterial event; the frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> events (28.5 vs. 7.5%, p = 0.04), as well as of limb <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (100 vs. 30.0%, p &lt; 0.0001) was higher in this group than in the PAPS without SS group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, patients in the PAPS without SS group had more venous events, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep venous thrombosis</z:hpo>, than those in the PAPS with SS group (80.0 vs. 50.0%, p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, an understanding of the relationship between APS and SS is important in order to identify a subgroup for which more rigorous accompaniment and therapy may be necessary </plain></SENT>
