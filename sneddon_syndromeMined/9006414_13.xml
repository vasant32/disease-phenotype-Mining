<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To characterize the clinical, biological, and neuroradiological findings in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282492" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sneddon syndrome</z:e>; to correlate magnetic resonance imaging abnormalities with disability, presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and other vascular risk factors, presence of heart valvulopathy on echography, and titer of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo>; and to compare these findings in antiphospholipid-positive and antiphospholipid-negative patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective review of the records of 32 consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000965'>livedo reticularis</z:hpo> and neurological events, followed up in our institution between January 1991 and August 1995 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Twenty-six patients (20 women and 6 men) who had at least 1 cerebral ischemic arterial event associated with generalized and pathological <z:hpo ids='HP_0000965'>livedo reticularis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The age at the first cerebral ischemic event ranged from 22 to 58 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Motor deficit was the most frequent sign (found in 73% of cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Disability was found in 50%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>systemic hypertension</z:hpo> in 65%, heart valvulopathy in 61%, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> in 42% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients were classified in 6 groups according to magnetic resonance imaging findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No correlation was found between the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> or other vascular risk factors, valvulopathy, antiphospholipids, and magnetic resonance imaging abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference between antiphospholipid-positive and antiphospholipid-negative patients except for the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003493'>antinuclear antibodies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was a significant correlation between the extent of magnetic resonance imaging abnormalities and disability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The severity of the disease seems to be correlated with magnetic resonance imaging aspects, but not to the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging may help to understand the natural course of the cerebral involvement of the disease </plain></SENT>
