<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282492" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sneddon's syndrome</z:e> is characterized by the association of ischemic cerebrovascular events and widespread <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085642" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">livedo racemosa</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The pathophysiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282492" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sneddon's syndrome</z:e> remains elusive, but various prothrombotic abnormalities have been previously reported in this setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Low levels of protein Z, a downregulator of coagulation, have been recently linked to an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to investigate the levels of protein Z in a series of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282492" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sneddon's syndrome</z:e> patients without circulating <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> in comparison with an age- and sex-matched control population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-six patients and 78 healthy controls had determination of their protein Z blood levels by an enzyme-linked immunoassay test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients' thrombotic and vascular risk factors, including tobacco smoking, arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, oral contraceptive agents, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e>, factor V Leiden, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1610621" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">factor II mutation</z:e> were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Protein Z plasma levels were significantly lower in patients (mean 1.47 mg/L) than in controls (mean 1.93 mg/L) (P=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Prevalence of protein Z deficiency (level &lt;1 mg/L) was significantly higher (P=0.001) among patients (31%) than among controls (3.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Factor V Leiden and heavy smoking were observed in 4 and 7 patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282492" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sneddon's syndrome</z:e> could be viewed as the peculiar clinical expression of various and sometimes associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001928'>coagulation abnormalities</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Low levels of protein Z may account, at least partly, for the thrombotic events observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282492" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sneddon's syndrome</z:e> and shed a new light on its pathophysiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Clinical implications for protein Z deficiency in this setting deserve further investigations </plain></SENT>
