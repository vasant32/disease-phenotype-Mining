<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It occurs sporadically, but a few familial cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282492" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sneddon's Syndrome</z:e> (SS) have been reported, like these 3 cases that represent one of the largest number among siblings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied three male brothers, aged 28, 37 and 42 years, with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> (ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in 2 patients and cerebral haemorrhages in the third) and their sister with no <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients presented with long lasting <z:hpo ids='HP_0000965'>Livedo Reticularis</z:hpo>, extending beyond the lower limbs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Skin biopsy on the centre of the reticular pattern showed, only in the second patient, partial endothelium detachment in dermo-hypodermic blood vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The males also had accesses of Livedoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>Vasculitis</z:hpo> (LV), in which a skin biopsy showed obliteration of several upper dermal vessels with hialin <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> and a very scarce inflammatory infiltrate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Complementary studies, with an extensive investigation on pro-coagulation/pro-thrombotic features including <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo>, were repeatedly negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Their non-consanguineous parents were not affected, but among these kindred of 9 individuals, apart from the 4 patients reported above, LR and LV were present in two other brothers and also in an aunt and uncle, suggesting <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> pattern of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo>, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003829'>incomplete penetrance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The relationship between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282492" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sneddon's Syndrome</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>Antiphospholipid Antibody</z:hpo> Syndrome is controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The present cases, having repeatedly negative <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo>, support the classification of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282492" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sneddon's Syndrome</z:e> as an independent nosological entity </plain></SENT>
