<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>High serum concentration of pVCAM-1 registered in 62.6% of SS patients was associated with extracerebral thromboses, not with severity of cerebral vessel damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Lethal outcomes for 2 years of follow-up occurred more frequently in patients with a high basal level of pVCAM-1 than in patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, development of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_596'>pathological process</z:mpath> in SS is associated with elevated concentration of serum pVCAM-1 and may serve an additional laboratory indicator of developing extrabrain thrombotic disorders and marker of unfavourable prognosis </plain></SENT>
