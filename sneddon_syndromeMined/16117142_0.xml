<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite the presence of similar features related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">antiphospholipid syndrome</z:e> (APS)--cerebrovascular disturbances, livedo, fetal loss, peripheral <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, antibodies to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi>, etc--there were distinct differences between SS and SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In SS, no <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp> ("butterfly", discoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e>, photosensibilization) typical for SLE as well as sores of mucous oral cavity, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0162323" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">polyarthritis</z:e>, serosity, diagnostically significant titers of antinuclear factor and antibodies to DNA were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SS emerged with livedo (44%), cerebrovascular disturbances (24%) and systemic APS appearances (32%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SLE in 75% cases began with its classical symptoms and in 25% with systemic APS signs and never with livedo or cerebrovascular disturbances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For 10.5 +/- 8.0 years, no cases of SS were featured by typical SLE symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pathomorphological study indicated that SS and SLE were independent diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Their similarity was due to development of secondary APS, including cerebrovascular disturbances and livedo, in some patients with SLE </plain></SENT>
