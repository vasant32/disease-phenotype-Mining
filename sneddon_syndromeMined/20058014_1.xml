<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The method involved 49 patients (38 premenopausal females and 11 males) diagnosed with PAPS (according to the Sapporo criteria) and their demographic data, clinical data, medications used and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results of this study are as follows </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both the groups of patients were statistically similar regarding age, race, weight and body mass index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, males were significantly taller than females (172 ± 8.9 vs. 159.2 ± 6.2 cm, p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The duration of disease was similar for females and males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of pulmonary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> was higher in females than in males (34.2 vs. 0.0%, p = 0.024) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Regarding other PAPS manifestations (arterial events, venous events, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002625'>deep venous thrombosis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0006112'>angina</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accidents</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282492" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sneddon syndrome</z:e>), comorbidities (arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242339" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">dyslipidemia</z:e>), lifestyle (physical activity, previous smoking and current smoking) and the use of medications (current and previous use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi>, as well as the use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="3" ids="3638">chloroquine</z:chebi>), both groups were statistically similar (p &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>More females than males tested positive for IgM anticardiolipin antibodies (76.3 vs. 36.4%, p = 0.025) or for at least one of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003613'>antiphospholipid antibodies</z:hpo> tested (either IgM anticardiolipin or IgG anticardiolipin 84.2 vs. 45.5%, p = 0.016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, both groups were similar regarding the frequency of positivity for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> and isolated IgG anticardiolipin, as well as regarding mean levels of IgG and IgM anticardiolipin (p &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We concluded that, among PAPS patients, the frequency of pulmonary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> and of positivity for IgM anticardiolipin is higher in females than in males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our findings show that there are gender differences in PAPS, differences that might be related to alterations in sex hormones </plain></SENT>
