Authors studied 142 test persons aged between 54 and 86 years who were, expected for arteriosclerosis, free of any other disease. Severity of arteriosclerosis was assessed by funduscopy and the test persons divided into four groups: without of arteriosclerosis, mild and medium arteriosclerosis, respectively, and severe arteriosclerosis. The automatic measurement of reaction time was repeated in the majority after certain interval. Results of the two examinations have been compared. It has been found that delay of reaction time showed substantial relationship with the severity of cerebral arteriosclerosis and exceeded the relationship with age. Longitudinal examination gave evidence that during aging delay of reaction time showed an even speed, i.e. age does not influence speed of delay. Contrariwise regression was found to be essentially more rapid in the groups with severe arteriosclerosis with poor incipient values.
