Characteristics of the rheoencephalographic signs of the blood supply inadequacy are given and their importance for early diagnosing of various forms of cerebrovascular pathology, revealing latent forms of the latter, and determining collateral circulation paths, compensatory potentialities, and indications for angiographic examinations are discussed.
