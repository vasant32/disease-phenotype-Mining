BACKGROUND: The discrimination between the terms "vascular disease" and "vascular aging-vascular disease interaction" can be used for active health patrolling and disease prevention. Our aim was to set age standards for vascular ultrasound parameters usable in epidemiological studies. METHODS: Investigation was conducted on healthy volunteers (age range 25-75 years). The evaluated parameters were: intima-media thickness (IMT), diameter change and circumferential arterial stiffness (CAS), resistance (RI), pulsatility (PI) and A/B indexes on common carotid artery (CCA). Measurements were performed on Aloka 5500-SSD Prosound ultrasound platform in B and M modes by standard protocols. ANOVA statistics was used for evaluation. RESULTS: There were 104 women and 46 men, 20% were hypertensive (all values still within the normal range under medication), 24% were overweight and 13% were active smokers. Investigated vascular parameters were within the normal age. IMT values bilaterally, RI on the right CCA and interadventitial diameters and CAS on the right CCA were found dependent to age (p<0.05). PI, A/B index, luminal diameters were not found age dependant (p>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Ultrasound can be used to determine proper vascular age of individuals offering proposition of different strategies for reduction or retardation of clinical manifestation of cerebrovascular disease.
