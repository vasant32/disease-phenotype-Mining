Using Rivermead behavioural memory test, we examined 142 patients with cerebral arteriosclerosis. The results showed that the rate of anomalies of screening score in patients with cerebral arteriosclerosis were significantly higher than that of the control group (P < 0.01). The patients and control scores were significantly different (P < 0.05) in all items except the picture and face recognition. Comparing the screening score with brain CT scan, we found a relationship between brain damage and behavioural memory declination. Also, many persons of control group got low scores with behavioural memory test, suggesting that the Rivermead behavioural memory test be sensitive to memory declination. With its simplicity and sensitivity the Rivermead behavioural memory test may have some practical value in China.
