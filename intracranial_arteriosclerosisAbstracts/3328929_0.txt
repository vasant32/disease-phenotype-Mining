In a series of 84 patients with various stages of atherosclerotic circulatory encephalopathy (ADE) the authors studied the possibility of detecting by ultrasound double scanning (UDS) of occlusive lesions of the brachiocephalic arteries and compared the results with the findings provided by cerebral angiography (AG). In a study of 35 healthy subjects normal parameters of the spectrograms of the extracranial arteries were established. In 84 patients with ADE, ultrasound double scanning revealed stenoses and occlusions of the brachiocephalic arteries in 47 cases. They were confirmed by AG and were classified into five categories. Comparison of the data demonstrated that the diagnostic reliability of UDS versus AG was 95.9%. UDS makes it possible to diagnose accurately occlusive lesions of the brachiocephalic arteries in patients with ADE and to determine indications for AG and thus may be used for screening purposes.
