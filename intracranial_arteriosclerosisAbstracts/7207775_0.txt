Forty specimens of carotid plaque from 30 patients who had suffered cerebrovascular accidents and 10 asymptomatic control patients were examined by light and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The SEM revealed the finely detailed surface characteristics of the plaque including cell deposits, endothelial damage, and exposed subendothelium. X-ray energy spectrography scans revealed that 7 specimens had calcium deposits. Presurgical treatment with dipyridamole and aspirin inhibited or substantially reduced thrombus formation.
