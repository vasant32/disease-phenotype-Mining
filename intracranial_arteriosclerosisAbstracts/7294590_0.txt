A study was done of 31 episodes of transient loss of consciousness occurring at the onset of 557 cerebral ischaemic events selected on the basis of a well known mode of onset, excluding prolonged comas. The following conclusions can be drawn: Transient loss of consciousness is uncommon in ischaemic strokes (6.5 p. cent), occurring twice as often in cardiac emboli (13.2 p. cent) as in a atherothrombotic brain infarction (6.2 p. cent), and more often in carotid (8.4 p. cent) than in vertebro-basilar (5.7 p. cent) territory. The incidence is however similar in both territories (4.6 p. cent and 4.8 p. cent) when epilepsy is excluded. Epilepsy accounts for nearly half (3.8 p. 100) of all losses of consciousness in hemispheric strokes, but was encountered neither in lacunar strokes nor in transient ischaemic attacks (T.I.A.). Transient loss of consciousness is uncommon in basilar TIAs, and extremely rare in lacunar strokes (1.5 p. 100) and in carotid TIAs (0 p. 100). Presumed mechanisms and practical implications are discussed.
