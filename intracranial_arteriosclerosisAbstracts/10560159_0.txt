Intraoperative monitoring of cerebral ischemia during surgery on the brachiocephalic arteries is carried out by several methods: transcranial dopplerography, electroencephalography, recording of the somatosensory evoked potentials, puncture measurement of intravascular pressure, etc. However, not all these methods are sufficiently informative, reliable, and safe. One of the methods meeting these requirements is noninvasive cerebral oximetry. The study was carried out by the Invos-3100 device (Somanetics, USA). The method of cerebral oximetry is based on optic spectroscopy using infrared light in the 650-1100 nm waveband. Monitoring was carried out in 34 patients with involvement of the brachiocephalic arteries. The results persuasively prove high informative value and safety of the method.
