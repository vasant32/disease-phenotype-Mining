The composition of acidic glycosaminoglycans (AGAG) in normal and atherosclerotic human cerebral arteries was studied by enzymatic methods. The main cerebral trunk contained more AGAG than the distal branches. The content and relative proportion of heparan sulfates were greater in normal areas than in those affected, but the reverse was found for dermatan sulfate and chondroitin 6-sulfate. Quantitative changes in AGAG with severity of the disease were compared with those in water and lipid content.
