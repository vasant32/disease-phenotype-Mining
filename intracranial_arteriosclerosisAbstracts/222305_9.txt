Plasma lipid and lipoproteins levels were determined in a continuous series of 50 patients (36 males and 14 females), mean age around 50 years, with a clinical diagnosis of transient ischemic attacks (TIAs). TIA was defined as a sudden episode of focal cerebrovascular insufficiency, with complete resolution of the symptoms within 24 h. TIAs are considered an important prognostic symptom for ischemic cerebrovascular diseases, being manifest in approximately 45% of the patients later undergoing a complete stroke. Plasma total cholesterol levels did not differ in these patients, when compared with a similar series of patients of the same age and sex, free of cerebrovascular lesions. A slight elevation of mean triglyceride levels was detected in the patients of both sexes, as well as higher incidence of type IV hyperlipoproteinemia. The most significant finding, however, observed only in male TIA patients, was that of significantly reduced high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol levels. This reduction (-19.7% compared to the control group) is similar to that recently reported for patients with clear-cut ischemic cerebrovascular disease. The detection of decreased HDL-cholesterol levels in male TIA patients may be of considerable significance for a prognostic evaluation of this biochemical parameter.
