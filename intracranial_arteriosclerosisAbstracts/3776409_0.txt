The authors studied the parameters of the central and cerebral hemodynamics in 66 males aged 38-58 years who were treated at a health resort for initial manifestations of cerebral circulation insufficiency (CCI). A test with graded exercise (GE) revealed in all patients an increase in the total peripheral vascular resistance (TPVR) which was the greatest in cases of initial manifestations of CCI due to borderline arterial hypertension (AH). In the period of recovery and following the nitroglycerin test the TPVR returned to the initial level in patients with AH and vegetovascular dystonia whereas there was no such decrease in patients with initial cerebral atherosclerosis. Already at the 1st minute of the recovery period following GE patients with atherosclerosis (A) and essential hypertension (EH) presented a considerable increase in the arterial tone (AT) which remained stable even after 10 min of rest. These changes in AT indicated a decrease in the adaptational possibilities of the cerebral hemodynamics and simultaneously made it possible to differentiate them from vegetovascular dystonia when AT increased insignificantly only during the first min after GE and then rapidly returned to the initial level and diminished even more during the nitroglycerin test. The proposed method of comprehensive examination of parameters of the central and cerebral hemodynamics when combined with neuropsychological findings makes it possible not only to improve the diagnosis of diseases responsible for initial manifestations of CCI but also to considerably increase the objectivity of the assessment of the sanatorium treatment.
