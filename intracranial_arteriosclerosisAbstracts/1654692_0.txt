Altogether 110 patients with initial signs of brain blood supply failure associated with essential hypertension and atherosclerosis were examined for vegetative responses (background, direction, reactivity, activity maintenance). Non-pharmacological correction (acupuncture, physiotherapy and dietetic management) was performed. The results obtained were statistically processed with the use of a correlation analysis. Undue sympathetic direction, especially in essential hypertension patients, was disclosed. Acupuncture turned out to be an effective method for the treatment of the initial signs of brain blood supply failure associated with essential hypertension. In atherosclerosis, that pathology was more amenable by correction with multimodality treatment.
