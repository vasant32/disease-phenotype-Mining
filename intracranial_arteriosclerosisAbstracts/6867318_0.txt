After some introductory remarks on the definition of the various forms of hypertension, a short description of the changes in arterial vessels associated with hypertension is given. Hypertension is by no means a prerequisite for atherosclerosis and arteriolosclerosis, but hypertension enhances such vascular changes. In malignant hypertension, typical fibrinoid arteriolonecroses occur. Hypertension leads to hypertrophy of the left ventricle through enlargement of individual muscle fibres, but numeric hyperplasia also occurs. At the same time, coronary atherosclerosis may be aggravated by systemic hypertension. Hypertrophy together with coronary sclerosis may result in various forms of ischemic heart disease among which myocardial infarction and its complications are the most important ones. There are intimate mutual interactions between hypertension and ischemic renal damages, the most important of which are briefly discussed. Again, many of these changes do not necessarily require hypertension as a prerequisite. Massive haemorrhage into the substance of the brain is usually associated with systemic arterial hypertension, but requires predisposing atherosclerosis and arteriolosclerosis: Walls of healthy arteries do not give way, however high the blood pressure may be.
