Fifty-six elderly patients with depressive-delirious and hallucinatory disturbances, as well as with the syndrome of impaired consciousness were divided into three groups depending on the kind of treatment they received (hemosorption, hyperbaric oxygenation and psychotropic drugs). The treatment was evaluated using clinical and pathopsychological methods. The data obtained indicate a high efficacy of detoxicating methods as compared to psychotropic therapy. The reported reduction in triglyceride levels under the impact of hemosorption and hyperbaric oxygenation normalizes metabolic processes and indicates a reduced hypoxia of nerve cells.
