Percutaneous laser angioplasty was attempted in 30 patients with occlusive lesions of the main arteries of the lower extremities and the branches of the aortic arch. Most patients had either combined affection of the branches of the aortic arch and arteries of the lower extremities (56%), or involvement of several vascular segments on one extremity into the process (74%), or involvement of arteries of both lower extremities (85%). Seven patients underwent stage correction of circulatory cerebral disorders and restoration of patency of arteries of both lower extremities. Excimer laser on a wave length of 308 nm was used for angioplasty. Adequate operations were carried out in all cases without any complications in the postoperative period.
