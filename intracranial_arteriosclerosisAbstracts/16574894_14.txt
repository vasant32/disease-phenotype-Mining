OBJECTIVE: The development of a murine model of atherosclerotic plaque rupture. METHODS AND RESULTS: The left common carotid arteries of male apolipoprotein E (apoE)-deficient mice (9 weeks old) were ligated just proximal to their bifurcations. After 4 weeks on a standard diet, the mice received polyethylene cuff placement just proximal to the ligated site, and the animals were then processed for morphological studies at specific time points. Ligation of the carotid artery in apoE-deficient mice for 4 weeks induced marked intimal hyperplasia, which is a lipid- and collagen-rich lesion that contains a number of macrophages, T lymphocytes, and smooth muscle cells. Subsequently, the cuff placement evoked intraplaque hemorrhage and plaque rupture with fibrin(ogen)-positive luminal thrombus in this region accompanying a decrease in collagen content as well as an increase in apoptotic cells in the intima within a few days after cuff placement. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated the murine model of human plaque rupture, which is simple, fast, and highly efficient. This model would help us not only to understand the mechanism of human plaque rupture but also to assess various already-known and as-yet-unknown agents in the future.
