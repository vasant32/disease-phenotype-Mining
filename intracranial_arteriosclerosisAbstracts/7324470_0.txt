The determination of serum cholesterol, triglycerides and lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL, LDL and HDL) in 96 patients suffering from cerebral vascular disease showed that some parameters were significantly different from those recorded in a control population of corresponding age HDL values below 40 mg/dl were found in 50% of cases. Pathological LDH/HDL and VLDL/HDL ratios were found in 30.9% and 37.7%, respectively, of patients with cerebrovascular disease, whose serum cholesterol level was below 250 mg/dl and triglyceride level was 175 mg/dl. Only 56% of all patients had elevated serum cholesterol and/triglyceride and triglyceride alone does not detect the risk. The difference in the VLDL/HDL ratio in patients with cerebrovascular disease and that of the control population is highly significant. The HDL values and the VLDL/HDL ratio differ significantly, also. On average, the HDL levels in women are higher than those in men, but the decrease faster with increasing age. In both sexes a decrease in HDL level occurs between the age of 40 and 80. Low HDL levels and unfavourable LDL/HDL and VLDL/HDL quotients are important risk indicators for cerebrovascular disease.
