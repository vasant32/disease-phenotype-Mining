The possibilities of the use of electroencephalography for evaluating intellectual-mnemonic disorders in elderly patients with cerebral atherosclerosis have been studied. The study included 95 subjects aged 60 to 74 years with varying intensity of circulatory atherosclerotic encephalopathy (without brain stroke). The psychological tests were performed according to Wechsler's methods. To evaluate the EEG, visual and automatic spectral analyses were employed. The data obtained were analyzed by means of discriminant, correlation and regression methods. A certain relationship was found between the results of the psychological tests and the EEG readings. The method of automatic EEG analysis is proposed, which allows revealing intellectual disorders in patients suffering from cerebral atherosclerosis. Its comparability with the data obtained by means of visual EEG analysis is discussed.
