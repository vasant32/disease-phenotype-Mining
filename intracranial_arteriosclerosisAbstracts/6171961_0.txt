A combined therapy was given to 30 patients with the acute stage of ischemic stroke that had complicated the course of cerebral atherosclerosis. The therapy consisted in exfusion of 250 to 300 ml of blood with subsequent infusion of low-molecular dextrans and various medicines. The changes of the general hemodynamic parameters at various stages of the therapy were compared with respective data obtained from 30 patients suffering from cerebral atherosclerosis but without acute cerebral circulation disorders, as well as from 20 healthy subjects. The results obtained give one grounds to recommend the above treatment method for use at early periods of the disease irrespectively of the initial level of the arterial pressure, especially, for patients in a grave state with marked metabolic disorders.
