As many as 34 patients having stage II-III atherosclerotic dyscirculatory encephalopathy with coexisting ischemic heart disease in the presence of stenosing and occlusive lesions of major brain arteries were evaluated for effects pentoxiphyllin and corglycon on the clinical course of this medical condition as well as systemic and cerebral haemodynamics. In this series, 82.7 percent of patients derived benefit from a single intravenous infusion of pentoxiphyllin and corglycon and course treatment with these drug preparation that was evidenced by an improvement in the parameters of systemic and cerebral hemodynamics and regression of neurologic symptomatology. The results of the studies made permit recommending pentoxiphyllin in combination with corglycon for treatment of those DE patients with eukinetic and hypokinetic types systemic haemodynamics, whereas pentoxiphyllin alone--for those with hyperkinetic type of haemodynamics, taking into consideration its cardiodepressive effects.
