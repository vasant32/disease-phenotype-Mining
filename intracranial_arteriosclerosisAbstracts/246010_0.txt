Arteriosclerosis is the most common cause of basilar artery thrombosis. Rarely basilar occlusions are observed after cerebral concussion and hyperextension of the neck; occasionally they are founded in craniocervical dysplasia, arteritis and hypercoagulability of blood.--Clinical data and differential diagnostic aspects are demonstrated in 4 own cases and the present literature. Characteristics of clinical symptomatology are discussed with respect to the sites of predilection in distal and proximal part of basilar artery. Angiography examination is the most important diagnostic method and shows prognostic indications by demonstration of collaterals.--The treatment consists of inhibition of blood viscosity, reduction of perifocal edema and stabilization of blood-pressure.
