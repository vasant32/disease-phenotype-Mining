While cerebrovascular diseases (CVD) are very common in hemodialysis (HD) patients, the prevalence and risk factors of asymptomatic occlusive lesions (AOL) of cerebral arteries in HD patients have not yet been elucidated. We performed cerebral magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) on 123 HD patients without symptomatic cerebrovascular disease and on 52 control subjects. On the basis of these images, we investigated the prevalence and risk factors of AOL. Stenosis greater than 25% narrowing of the cerebral arteries was found in 27 HD patients. The prevalence of AOL of cerebral arteries in HD patients was significantly higher than in the control group [27 (22.0%) versus 4 patients (7.7%), chi.2=4.2, p=0.0411]. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that independent risk factors of AOL of cerebral arteries were uremic state, dyslipidemia, and age in all subjects and dyslipidemia and age in HD patients (R.2=0.162, p=0.0004; R.2 =0.138, p=0.0145, respectively). Our findings suggest that chronic renal failure maintained by hemodialysis increases the prevalence of AOL, and that age and dyslipidemia are also significantly associated with AOL in HD patients.
