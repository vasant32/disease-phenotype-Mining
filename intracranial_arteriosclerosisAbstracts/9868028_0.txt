The transcranial Doppler and psychological measurement methods were used to evaluate the effect of musical relaxation therapy on the cerebral arteriosclerosis. The results showed that the musical relaxation therapy could improve the cerebral blood flow (physiological), offset the Type A behavior and eliminate the emotional disturbance (psychological), and that its effect was better than that of the control patients. The mechanism of the effect may be related to the 1/f sound wave (physical), abdominal respiration with long expiration and involuntary inspiration (physiological) and the hinting effects of the inducing phrases (psychological).
