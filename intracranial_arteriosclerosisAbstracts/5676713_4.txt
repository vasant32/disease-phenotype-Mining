Cerebral angiographic findings in ischaemic stroke are described and discussed in detail. Though the Indian patients studied had altogether different social customs, living standards, and dietary habits from Western people, the relative incidence of various cerebral vascular lesions did not differ significantly. Irrespective of the poor nutritional status of the patients, thrombosis associated with atherosclerosis was chiefly responsible for a non-embolic cerebral infarction. Atherothrombosis in the young normotensive persons not showing any evidence of arteritis, diabetes mellitus, or hypercholesterolaemia was also identified.The grave risks involved in cerebral angiography in cases of acute stroke are re-emphasized.As to prognosis, the nutritional status, the type and territory of an ictal lesion, and the blood levels of sugar and cholesterol had no significant influence on the immediate survival-after a non-embolic cerebral infarction. However, a significantly greater number of deaths were encountered in the hypertensive patients. Female patients and patients with a large cerebral infarction had a poor prognosis.
