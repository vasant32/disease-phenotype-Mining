In 138 patients (87 males and 51 females) with hypertensive disease (90 cases) and atherosclerosis (48 cases) the authors studied the content of sulfur and its fractions in the blood and the level of excretion with urine in disturbances of cerebral circulation. In hypertensive disease and cerebral atherosclerosis, complicated by disturbances of cerebral circulation, there were quantitative changes in the level of sulfur-containing substances both in the blood serum and urine. Disorders in the sulfur metabolism indicate a drop of the autotoxic function in the liver, quite possibly related to the influence of pathological changes proceeding in the central nervous system.
