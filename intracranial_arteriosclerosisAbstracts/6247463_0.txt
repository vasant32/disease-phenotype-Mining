Urinary excretion of cAMP was closely monitored for several days in 74 patients with subarachnoid hemorrhages. A rise in urinary cAMP up to 45 microM/24h was observed (normal values being 1 to 5 microM/24h). Patients with associated metabolic disorders were excluded from this study. We have found a correlation between the severity of the clinical conditions, recovery from acute disorder and cAMP excretion, thus suggesting that an increase of urinary cAMP level is related to the extent and the evolution of the acute cerebral damage.
