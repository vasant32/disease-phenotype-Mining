To clarify the clinical features and mechanism of infarction in the posterior cerebral artery territory, we investigated 35 consecutive patients who presented with homonymous visual field defects and occipital infarction documented by computed tomography. Cerebral angiographic findings in 23 patients, and the clinical features of rare transient ischemic attacks and maximal deficit occurring at stroke onset, were consistent with embolism of the posterior cerebral artery. Visual field defects were the only neurological abnormality in 17 patients; the remainder had additional findings. Three patients had a major brainstem stroke. Stroke in the posterior cerebral artery territory was found in a heterogeneous group of patients, although embolism was the most common stroke mechanism. Several distinct patient groups were identified: cardiac source embolism (10 patients), vertebrobasilar atheroma with local embolism (6), migraine (5), systemic illness with presumed coagulopathy (3), and "unknown source embolism" after negative cardiac investigation (11 patients). During follow-up, 26 patients had no further neurological events (the majority on anticoagulation or antiplatelet treatment), 3 suffered new strokes, and 6 died.
