One hundred and twelve subcutaneous injections of concentrated heparin (25,000 IU/ml), half in sodium heparin and half in calciparine, both with an identical heparin cation, were given in doses varying from 0.2 ml to 0.5 ml by a single operator in a double-blind study to assess the comparative local tolerance of the two heparin salts. The occurrence of bruising at the point of injection, more frequent with sodium heparin than with Calciparine, proved to be the distinguishing factor. Overall after 48 hours, 31 hematomas were observed with the sodium salt versus 20 with calciparine. McNemar's test of comparing matched proportions confirms this result (p = 0.03) and, with the order of the two treatments taken into consideration, J.J. Gart's exact test gives p = 0.0101.
