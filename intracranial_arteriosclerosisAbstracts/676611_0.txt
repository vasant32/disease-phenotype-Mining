Using a neurological, psychiatric, experimental neuropsychological and REG study with the use of functional tests, the authors studied 66 patients with different stages of dyscirculatory encephalopathy and 20 normals of the same age (a control group). These patients demonstrated different degrees of disturbed intellectual and mnestic activities, a drop of attention and general activity, the speed of reactions, as well as different forms of expressed psychoorganic symptoms developing on the background of diffuse and eventually of microfocal neurological symptomatology. The REG data revealed relation between the stage of the disease on the one hand and the state of the vascular tone, elasticity of the vascular wall, level of arterial pessure and pulse blood repletion, the state of the venous outflow on the other. Changes of such parameters indicate to a prevalently functional character of these changes in the I stage and  partly in the II stages of dyscirculatory encephalopathy and mainly organic in its III stage.
