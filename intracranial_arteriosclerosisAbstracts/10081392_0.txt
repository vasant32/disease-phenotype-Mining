Diagnostic sensitivity was compared for two binaural methods of "sensitized" speech audiometry--alternating speech audiometry (ASA) and Dichotic. A total of 35 patients were examined having neurosensory hypoacusis resultant from cerebrovascular atherosclerosis and chronic insufficiency of cerebral circulation. ASA indicated defects of the central parts of the acoustic analyzer in 80% of the examinees. The results of the two methods were similar in 85.7% of the patients. The diotic and dichotic alternating speech tests can be used separately and in combination in diagnosis of central acoustic disturbances, of vascular genesis, in particular.
