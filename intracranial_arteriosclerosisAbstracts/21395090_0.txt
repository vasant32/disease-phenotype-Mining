The study included 148 patients with different combinations of multifocal atherosclerosis. The inclusion criteria were clinical manifestations of chronic cerebrovascular insufficiency concomitant with diseases of other arterial basins. The treatment strategies were chosen based on the results of examination by non-invasive methods for vascular visualization. Contrast agents were used only for curative purposes. The patients were divided into 2 groups depending on surgical strategy. Patients of group 1 underwent one-step reconstruction of several affected basins, those in group 2 step-by-step revascularization of different arterial basins with the use of X-ray endovascular interventions. The former approach was applied at the initial stage of the work. It creating a high risk of complications, the latter approach was preferred in the subsequent period. The incidence of complications in group 2 was 4.05% and the lethality rate 1.49%. These values were significantly higher in patients of group 1.
