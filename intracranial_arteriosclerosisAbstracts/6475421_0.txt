Using the alkaline phosphatase test, the authors studied the capillaries of 41 fields in clinically healthy people aged 22-64 years and animals (dogs, cats, rats) and also in individuals aged 45 to 64 years with mild atherosclerosis in the area of the median cerebral artery trunk. It has been established that unlike "normal" people, atherosclerotic patients of the respective age show an increase in the volume of deposited blood in the presence of a reduction of the working surface and the average indices of the activity of alkaline phosphatase leading to a considerable diminution (21.5-23.5%) in the intensity of metabolic processes.
