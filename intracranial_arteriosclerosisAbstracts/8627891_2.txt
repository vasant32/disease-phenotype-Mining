 PURPOSE: Patients with premature peripheral vascular disease may respond differently than their older counterparts. To determine the impact of early onset of atherosclerosis on outcome, we decided to compare a group of these patients with a group of patients with typical onset of atherosclerosis with regard to early complications, indications for intervention, site of disease at initial presentation (aortoiliac, infrainguinal, or cerebrovascular), and long-term outcomes (secondary revascularization, amputation, and death). METHOD: All patients younger than 50 years old requiring operative intervention between 1987 and 1992 were retrospectively compared with a group of patients greater than 60 years old, randomly selected from patients who underwent operation during the same time period. Patients were evaluated and compared for indications, risk factors, and early and late outcomes. RESULTS: Patients with early onset atherosclerosis at the aortoiliac or infrainguinal level had a higher late amputation rate (17% versus 3.9%, p = 0.02) and poorer overall outcome than their older cohorts. Patients with cerebrovascular disease in both cohorts had similarly good prognoses. CONCLUSION: Aortoiliac or infrainguinal disease diagnosed in patients less than 50 years of age portends a poorer outcome than does similar disease in an older patient population.
