Using B-mode ultrasonography, the frequency of carotid atherosclerosis was investigated prospectively in 50 patients on maintenance haemodialysis compared to healthy controls. The patients showed significantly more atheromatous plaques at the carotid bifurcation, as well in the internal and external carotid artery (chi-square-test, p less than 0.05). There was no statistical difference between normotensive patients on haemodialysis and the control group, but hypertensive patients showed statistically significant more plaques of the cervical vessels (chi-square-test, p less than 0.05). Therefore, atheromatous plaques in haemodialysis patients appear to be due to hypertension rather than to maintenance dialysis.
