We investigated age-related changes in the visibility of intracranial arteries on magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and the influence of risk factors for stroke. We studied 230 adult patients without specific neurological deficits. MRA was performed using the three-dimensional time-of-flight technique with a spoiled gradient-recalled acquisition sequence. We classified internal carotid artery (IC) and the horizontal (M1) and distal (beyond M2) middle cerebral segments into 4 grades. Linear regression revealed a significant negative relation between age and the quality of demonstration on MRA. For IC and M1, the score was significantly lower in subjects with risk factors than in those without. The distal MCA was poorly seen in patients without a history of hypertension or lacunar infarcts. A marked correlation was observed between visibility and age patients with no history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidaemia. We suggest that atherosclerotic change and decline in flow velocity with normal ageing are factors leading to decreased visibility on MRA.
