From March 1980 to March 1987, 217 consecutive patients underwent 252 carotid revascularisations with routine use of continuous EEG monitoring and selective use of an intraluminal shunt for symptomatic (70%) or asymptomatic (30%) internal carotid artery (ICA) atherosclerotic stenosis. All carotid endarterectomies were routinely performed with a patch graft angioplasty. None of the patients suffered permanent or transient neurological deficits in the immediate postoperative period and none of them died. There was an 0.8% stroke rate and 0.4% mortality rate in the early postoperative course. Neurological assessment, Doppler and Echo doppler sonography of both the operated and the contralateral ICA was performed every 6 months. One-hundred and twenty-one patients (142 carotid revascularisations) operated on up to December 31st 1985 were reassessed in July 1986. The mean follow-up time was 35 months (range: 6 months to 6 years). New neurological symptoms were present in 7.4% of the patients; 2.5% of patients developed a stroke and 8.9% showed progression of stenosis in the contralateral ICA. One patient had a common carotid artery stenosis 2 years after surgery. Re-stenosis of the ICA was found in two patients who underwent re-operation without difficulty. The late mortality was 21.4% (11.9% of the overall series). In only two patients (7.6%) was stroke the cause of death.
