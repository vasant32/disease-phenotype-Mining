Ischaemic stroke ranks among the most important causes of death and disability in developed countries. Abnormal lipid metabolism is among the several factors that have a role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. We hypothesize that the decreased resistance of low-density lipoproteins against oxidative stress is an independent risk factor for cerebral atherosclerosis and suggest testing this hypothesis by ultrasonographic evaluation of the carotid artery and correlating this finding to plasma values of compounds that play a role in lipid metabolism. By measuring the oxidative resistance of low-density of lipoprotein the risk for ischaemic stroke can be predicted.
