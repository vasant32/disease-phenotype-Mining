 OBJECTIVE: To observe the relationship between coronary and carotid/cerebral atherosclerotic stenosis. METHODS: Carotid/aortocranial angiography and coronary angiography were performed in 34 CAD patients complicated with symptomatic cerebral ischemia. Patients were divided into 3 subgroups according to the extent of arterial stenosis determined by angiography. There were 5 light, 4 moderate and 25 severe stenosis determined by coronary angiography and there were 6 light, 6 moderate and 24 severe stenosis determined by carotid/aortocranial angiography. RESULTS: The extent of coronary artery stenosis was parallel to the carotid artery or vertebral artery stenosis. Twenty-four patients out of 25 patients with severe coronary stenosis had severe cerebrovascular stenosis (P = 0.873). The coincident rate was as high as 92% for patients with moderate or severe cerebrovascular stenosis whose Califf risk scores of coronary artery were more than or equal to 2. The follow-up study showed the incidence of cardiovascular event and cerebrovascular event increased significantly in the patients with moderate to severe coronary and cerebral arteries stenosis and 3 patients with severe stenosis found in both coronary and cerebral arteries died during follow up. CONCLUSION: The incidence and severity of coronary artery stenosis is parallel with carotid artery or vertebral artery stenosis.
