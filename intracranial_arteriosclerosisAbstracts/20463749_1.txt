Hypertension is associated with an increased risk of cognitive decline, which is generally regarded as a consequence of advanced cerebral atherosclerosis. Many hypertensive patients, however, suffer from cognitive decline long before they have any signs of cerebrovascular disease. Therefore, this study examines direct effects of blood pressure on neurotransmitter status in the hippocampus, a vulnerable cerebral structure relevant for memory consolidation. Absolute glutamate concentration and N-acetylaspartate (NAA) concentration as an alternative marker of neuronal integrity were determined in the hippocampus and the cerebral cortex (anterior cingulate cortex; ACC) by 3-T proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy in 16 probands without any history of cerebrovascular disease. Memory function was tested by the auditory verbal learning test (AVLT) and the rivermead behavioural memory test (RBMT). Arterial stiffness was assessed by augmentation index (AI). Mean arterial pressure showed a significant negative age-adjusted correlation to absolute glutamate concentrations in the hippocampus (R=-0.655, P=0.011), but not in the ACC. There was no significant correlation of mean arterial pressure and NAA in either hippocampus or ACC. AI did not affect hippocampal glutamate. Moreover, there was a significant negative correlation between mean arterial pressure and AVLT (r=-0.558, P=0.025) and RBMT score (r=-0.555, P=0.026). There is an inverse relation between blood pressure and the concentration of hippocampal glutamate. Glutamate is essential for long-term potentiation, the neurobiological correlate for memory formation in the hippocampus. Thus, hypertension-associated cognitive decline may not only be mediated by structural atherosclerotic wall changes, but also by functional changes in neurotransmission.
