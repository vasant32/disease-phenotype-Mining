The paper is concerned with the results of a clinicomorphological analysis of 17 cases of Creutzfeld's-Jacob disease (CJD) in patients aged 39 to 78 years. The authors show polymorphism of the clinical manifestations at the early stages of the disease and the necessity of differentiation between atherosclerotic dementia and tumors of the profound parts of the brain and sometimes with the high pattern of lateral amyotrophic sclerosis. The problem of the clinical varieties of CJD is discussed.
