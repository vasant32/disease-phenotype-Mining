Central and cerebral hemodynamics was studied using echocardiography and transcranial dopplerography in 200 poststroke patients over 60 in the course of 5-year follow-up. It was established that cardiac hypodynamic syndrome, i.e. continuous or paroxysmal fall of minute blood volume below 3 l, is the most significant contributing factor in the onset of cerebral ischemia. Drugs are recommended for prevention of ischemic stroke. Those lowering cardiac hemodynamic reserve should be excluded in patients at high risk of acute failure of cerebral circulation.
