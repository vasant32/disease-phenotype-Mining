Atheromatous stenosis of the intracranial arteries is a major cause of ischemic cerebral events. To date, treatment has been medical. Percutaneous balloon angioplasty can be used to dilate intracranial arterial stenosis with an 80% success rate. This technique is still under evaluation but can be indicated in symptomatic patients after failure of a well-conducted anti-thrombotic regimen.
