BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: All studies reporting high numbers of Chlamydia pneumoniae DNA positives in stroke patients published to date have used polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques highly prone to generate false-positive results. The aim of this study was to analyze the prevalence of C. pneumoniae DNA in plaques of the carotid artery as well as in peripheral blood by means of a new, closed, real-time PCR system. METHODS: Carotid endarterectomy specimens and preoperative peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of 75 individuals with severe cerebrovascular atherosclerosis were analyzed by means of a C. pneumoniae-specific quantitative ompA-based real-time PCR TaqMan system. Plaques were also cultured onto HEp-2 cells. Before the surgical intervention, C. pneumoniae-specific IgM, IgG, and IgA as well as C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were determined. RESULTS: 89% of all patients studied had C. pneumoniae-specific antibodies, but the pathogen was not detected in a single carotid atheroma by real-time PCR and cell culture. However, C. pneumoniae DNA was detected in 4 PBMC samples (5.3%) at very low levels (<1 inclusion/6 mL EDTA blood). No statistical significance was found between symptomatic/asymptomatic patients, C. pneumoniae PCR, results and CRP values after correction for multiplicity-of-test adjustment. CONCLUSIONS: By means of a closed, highly sensitive, and specific real-time PCR, C. pneumoniae was not detected in cerebrovascular atherosclerosis. PCR on PBMC was not predictive for endovascular chlamydia infection and most likely stem from previous C. pneumoniae respiratory tract infection in individual cases.
