Genetic factors may play a role in susceptibility to stroke. The angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) gene is a candidate gene for two phenotypically different types of stroke affecting small perforating arteries: spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (SIH) and ischemic stroke due to small vessel disease (SVD). The authors report evidence that ACE gene DD homozygosity of the I/D polymorphism in intron 16 is an independent risk factor for SIH, and not for SVD stroke, in a Polish population.
