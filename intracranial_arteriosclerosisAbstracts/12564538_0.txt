Cerebral arteriosclerosis was observed upon necropsy of a 36-yr-old female captive polar bear (Ursus maritimus) that developed a sudden onset of seizure-like activity and died. The medium and large cerebral arteries of the meninges had moderate to severe diffuse discoloration and mineralization of the matrix of the tunica media, with little or no associated cellular reaction. Scanning electron microscopy of the affected arteries showed discrete crystalline calcified deposits in the media and sclerosis of the arterial wall. There were no lesions in the brainstem. The findings suggested a sudden and rapidly fatal loss of blood flow to the brain caused by long-standing arterial lesions. Incidental findings included numerous 0.1- to 10-cm-diameter, hepatic cysts lined with hyperplastic biliary epithelium, a unilateral, unipolar, 3-cm-diameter renal tubular adenoma, and approximately 250 active Baylisascaris sp. nematodes in the intestines.
