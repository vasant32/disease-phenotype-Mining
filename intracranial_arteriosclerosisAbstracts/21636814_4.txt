 BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: There were limited data on the long-term outcome of patients with symptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis ≥70% after Wingspan stenting. Using our Wingspan cohort data and the data from the Warfarin and Aspirin for Symptomatic Intracranial Atherosclerotic Disease (WASID) as a historical control, we tested the hypothesis that stenting provided no benefit over antithrombotic therapy alone for these high-risk patients. METHODS: Between January 2007 and February 2009, 100 consecutive patients with intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis ≥70% and symptoms within 90 days were enrolled into this prospective single-center Wingspan cohort study and followed up until the end of February 2010. Stenosis was measured per the WASID criteria. One-year risk of primary end point (any stroke or death within 30 days and ipsilateral ischemic stroke afterward) was compared with that of ipsilateral ischemic stroke in the WASID patients with ≥70% stenosis. RESULTS: The stent placement success rate was 99%. All patients but 1 had clinical follow-up of ≥12 months. During a mean follow-up of 1.8 years, 9 patients developed primary end point events (5 within 30 days and 4 afterward). The 1-year risk of the outcome events was lower than that in similar WASID patients: 7.3% (95% CI, 2.0% to 12.5%) versus 18% (95% CI, 13% to 24%; P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The clinical outcome of Wingspan stenting for high-risk intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis patients in this high-volume center study compares favorably with that of antithrombotic therapy alone. A randomized trial comparing medical therapy alone with medical therapy plus Wingspan stenting, conducted at high-volume centers, is needed to confirm the stenting benefit.
