We report three cases of autopsy-proven Binswanger's disease (subcortical arteriosclerotic encephalopathy) with unusual clinical features. Two patients had supranuclear gaze disturbances, early gait dysfunction, and speech disorders suggestive of progressive supranuclear palsy. One of these patients was not demented at the time of death. The third patient had features typical of Parkinson's disease. All three patients were responsive to treatment with levodopa. The clinical spectrum of Binswanger's disease should be expanded to include levodopa-responsive parkinsonism.
