Overall 130 patients with circulatory (atherosclerotic) encephalopathy were examined for the clinical picture, cerebral hemodynamics, specific features of the treatment and catamnesis at different disease stages. Use was made of ultrasound, rheographic and radionuclide research methods for intracranial arterial and venous blood flow. The data thus obtained were compared to the computer-aided tomography of the brain data. It has been discovered that cerebral hemodynamic disorders and brain atrophy are related to insufficiency of circulation via the main intracranial arteries and blood circulatory disorders in the microvessels. The clinical and hemodynamic efficacy of vasoactive and metabolic therapy (cavinton, piracetam, stugeron combined with complamine++) varied depending on the disease stage.
