The authors examined the effect of pravastatin 40 mg daily on the progression of ischemic brain lesions using repeated brain MRI. After a mean treatment period of 33 months, there was an increase in total ischemic lesion load of 1.1 cm3 (p < 0.001) in the 270 placebo-treated subjects and 1.1 cm3 (p < 0.001) in the 265 pravastatin-treated subjects. There was no difference between the two treatment groups (p = 0.73).
