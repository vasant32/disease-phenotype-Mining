A manual dexterity test was performed in a population of elderly women. Obese subjects with hyperostosis frontalis interna (HFI) had a poorer performance than subjects with either HFI alone or obesity alone. The combined effects of cerebral arteriosclerosis and HFI is suggested as a possible explanation for these findings.
