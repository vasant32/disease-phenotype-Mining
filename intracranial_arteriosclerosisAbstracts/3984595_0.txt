Thirty-eight atherosclerotic patients with chronic disorders of the cerebral circulation (CDCC) received 300 mg of complamin by intravenous drip. The clinical signs of vasodilation were noted at 5-15 min after the initiation of infusion whereas following it the findings observed included a significant reduction in the kinetic parameters of the myocardium and globular blood volume, an elevation in the peripheral vascular resistance and tone of the cerebral hemisphere vessels, a decrease in the pulse vascular resistance and tone of the cerebral hemisphere vessels, a decrease in the pulse blood-filling of the left carotid bed and deterioration of intracerebral venous congestion. Complamin is recommended for use to improve the rheological properties of the blood and microcirculation in patients with CDCC with elevated or normal myocardial contractility. Its application should be avoided in patients with low cardiac output and heart failure, in cases of labile arterial pressure and vascular dystonia with marked pulse variations in the cerebral vessels and also when the blood return to the cerebral veins is impeded.
