The author examined 55 patients with disorders of circulation in the vertebrobasillar basin where the most prevalent clinical signs were expressed in a cochleo-vestibular syndrome due to a lesion of the receptor apparatus of the inner ear. It was marked that in the clinical respect this syndrome was very similar to genuine Meniere's disease. The differential diagnosis of this disease is frequently very complicated. A detailed neurological and otoneurological examination demonstrated a combined lesion in the form of a simultaneous involvement into the process, of the inner ear, the brain stem and cerebellar hemisphere (in different varieties). Inasmuch as the blood supply is provided by the different branches of the anterior inferior cerebellar artery in a vascular brain disorder the clinical signs may be qualified as a variant of the syndrome of the anterior inferior cerebellar artery.
