The authors provide the results of a comparative study of exercise tolerance (bicycle ergometry test) in 64 patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) and in 68 patients with associated CHD and cerebral atherosclerosis. During the latter syndrome the working capacity was lowered as a result of less economical work of the circulatory apparatus. In particular, physical loading in such patients was accompanied by marked increment of the heart rate and blood pressure elevation. Increased heart oxygen requirement in the second group patients during exercise was accompanied by more frequent ischemic alterations in the myocardium attended by ST segment depression on the ECG. It is concluded that concomitant cerebral atherosclerosis aggravates the basic pathogenetic mechanisms of CHD, namely the disagreement between myocardium oxygen requirement and supply.
