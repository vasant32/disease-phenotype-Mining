Complex clinico-physiological examinations was performed in 300 patients of middle and old ages with early and pronounced dyscirculatory encephalopathy of atherosclerotic and, in most cases, hypertensive etiologies. The cerebral hemodynamics was found to be relatively independent of the central one in patients with early atherosclerotic encephalopathy; the level of the systemic circulation and that of the median regional cerebral flow were found to correlate in early and advanced hypertensive encephalopathy cases. The cerebral function was shown to be more associated with the cerebral flow in the early encephalopathy in elderly patients than in middle-aged ones. The individual and personal traits of the patients were largely related to the disease stage rather than to the predominant etiological factor.
