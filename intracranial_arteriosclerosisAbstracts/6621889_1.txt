In ten patients operated on by the senior author, arteriotomy and reconstruction of the vessel wall with interrupted sutures were performed. Four patients underwent resection of an aneurysm, three thrombectomy, and one embolectomy, while in two patients an atherosclerotic plaque with thrombus was removed. Operation was undertaken to create normal vessel volume and restore and maintain adequate regional blood flow. These objectives were attained completely in seven cases and only partially in two cases, whereas in one patient we failed to meet the above requirements.
