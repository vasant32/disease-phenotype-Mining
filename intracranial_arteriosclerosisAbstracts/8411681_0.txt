(1) In Japan, atherosclerosis in the extracranial arteries has now been more or less prevailing. (2) Many devices are widely used to extra- and intracranial vascular disease. However, such a simple sign as an auscultation of the carotid bruit or aortic-arch calcification in the X-ray picture may give valuable information of extra- and intracranial atherosclerosis. (3) Anti-heat-shock protein 64 antibody has recently been presented as an independent risk factor of carotid atherosclerosis. (4) Clinical features of carotid occlusion or stenosis are markedly variable. PET study has revealed that a water-shed ischemic zone may be in a state of "misery perfusion". (5) Regression may occur in the cervical as well as cerebral atherosclerosis.
