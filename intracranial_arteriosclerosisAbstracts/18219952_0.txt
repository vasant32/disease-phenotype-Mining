In order to clarify the role of the central nervous system in the genesis of arterial hypertension (AH) a population analysis of somatic pathology in schizophrenia was performed. Using clinical and postmortem data, the study found lower frequency of AH among mental patients vs. somatic ones; primary AH was benign independently of the psychotropic therapy regimen. II to III stage AH in psychosis was associated with primary or secondary renal pathology or magistral vessel atherosclerosis. Severe schizophrenia and a pronounced personality defect were associated with low intensity of the primary form of somatic nosology.
