With the purpose of studying abnormalities of carbohydrate metabolism in the acutest phase of ischemic insult we examined 39 patients within the first 10 days of the development of ischemic insult in cerebral atherosclerosis (30 patients) and hypertensive disease (9 patients) before and 60, 90 and 120 min after the peroral administration of 50 g of glucose or subcutaneous administration of 5 U of insulin using the histochemical method of identification of insulin in erythrocytes together with the biochemical method of measuring blood glucose. The degree of abnormalities of carbohydrate metabolism in such patients was found out to be dependent on the nosological form of the illness, severity of its course, and extent of affection of the brain.
