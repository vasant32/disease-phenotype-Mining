To define the etiologic factors of Japanese cerebrovascular diseases, a pathological research was conducted on autopsy cases of stroke in Akita Prefecture. In most cases of cerebral hemorrhages, especially in the middle age group (30-59 of age), arteriosclerotic deviations in basal berebral arteries of the circle of Willis and intracerebral small arteries are not found. The authors conclude that cerebral hemorrhage may occur without relationship to disturbances of lipid metabolism, biochemically, and to atherosclerosis, pathologically. Concerning cerebral infarction, especially in the old generation (over 60 years of age), severe arteriosclerotic deviations were recognized both in basal cerebral and intracerebral arteries. These changes were highly influenced by the grade and duration of hypertension, and rarely influenced by hypercholesterolemia. According to the above-mentioned facts, the results obtained from out epidemiological survey were confirmed by the pathological studies.
