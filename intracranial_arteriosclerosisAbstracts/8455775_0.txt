The authors report the clinical course and surgical technique used to treat a patient with a high-grade stenosis of the proximal middle cerebral artery that had caused a previous infarction and threatened the remaining dominant hemisphere. Trapping of the involved middle cerebral artery segment allowed direct exposure for excision of the atheromatous plaque and subsequent closure of the arteriotomy. Intraoperative angiography confirmed the reestablishment of flow. The patient made an uneventful postoperative recovery. Direct middle cerebral artery endarterectomy has the advantage of potentially reestablishing flow to lenticulostriate branches. The technique may also avoid the problem of occlusion at the site of maximum stenosis that can be caused by the use of an extra/intracranial bypass graft. Middle cerebral artery endarterectomy is a potentially valuable technique that deserves further investigation.
