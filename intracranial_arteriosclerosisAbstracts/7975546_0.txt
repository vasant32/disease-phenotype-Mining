Results have been analysed of comprehensive evaluation of 175 patients with discirculatory encephalopathy of atherosclerotic genesis, consisting of inspection of the neck vessels projection, study of neurological status, ultrasonic investigation of the major brain arteries structure and hemodynamics, their angiographic features. At stage I discirculatory encephalopathy subjective complaints predominated, being caused by syndrome of thoracic outlet, steal syndrome, stenosing lesions of brachiocephalic arteries. Encountered more frequently in the middle-aged and elderly patients were affections of several major brain arteries. Specific weight of correlation between ultrasonic investigation and angiography in stenosing lesions of brachiocephalic arteries in patients with discirculatory encephalopathy constituted 84-100%. Therefore patients with discirculatory encephalopathy of atherosclerotic genesis require ultrasonic investigation of brachiocephalic arteries with the purpose of finding out exactly the pathological process and choosing the tactics of treatment.
