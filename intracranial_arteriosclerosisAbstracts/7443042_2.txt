Fifty extra-intracranial arterial anastomoses were performed in 48 patients. The importance of a precise angiographic study in the pre- and post-operative period is emphasized. The different angiographic patterns of the anastomosis, its variation in time, the possible cause of failure, and the role played by the EIAB on the cerebral blood flow are described and discussed. The problems of extension and time of the postoperative angiographic examination, are also discussed.
