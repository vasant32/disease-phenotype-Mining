The benefit of platelet scintigraphy using 99mTc-phytate as a method to detect atherosclerotic lesions in extracranial neck vessels was tested on 143 patients. 29 patients had an abnormal scan of the neck vessels. The scintigraphic results were critically evaluated, taking clinical observations and the angiograms performed on 88 patients into consideration. Platelet scintigraphy can be useful as an additional examination in some patients. Generally, however, the value and reliability of platelet scintigraphy must be seen as insufficient, making further prospective studies with histological examinations imperative.
