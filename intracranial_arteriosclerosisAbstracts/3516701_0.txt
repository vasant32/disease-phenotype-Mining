Intravenous Digital Subtraction Angiography (i.v. D.S.A.) was performed at the carotid bifurcation level in 259 patients with clinical or physical findings of a Cerebrovascular Insufficiency (C.V.I.). The angiographic examinations have been performed during two different periods, basically differing for the technology of the digital equipment and for the technique used. The personal experience showed how these two factors are important in determining the quality of the image and therefore the accuracy of the i.v. studies. Images of good quality of the common and internal carotid arteries have been obtained in 73% and 54% of the cases of the first period and in 93% and 82% of the cases of the second period. The role of the i.v. D.S.A. in the management of the C.V.I. depends not only upon the quality of the images, but also upon the surgical policy and from the availability of ultrasounds.
