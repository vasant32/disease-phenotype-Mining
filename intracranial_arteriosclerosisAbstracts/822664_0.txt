By the method of a spectral analysis and intervalography the authors studied the changes of finger tremor in intellectual and nitroglycerine tests in 45 normals and 15 patients with funkctional disorders of the CNS. The studies demonstrated some similarities between the frequency characteristics of the physiological tremor and the EEG. On the basis of electromyographical examination of 115 patients with cerebral atherosclerosis the authors systematized different forms of pathological tremor according to the topical principle. The conclusion is made that the state of the brain has a certain influence on the dynamics of the periodical structure of tremor.
