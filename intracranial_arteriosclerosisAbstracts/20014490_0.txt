 OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship of the polymorphism of SG13S114A/T in ALOX5AP gene with atherosclerotic cerebral infarction (ACI). METHODS: By polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism, polymorphism of SG13S114A/T in ALOX5AP gene in 412 cases with ACI and 368 non-ACI controls were analyzed. RESULT: There were no statistically significant differences in the ALOX5AP gene SG13S114 AA genotype and A allele frequencies between ACI group and control group (P>0.05). CONCLUSION: The results do not support genotype SG13S114 A allele as the risk gene for ACI.control group.
