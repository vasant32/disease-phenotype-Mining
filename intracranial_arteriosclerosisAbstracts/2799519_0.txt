Blood serotonin levels have been measured by spectrofluorometry in 145 patients with various manifestations of acute disorders of the cerebral circulation (ADCC): with ischemic stroke, cerebral hypertensive crises, transient impairments of the cerebral circulation, and with circulatory encephalopathy (DE) in the presence of arterial hypertension combined with atherosclerosis. In ADCC patients the blood serotonin has been measured 7 times, in DE ones 3 times. This level has been found changed in the patients with ischemic stroke and with cerebral hypertensive crises for a long time after the cerebral circulation impairment. Serotonin levels correlated with the condition severity and course in ADCC and DE. The vestibulocerebellar syndrome in DE has been treated more effectively, particularly with trental. The blood serotonin level may be regarded as a prognostic criterion of the disease outcome and of the treatment efficacy.
