Because of the deleterious consequences of strokes the detection and therapy of risk factors are particularly important. After a short description of the different subtypes of stroke and their age distribution the possible risk factors are discussed. The leading factor is arterial hypertension, followed by diabetes mellitus, but smoking, hyperlipemia and obesity are not held to be definite risk factors. In spite of the positive correlation between age and stroke incidence, aging is probably not a risk factor by itself, but it is accompanied by higher frequencies of other risk factors.
