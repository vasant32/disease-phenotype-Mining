Calcium pangamate (CP) in patients with the cerebrasthenic syndrome of atherosclerotic genesis facilitates a decrease in the cholesterol index of atherogenicity due to increased levels of serum high-density lipoproteins (HDLP). One of the factors contributing to an increase in HDLP levels in the patients' blood serum under the impact of CP is the stimulation of the phospholipid incorporation into HDLP.
