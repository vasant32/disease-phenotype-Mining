51 cases of subcortical arteriosclerotic encephalopathy (SAE) diagnosed by CT were reviewed, the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of CT in SAE were discussed. The pathologic basis of SAE is thought to be arteriosclerotic changes in small penetrating cerebral arteries, which cannot be seen directly by CT, however, the resulting histo-pathologic alterations which include widespread patchy areas of demyelination and small infarcts could be demonstrated on CT image. It is surmised by the authors that these changes in white matter seen on CT are responsible for clinical deterioration of the patients.
