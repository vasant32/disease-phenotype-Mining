BACKGROUND: It remains unclear whether high-sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP) is predictive of atherosclerosis in the intracranial artery. The aim of this study is to assess the role of hs-CRP in asymptomatic intracranial artery occlusive diseases. METHODS: Of the 3,366 apparently healthy subjects who received a brain checkup, 138 with > or =25% intracranial artery stenosis on magnetic resonance angiography, 267 with > or =25% extracranial carotid artery stenosis on B-mode ultrasonography and 435 without intracranial artery or extracranial carotid artery stenosis (age-matched controls) were selected for this study. RESULTS: The mean CRP concentration in the subjects with intracranial artery stenosis was not significantly different from that in the control subjects, and the differences of mean CRP concentrations among the subgroups with 25-49, 50-74 and 75% or greater stenosis in the intracranial artery were not significant. The odds ratios of hs-CRP for extracranial carotid artery stenosis tended to increase with increasing CRP concentrations, but those of hs-CRP for intracranial artery stenosis showed no significant difference. CONCLUSION: The degree of atherogenic inflammation in asymptomatic intracranial artery stenosis may be less than that in extracranial carotid artery stenosis.
