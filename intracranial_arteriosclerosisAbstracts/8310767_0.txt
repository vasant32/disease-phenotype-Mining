The carotid arteries of twenty-five patients with transient ischaemic attacks, minor stroke or amaurosis fugax were examined by conventional angiography, the ultrasonic duplex technique and supraorbital fluorescein angiography (SOFA). The results of the last two techniques (non-invasive and minimally invasive, respectively) were compared with the results of angiography. We found that the ultrasonic duplex technique is highly sensitive and specific for both high and low-grade carotid stenoses while the less costly SOFA can only identify stenoses equal to or more than 75%. However, since tight stenosis has proved to be an indication for surgical reconstruction, SOFA - or possibly the still simpler procedure with direct ocular inspection of the supraorbital fluorescence pattern without any recording - would be useful for initial screening in smaller units without access to ultrasonic duplex examination. In this way potential candidates for surgery can be identified without delay and forwarded to larger units for further supplementary examinations.
