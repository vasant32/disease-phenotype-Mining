This study investigated how fibrinogen and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels change in response to neural damage occurring after ischaemia, and the relationship between the distribution of the arterial lesion, the disease prognosis and the levels of these substances. Fibrinogen and CRP levels were measured in blood samples obtained from 83 patients admitted to hospital within 72 h of a first ischaemic stroke. The patients were evaluated clinically with the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS), and results were compared with 43 age-matched controls. The fibrinogen and CRP levels in unconscious patients with hemiparesis or hemiplegia were higher than those in conscious hemiplegic patients. Also, the difference in GOS values between the unconscious patients with hemiparesis or hemiplegia and conscious patients with hemiparesis or hemiplegia was statistically significant. Patients with large infarcts in the median cerebral artery and anterior cerebral artery had higher fibrinogen and CRP concentrations than the control group. In conclusion, fibrinogen and CRP may be important measures for determining the prognosis and outcome in patients following ischaemic stroke.
