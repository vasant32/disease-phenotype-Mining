Studies of the circadian rhythm in plasma 11-O.H.C.S. levels showed that a subgroup of affective psychotics had higher plasma 11-OHCS values as compared with schizophrenic and other psychotic subgroups, and a somewhat less regular rhythm. One patient with depression who was studied over 48-hour periods showed a reduction in plasma 11-OHCS levels with clinical recovery. An accentuated fall and rise in plasma 11-OHCS values in the night and early morning samples, respectively, was observed in the schizophrenic subgroup.
