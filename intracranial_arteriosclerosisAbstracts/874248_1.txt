A combination of three psychiatric screening tests was used to uncover the extent of affective-psychotic symptoms, the indications of "chronic brain syndrome," and the perceptual limitations among two selected populations of elderly persons. It was found that 25% of 48 residents in a home for the aged, and 9% of 45 members in a social club, had four or more affective-psychotic complaints. In the former group, 75% had symptoms of moderate to severe "chronic brain syndrome," versus 7% in the latter group. Among the residents of the home, 10% had serious disturbances as measured by all three tests. The significant number of affective-psychotic symptoms found in this population with extensive manifestations classifiable as "chronic brain syndrome" indicates that this diagnosis should not be allowed to preclude regular psychiatric evaluation of these elderly patients. When a specific diagnosis is established, available treatment modalities should be provided as needed.
