BACKGROUND: Adiponectin is a protein secreted by adipose cells that improves insulin sensitivity and possesses antiatherogenic properties. In this study, we investigated the relationship between adiponectin levels and ischemic stroke subtype. METHODS: Using clinical, imaging, and laboratory data, 231 consecutive patients admitted to a university medical center over a 2-year period with acute cerebral infarcts were categorized into four subtypes: intracranial atherosclerosis (n = 67), extracranial atherosclerosis (n = 61), small arterial occlusion (n = 63), and cardioembolic (n = 40). Clinical features, risk factors including the presence of metabolic syndrome, and levels of s-adiponectin were compared between groups. RESULTS: Patients with more severe metabolic abnormalities were more likely to have lower s-adiponectin levels (p = 0.002). S-adiponectin levels differed by stroke subtype: highest in the cardioembolic group and lowest in the intracranial atherosclerosis group (8.42 +/- 5.07 vs 5.60 +/- 2.79 microg/mL, p = 0.01). Extracranial atherosclerosis (6.45 +/- 4.10 microg/mL) and small arterial occlusion (6.07 +/- 3.44 microg/mL) groups were intermediate. Patients with advanced intracranial atherosclerosis (> or =1 additional lesion outside the symptomatic arterial territory) had lower s-adiponectin levels than those with isolated intracranial atherosclerosis (4.95 +/- 2.63 vs 6.13 +/- 2.84 microg/mL, p = 0.003). In multiple regression analysis, s-adiponectin levels, but not metabolic syndrome, were independently associated with intracranial atherosclerosis. CONCLUSIONS: Symptomatic intracranial atherosclerosis is associated with lower s-adiponectin levels vs other ischemic stroke subtypes.
