Classifications of Parkinsonism in the past have induced an "arteriosclerotic" variety and vascular etiology has thus been proposed. However, controversy exists whether such an entity actually exists, because there has not been a single pathologically verified case with adequate clinical correlation. We report a case with clinical syndrome indistinguishable from Parkinson disease and postmortem examination revealing extensive lacunar infarction of the basal ganglia without evidence of coexistent Parkinson disease. This case provides pathologic confirmation for the concept of vascular Parkinsonism.
