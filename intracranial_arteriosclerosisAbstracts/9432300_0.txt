Out of a group of patients aged 60 years and more with the diagnosis of psychasthenic form of cerebral arteriosclerosis complicated by hyperlipoproteinaemia three subgroups matched for sex, education, social class and place of residence but differing in disease duration were isolated, and three analogous subgroups were selected from healthy subjects which were regarded as controls in the statistical analysis. As the results of statistical analysis it was found that in elderly patients, taking of hypolipaemic drugs influenced evidently negatively the emotional sphere, and that short duration of neuro- and psychasthenic forms of cerebral artery atherosclerosis had greater influence on the frequency of conflicts in nearest surroundings since short duration of the disease probably made impossible full adaptation and acceptation of the disease. The attention was paid to the necessity of introduction of psychotherapy into hypolipaemic treatment.
