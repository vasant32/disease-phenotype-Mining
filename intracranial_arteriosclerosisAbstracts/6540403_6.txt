Nine patients had intraluminal filling defects identifiable as clot within the internal carotid artery at angiography. Thrombus was unilateral in eight, bilateral in one. Eight of the 10 clots were attached to atheromatous plaques. Three patients had serious concurrent illness: pancreatic cancer, rheumatoid arthritis with arteritis, and chronic pulmonary disease with polycythemia. In three patients, the clot was related to severe atherosclerosis. In three other patients, all young, the carotid thrombi remained unexplained though two of these patients had coagulation abnormalities. No patient had a new stroke after surgical or anticoagulant treatment.
