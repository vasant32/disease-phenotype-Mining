We report the clinical and neuropathological findings in an autopsy case of progressive dementia, Parkinsonism, pseudobulbar palsy and supranuclear ophthalmoplegia. Since 70 years old, this hypertensive patient developed forgetfulness, unsteady gait and festination. These symptoms rapidly worsened and he was admitted in October 1983, at age 71. He had severe dementia and showed stiff face. Voluntary vertical movement of the eyes was severely disturbed, but reflex vertical movement by the doll's head eye maneuver was not affected. Muscle tone in the limbs increased slightly, and deep tendon reflexes were hyperactive in jaw and the upper extremities. Babinski sign was negative bilaterally. Sensation and coordination remained normal. Although he was not paretic or ataxic, his movements were very slow. He could not stand by himself and easily fell backward. These clinical features resembled those of progressive supranuclear palsy except for severe dementia and rapid progression. Brain CT scan revealed marked dilatation of the lateral ventricles, prominent periventicular lucency and atrophy of brainstem and cerebral cortex. Treatment with levodopa slightly improved his movement, but difficulty in swallowing worsened increasingly. He died of hypoglycemic coma and aspiration pneumonia in September 1984, about two years after the initial symptoms. General autopsy showed severe pneumonia and atrophy of the liver. The brain weighed 1,210g. Atherosclerotic change in the cerebral arteries were mild. Coronal sections of the cerebral hemispheres revealed diffuse ischemic change and multiple small infarctions in the bilateral cerebral white matter. Cortical atrophy was observed in the cerebral hemispheres. The basal ganglia, thalamus, and pons showed status lacunaris. Atrophy of midbrain and depigmentation of the substantia nigra were observed macroscopically.
