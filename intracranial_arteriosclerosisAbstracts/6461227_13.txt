Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty was used to treat atherosclerotic lesions in 22 brachiocephalic arteries in 20 patients during a 2 1/2 year period. Seven subclavian, 13 vertebral, one external carotid, and one common carotid arteries were involved. Nineteen arteries were successfully dilated, but dilatation of two vertebral arteries and attempted recanalization of one subclavian artery failed. The first patient treated was still asymptomatic at 30 months and no symptoms recurred in any of the successfully treated patients. No complications were encountered during these procedures.
