Two patients with atherosclerotic ischemic cerebrovascular disease presented with transdural anastomoses. A 74-year-old woman had a cerebral infarct, and a 76-year-old man had dementia. Patients with atherosclerotic ischemic cerebrovascular disease may have developed transdural anastomoses, so care must be taken not to damage these functions during revascularization surgery.
