AIM: To specify risk factors of vascular complications at a predialysis stage of renal failure. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The trial enrolled 165 patients with chronic renal failure (CRF) aged 46 +/- 15 years, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) - 37.2 (35.02-40.83) and arterial hypertension (96%). The examination included ultrasound dopplerography of the common carotid arteries (CCA) and common femoral arteries (CFA) for detection of atherosclerotic plaques (AP), estimation of the thickness of arterial intima-media, elasticity and rigidity of the vascular wall. Factors of risk for atherosclerosis and cardiovascular complications were assessed. RESULTS: Aortic atherosclerosis was detected in 60 patients, that of cardiac vessels, brain, kidneys and lower limbs - in 35, 30, 23 and 8 patients, respectively. Acute cardiovascular complications occurred in 13 patients. Main atherosclerosis risk factors were age, body mass index, systolic and pulse arterial pressure, disturbances of phosphorus-calcium metabolism. Structure and function of CCA and CFA were studied with dopplerography in 37 CRF patients. Increased intima-media thickness was associated with age, male sex, overweight, hypercholesterinemia, systolic and pulse arterial pressure. Body mass index, GFR, creatinin level were independent factors of intima-media thickness. Abnormal elasticity of CCA was related to hypertension, CFA - to hypercholesterolemia.
