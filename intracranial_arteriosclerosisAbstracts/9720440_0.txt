Atherosclerosis is the primary disease in the majority of patients with ischemic brain disease (IBD). Etiopathogenesis of atherosclerosis has not been more precisely defined, but risk factors significant for its generation and development, so as for IBD development, have been identified. They were designated as risk factors for brain atherosclerosis (RFBA). The aim of this study was to establish the frequency and significance of RFBA association in the patients with acute IBD in relation to IBD severity. The investigation included 60 patients with AIBD. RFBA were: arterial hypertension, dyslipoproteinemia, diabetes and smoking. For all the patients included in the study detailed history was noted, daily glycemia profile was done, blood pressure was measured 3 times a day and parameters of lipid status with counting of LDL/HDL indices and Apo A1/Apo B were determined. IBD was confirmed by computerized tomography of brain. The degree of IBD severity was determined in all the patients by Grotta's scale. After the statistical processing, the results of the research showed that in the patients with IBD the most frequent were arterial hypertension, then smoking, dyslipoproteinemia and diabetes. In significant number of patients existed association of several factors, which was in significant positive correlation with the degree of IBD severity. It was concluded that risk factors for atherosclerosis were simultaneously risk factors for IBD. IBD is the most severe, final stage in evolution of brain atherosclerosis.
