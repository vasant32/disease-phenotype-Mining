Some of the disturbances encountered in patients with chronic cerebral vasculopathies may be attributable to associated or concomitant pathologies such as arterial hypertension. In many of the papers published on citicoline it is less than clear whether the improvement in the symptoms is the result of the treatment of the hypertension or the substance used. In conclusion, the importance of correct treatment of hypertension in order to cure certain standard chronic cerebral vasculopathies is emphasised and the value of citicoline in improving kinesthesis, mnemonic and perceptive-motor efficiency is confirmed.
