Sleep spindles are an EEG sign of light sleep under physiological conditions. We reported the simultaneous occurrence of sleep spindles and alpha activity in the waking EEG in 12 patients with a mean age of 59.0 years. Most of the patients were diagnosed as cerebrovascular disorders such as cerebral arteriosclerosis, transient ischemic attack and vascular dementia. The mean alpha frequency in the presence of WSA significantly decreased by 1.5 Hz. The frequency and spatial distribution of waking spindle activity were similar to those of sleep spindles. In our cases, at least the two factors of cerebrovascular involvement and older adults were considered to be primarily responsible for the intrusion of sleep spindles into wakefulness (presumably a state close to very light drowsiness) due possibly to the instability of sleep-waking cycle regulation.
