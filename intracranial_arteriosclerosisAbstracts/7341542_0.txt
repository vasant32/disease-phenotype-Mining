Platelet hyperaggregability was tested in 62 TIA patients by means of the formalin fixing principle of Wu and Hoak. Compared to age-matched controls, the platelet aggregates ratio (PAR) was reduced from 0.99 +/- 0.04 SD to 0.807 +/- 0.14 SD. This means a highly significant increase of circulating platelet aggregates (CPA) in untreated TIA patients, regardless of the interval sinche the last attack (from 2 days to 1 year). PAR was especially reduced in patients with abnormal angiography (expressing pronounced cerebral or diffuse ATS) and it was possibly affected by previous antiplatelet treatment with ASA.
