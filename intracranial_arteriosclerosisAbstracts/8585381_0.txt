The microcirculatory state (by the method of conjunctival biomicroscopy) and ADP-induced platelet aggregation were examined in 42 patients with atherosclerotic and 34 patients with involutional depression both before and after the treatment which included vasoactive preparations and calcium antagonists. It was determined vascular and intravascular alterations predominance and increase of platelet aggregation in patients with atherosclerotic depression independently of leading syndrome, in patients with involutional depression with anxiety prevalence as well as in patients in stuporous state. The tendency was revealed of such disturbances increasing as for as psychosis was extended. Trental and Cavinton antiplatelet and spasmolytic properties were potentiated by inclusion of Corinfar in complex therapy and that promoted earlier microcirculatory alterations removal as well as aggregatograms and patient mental state normalization.
