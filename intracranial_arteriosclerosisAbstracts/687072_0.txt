The literature data regarding the incidence of coronary, cerebral and lower extremity atherosclerosis in diabetes are reviewed. A retrospective assessment of data relating to in-patients of the Umberto I Hospital Medical Division during 1972-1975 showed that atherosclerosis occurs more often and earlier in diabetics. It is more frequent in women over 50, especially in the case of coronary forms. A similar high incidence of vascular lesions is also noted in subclinical forms. This is particularly true of coronary sites in females and lower extremity sites in males. It is clear that screening for glucose intolerance in all vasculopathic subjects, coupled with careful genetic and familial investigation, are essential acids to preventive and social medicine in this particular sector.
