Results of complex neuroophthalmological examinations of a group of patients with transient disturbances of the cerebral circulation are considered and discussed. On the basis of clinical, rheoencephalographic, electroencephalographic, ophthalmocalibrometric, ophthalmodynamometric, biomicroscopic (of the conjunctiva vessels) and other ophthalmoscopic findings it has been concluded that the transient disturbances of the cerebral circulation can be differentiated both topically and pathogenetically: this may serve as a basis for individualized pathogenetic therapy.
