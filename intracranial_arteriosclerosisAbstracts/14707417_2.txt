BACKGROUND: The feasibility of a noninvasive evaluation of remodeling of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was assessed. The results were correlated with magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and transcranial color Doppler (TCD) findings. METHODS: 26 patients (13 male and 13 female, age ranged from 46 to 82 years) who presented with symptoms of cerebrovascular accidents had TCD, MRA and MRI assessment of the MCA. The TCD and MRA findings of 40 MCAs accessible by TCD were correlated with the ratio of cross-sectional area of the vessel (VA), luminal area of the vessel (LA) and plaque load (PL). RESULTS: The VA ratio and LA showed no correlation with TCD or MRA results. PL however was shown to be associated with both TCD and MRA. CONCLUSIONS: MRI could be used to assess remodeling in MCAs. PL was found to be associated with TCD and MRA findings.
