The authors examined morphologically the arteries of the surface and intracerebral arteries of the cortex and white substance of different areas of the cerebral hemispheres in 11 necropsies of patients with arterial hypertension who died from hemorrhagic strokes. It was established that arteries of the cerebral surface 200-500 micron in diameter were characterized by compensatory-adaptive processes reflecting structural adaptation of the vessels to a prolonged elevation of blood pressure. The intracerebral arteries were considerably more frequently characterized by changes induced by hypertonic crises expressed in the form of plasmorrhagias and isolated necrosis of the tunica media. The cortico-medullary arteries 100-150 micron in diameter were predominantly affected which accounts for a more severe damage to the cerebral white substance in arterial hypertension.
