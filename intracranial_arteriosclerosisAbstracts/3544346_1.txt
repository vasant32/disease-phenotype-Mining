Bilateral occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) trunk theoretically should be a very severe condition, but its actual prognosis has never been studied. Nine of 1,377 patients (7 Asians, 1 Black, 1 Caucasian) from the Cooperative Study of Extracranial/Intracranial Arterial Anastomosis were found to have atherosclerotic bilateral occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) trunk before entering the trial. Three presented with a stroke followed by a contralateral stroke, two experienced a unilateral stroke, two had a unilateral stroke preceded by ipsilateral TIAs, one had a unilateral stroke preceded by TIAs on both sides and one experienced isolated unilateral TIAs. Retrograde filling to the distal MCA was universally present. During follow-up (mean: 45 months), only one (non-operated) patient had further cerebrovascular events, and ultimately a fatal stroke. One additional patient died of sepsis and one had a silent myocardial infarct. All survivors resumed their previous activities. This study shows that in bilateral MCA trunk occlusion, the long-term prognosis is reasonable in the patients who do not present with a devastating stroke.
