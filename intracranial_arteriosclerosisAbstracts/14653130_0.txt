OBJECTIVE: To investigate the efficacy of Tianlong Xifeng granule (TXG) in the treatment of ceroarterosclerosis (CAS) with Gan-yang-hua-feng Zheng(GYHFZ). METHODS: Patients with CAS were randomly divided into 2 groups: 122 patients in the treatment group were given TXG, while 60 patients in the control group were treated with Ginkgo Biloba capsule. Clinical symptom, blood lipid and transcranial doppler ultrasound were observed before and after the treatment. RESULTS: The symptom, elasticity of the cerebral blood vessel, and the speed of blood flow were significantly improved in the treatment group, and the efficacy of the treatment group was superior to that of the control group. Blood lipid was effectively reduced, and no toxic and side effects were found in both groups. CONCLUSION: TXG has ideal therapeutic effect on CAS patients with GYHFZ.
