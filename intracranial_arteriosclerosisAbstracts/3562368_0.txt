The cause of stroke in a young adult can usually be ascertained with proper workup. One of the most common causes is atherosclerotic cerebrovascular disease, and cigarette smoking is an important risk factor in young adults. Several types of nonatherosclerotic cerebral vasculopathy can also result in premature cerebral infarction; these include cervicocephalic arterial dissection, nonpenetrating traumatic arterial disease, moyamoya disease, fibromuscular dysplasia, vasculitis, and migraine. Cardiac embolism may play a more important role than was previously thought, and hematologic disorders (eg, sickle cell disease, polycythemia rubra vera, coagulation problems) are known to predispose patients to stroke. A careful history of risk factors and a thorough neurologic and cardiovascular examination followed by adequate testing, including angiography, are essential to diagnosis.
