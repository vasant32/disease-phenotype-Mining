Brains were autopsied from 167 patients aged 70 to 91 that had senile dementia, vascular CNS lesions, these ailments combined, and mentally normal subjects. Cerebral Congophilic angiopathy was evidenced in all senile dementia patients with or without vascular CNS disease. The stage-by-stage amyloid formation was shown with regular involvement of the field 17. Pathogenesis of dysoric angiopathy is discussed. Of particular importance is the fact that cerebral Congophilic angiopathy did not develop in "pure" vascular CNS disorders.
