Intelligence was evaluated in 73 normal civil pilots (control) and 70 with atherosclerotic cerebral vessels including 23 men with atheromas. Intelligence was evaluated with the use of computerized EPI (Gorbov's modification). Pilots with cerebral atherosclerosis tended to slightly decrease mean IQ values in comparison with the normal; IQ values remained high enough to attest professional efficiency. Atheromas did not impact results of the numerical (IQ2) and verbal (IQ3) tests. Hemodynamically negligible stable atheromas did not disturb cognitive functions of the pilots and, therefore, they were certified for continuation of the flight career.
