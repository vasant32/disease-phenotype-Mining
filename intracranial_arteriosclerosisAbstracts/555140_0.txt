In geriatric examinations, the old patients' looks should be observed. Based on the observation of 100 old subjects (aged 65 to 92), the author classifies the old people into 4 categories of looks. 1. Cheerful-eyed 2. Sad-eyed 3. People with fixed (lifeless) gaze 4. Wicked (aggressive) looking people. Category I can be treated easily; category 2 will co-operate in anti-depression therapy; category 3 exhibits mainly Parkinson's disease, in need of anti-sclerotic treatment. In the case of people with fixed gaze, the side-effects of drugs should also be suspected. Subjects in category 4 are difficult to treat. They do not co-operate with the physician. The administration of psychopharmacas, sedation and anti-sclerotic treatment are recommended.
