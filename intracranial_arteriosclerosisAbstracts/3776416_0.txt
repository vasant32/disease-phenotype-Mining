The authors investigated the diagnosis and treatment of the initial forms of venous encephalopathy in atherosclerosis in 42 patients, using synchronous rheoencephalography and jugular rheophlebography under conditions of graded exercise on a bicycle ergometer. The study revealed signs of venous encephalopathy with dystonic, asthenovegetative, psychopathological, pseudotumorous and other syndromes which were confirmed by changes in the parameters of the REG, rheophlebogram, etc. Graded exercise in a compensated phase of the disease led to a reduction in signs of venous congestion in the brain, while in a subcompensated phase these signs increased. The effect of a multiple modality treatment with due regard to the phase of compensation and the leading syndrome was good or satisfactory in the majority of patients.
