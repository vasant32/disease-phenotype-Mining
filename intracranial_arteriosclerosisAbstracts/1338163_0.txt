As many as 33 men with initial manifestations of brain blood supply insufficiency and transient disorders of brain circulation associated with cerebral atherosclerosis were examined for the vegetative characteristics (tone in the cardiovascular system, reactivity, physical activity supply) during age-associated hormonal rearrangement. RIA was used to measure the blood serum content of peripheral sexual hormones (testosterone, estradiol) and the content of gonadotropic hormones of the pituitary (follicle-stimulating and luteinizing). It has been revealed that the hypersympathetic direction of vegetative functions is combined with remarkable changes in the content of sex steroids in the form of testosteronemia and hyperestradiolemia. This dictates the necessity of correcting the function of the autonomic nervous system and the hormonal status.
