After a short synopsis of the at present ascertained knowledge of the anatomy and pathophysiology of the cerebral blood supply the possibilities of the vascular-surgical treatment are discussed. The desobliteration of extracranial vessels, PTA, vascular resections and appliances of bypass are no concurrent operation techniques, but such ones which are individually to be adapted. The importance of the clinical and non-invasive diagnostics is put before the digital subtraction angiography and the direct angiography. On the basis of the experience of 461 own surgical interventions the stage-conditioned diagnosis is required. Stage II of the transitory ischaemic attack is preferred. In unilocular mediastenoses the extra-intracranial anastomosis now as ever hat its qualification.
