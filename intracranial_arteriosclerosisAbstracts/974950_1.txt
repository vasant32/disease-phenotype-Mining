Stabilomety, a method of measuring stability of stance or postural equilibrium in man, consists of transforming the mechanical oscillations of man's "physiologic gravicentre" into electric signals, then amplifying, recording and analysing the signals. The frequency, duration and mean and maximum amplitudes of oscillations, and coefficients reflecting the influence of vision, differ in patients with various neurologic diseases and from values in healthy subjects. The method is highly sensitive and accurate, simple and rapid to use, lacks danger and discomfort and permits screening of a large number of people in a short time.
