The fine-structural localization of apoB, the major protein constituent of both the low and very low density plasma lipoprotein fractions, was described in human middle cerebral and basilar arteries. Using an immunoperoxidase technique together with electron microscopy, apoB was localized only in arteries with atherosclerotic involvement and to the following regions in these arteries: 1. on the outer aspects of extracellular spherical structures with diameters of 250 to 700 A found predominantly in lipid cores and between bands of collagen fibers of advanced atherosclerotic lesions; 2. on the surface of reduplicated elastica; 3. along collagen fibers and; 4. on aggregates of extracellular spherical lipid globules. These results suggest that the extracellular spheres may represent the fine-structural morphology of deposited low and very low density lipoproteins and that free apoB may be bound to lipid globules, elastica, and collagen fibers.
