Hemosorption was included in combined treatment of 110 patients with atherosclerotic dyscirculatory encephalopathy combined with coronary heart disease. The effect was assessed on the basis of clinical improvement, psychological tests, blood lipid assays, compressed spectral EEG analysis and ultrasonic flowmetry of the carotid arteries. The effectiveness of hemosorption was demonstrated at all stages of the disease, with the regression of general cerebral and focal neurologic symptoms preceding clinical remission of coronary heart disease. Hemosorption was shown to have good effects on blood lipids, cerebral circulation and EEG spectrograms.
