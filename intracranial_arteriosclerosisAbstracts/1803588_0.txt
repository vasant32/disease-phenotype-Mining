The level of glycosylated hemoglobin (Hb AIc), the concentration of glycosylated proteins in red blood cell membranes (GPCM), and fructosamine were measured in patients with different carbohydrate metabolism abnormalities (glucose tolerance test disorders, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus/IDDM/). The "pyrene" probe was used to examine rheological disorders in different shift rates and microviscosity of red blood cell membranes. Close correlations were established between glycosylated proteins and microviscosity as well as between GPCM and viscosity of red blood cell suspension. In addition to an increase of the content of glycosylated proteins, deterioration of the rheological properties, and a rise of microviscosity associated with hypoxic phenomena, a group of patients suffering from IDDM with low microviscosity and graver clinical manifestations (microangiopathies, coronary heart disease, cerebral atherosclerosis) were distinguished. Low microviscosity can also be seen in normoglycemia. The cumulative action of the hemorheological shifts, a decrease of red blood cell deformity accompanied by tissue hypoxia favour the development of diabetic angiopathies. A possibility is revealed of the use of microviscosity of red blood cell membranes together with Hb AIc as markers of early carbohydrate metabolism abnormalities and early microcirculatory disorders.
