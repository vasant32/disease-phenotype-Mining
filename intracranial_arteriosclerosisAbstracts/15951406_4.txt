BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The authors determined the technical success and the clinical and angiographic results of angioplasty and/or stent placement for intracranial atherosclerotic disease (ICAD) at a tertiary-care referral hospital. METHODS: Angiographic and clinical outcomes occurring within the 1-month follow-up interval were recorded. Patients were followed up for a mean period of 20.5 +/- 9.2 months, and a neurovascular imaging study was performed in 18 of the 21 patients alive after a mean period of 19.7 +/- 9.2 months. Stroke-free survival and ipsilateral stroke-prevention rates were estimated using Kaplan Meier analyses. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients (mean age = 61.0 +/- 13.5 years; 15 were men) underwent 30 procedures for treatment of ICAD. The procedures included angioplasty (n = 18) and attempted primary stent placement (n = 14). In 2 procedures, angioplasty was performed in the same session after unsuccessful stent placement. There was immediate stenosis reduction (mean +/- SD) from 84% +/- 17% to 27% +/- 21%. The overall 1-month composite rate of major stroke, death, and major bleeding complications was 7% for the 30 procedures. Overall stroke-free survival at 36 months was estimated as 79% (95% confidence interval, 57%-91%), and the ipsilateral stroke-prevention rate was estimated to be 87% (95% confidence interval, 65%-95%). Among the 15 patients who underwent repeat angiography, restenosis requiring second intervention was observed in 1 patient. No restenosis could be identified in 3 patients who underwent computed tomographic or magnetic resonance angiography. CONCLUSION: This single-center study demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness (for secondary stroke prevention) of angioplasty and/or stent placement for treatment of ICAD.
