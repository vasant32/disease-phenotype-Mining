Two patients who had typical vertebrobasilar transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) that were refractory to anticoagulation with dicumarol and to antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and/or dipyridamole are described. Angiography revealed in both patients a stenotic atherosclerotic plaque of the intracranial vertebral artery between the posterior and anterior inferior cerebellar arteries. At operation, the first patient had an atherosclerotic plaque extending into the basilar artery, and no endarterectomy was attempted. The second patient had a 1-cm localized plaque that was removed successfully from the vertebral artery. Neither patient sustained a neurological deficit as a result of the operation. The patient whose plaque was not removed at operation continues to have vertebrobasilar TIAs and suffered a brain stroke 2 weeks after operation. The patient whose plaque was removed at operation continues to be free of TIAs 8 months later, and angiography performed 3 months after operation showed a widely patent vertebral artery. A portion of the intracranial vertebral artery has now been shown to be accessible to endarterectomy using the operating microscope. Angiography is helpful in determining this accessibility preoperatively.
