Seventeen patients aged 40 to 69 years with cerebral atherosclerosis and peripheral atherosclerotic changes treated for 6 months with Anginin were investigated psychologically. The purpose of the investigation was assessment of the effects of Anginin on certain higher psychic functions and motor fitness, duration of drug effects, and the influence of patients' attitude on health improvement. The investigations comprised a set of 10 psychometric tests assessing objectively the state of different kinds of memory and motor fitness, that is those functions which are most frequently disturbed in cerebral atherosclerosis, and evaluation of the symptoms associated with the disease (in the light of interviews). Each patient was investigated 4 times with parallel sets of tests: before starting treatment, after 3--4 months of treatment, 6 months after the beginnning of treatment, and 6 months after completion of treatment. Seven patients received placebo during the first 2 months. Statistically analysed results showed that during the treatment immediate and delayed visual and auditory memory increased, visumotor coordination improved and disturbances of attention concentration and motor fitness were alleviated. After 3--4 months of treatment the results of the tests for these functions improved further. The effect of Anginin lasted for 6 months after comletion of treatment showing only a slight tendency for decrease. The analysis of symptoms and comparison of the placebo group with the drug group demonstrated a high influence of the attitude of the patient on health improvement, and the psychotherapeutic effect of the drug was considerable. The good effects were obtained in cases with moderately severe and slight intensity of disturbances.
