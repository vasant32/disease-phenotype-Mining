Fifty-seven cases admitted to the Karolinska Hospital 1973-1976 with the diagnosis transient cerebral ischemia were reviewed. Seventeen cases were excluded as not fulfilling the strict TIA definition. An analysis of the records and the supplementary questionnaire of the remaining cases showed considerable sex differences in the stroke-prone profile. In the male group arteriosclerosis in the extracranial cerebral arteries was demonstrated in 90% of these examined by angiography. In the female group factors recognized as interfering with the coagulation system were obvious in more than 70% and two women had fibromuscular dysplasia. These differences may have therapeutic and prognostic implications. In the total material only 35% had hypertension. Diabetes was not present in any of the patients. Of the men 46.6% had abnormal blood lipids against 15.4% of the women. Seventy-five percent of the patients with verified arteriosclerosis were regular smokers. At a mean follow-up time of 18.7 months only one patient, in the untreated group, developed completed stroke.
