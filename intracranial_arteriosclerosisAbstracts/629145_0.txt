The presentation deals with the enzymatic spectrum of the blood serum (aminotransferase-glutamino-pyruvic and glutamino-oxaloacetic acid, sera cholinesterase, histidase, acid alkaline phosphatase) in 100 patients with transient disorders of cerebral circulation in the form of ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes. These disorders of circulation appeared on the background [corrected] of atherosclerosis and hypertensive disease or in other combination along with vasculitis of a different etiology. The most significant were changes of histidase and acid phosphatase activity and an inhibition of cholinesterase activity in ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes with expressed focal disorders of cerebral circulation. In an improvement of the clinical state following medicative therapy there was a normalization of these indices. The only exclusion was histidase the content of which in some cases remained cunhanged.
