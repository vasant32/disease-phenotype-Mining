The clinical trials on 31 patients with arteriosclerosis and I-II stage discirculatory encephalopathy to assess an ability of Ascovertin to limit hemorheology abnormalities were carried out. In patients with discirculatory encephalopathy was a distinct increase in blood viscosity which was induced by disturbances of cell rheological factors: increase in aggregation of erythrocytes and decrease in their deformability were observed in comparison with indices in the group of healthy volunteers. No difference in plasma viscosity and fibrinogen was found. The treatment with Ascovertin in patients with discirculatory encephalopathy improved their attention, memory, mental performance, normalized sleep, releaved headache, decreased fatiquebility, led to the decrease in blood viscosity values, the reduction of pathological erythrocyte hyper aggregation and the improvement of erythrocyte deformability. We partly connect this clinical effect and hemorheology activity of Ascovertin with its antioxidant property--there was found impressive lipid peroxidation suppression. No significant changes in hemorheological and lipid peroxidation indices were observed in patients without Ascovertin.
