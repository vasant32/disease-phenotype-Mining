Serum-lipoproteins were determined in male and female patients aged under 55 who had survived an attack of ischaemic cerebrovascular disease (I.C.D.). The results were compared with findings in healthy controls. Total serum triglyceride and cholesterol concentrations were not increased. However, in the very-low-density lipoprotein fraction increased cholesterol concentrations were found, and the mean value of high-density-lipoprotein (H.D.L.) cholesterol in I.C.D. patients was 18% lower than in controls. Since a low H.D.L.-cholesterol concentration has been suggested as an independent strong risk factor, it is possible that the susceptibility of I.C.D. patients to atherosclerosis is the result of a low H.D.L. rather than hyperlipoproteinaemia.
