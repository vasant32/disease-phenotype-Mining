Analysis of 1385 autopsies of 80-102 year-old patients was performed to investigate the frequency of simultaneous occurence of the following functionally pertinent diseases in one organism (polypathia): Severe aortic, coronary and cerebral arteriosclerosis, chronic pulmonary emphysema, contracted kidneys, fractures of the femur and malignant tumors. 80% of all patients of both sexes suffered from 2-4 of the above diseases. Even in the highest age group, however, 5 and more of the above diseases were very rarely developed. Patients with none of the above diagnoses were almost never encountered. The "polypathia" was stated also in patients who died by suicide or accident.
