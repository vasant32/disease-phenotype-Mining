The value of the spin lattice relaxation time (T1) obtained during nuclear magnetic resonance imaging of the brain in patients with Idiopathic Parkinson's disease with and without dementia is studied. T1 increases significantly in the basal ganglia and cerebral white matter of the demented and nondemented groups. T1 of the cerebral white matter correlates with the severity of dementia.
