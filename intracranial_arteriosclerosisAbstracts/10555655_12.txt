BACKGROUND: Previous studies of patients with bilateral intracranial vertebral artery (ICVA) disease were selective and retrospective. METHODS: We studied risk factors, vascular lesions, symptoms, signs, and outcomes in patients with bilateral ICVA disease among 430 patients in the New England Medical Center Posterior Circulation Registry. RESULTS: Forty-two patients had bilateral ICVA occlusive disease (18 had bilateral stenosis; 16, unilateral occlusion and contralateral stenosis; and 8, bilateral occlusion). The most common risk factors were hypertension (32/42 [76%]) and hyperlipidemia (22/42 [52%]). Sixteen patients (38%) had transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) only; 18 (43%), TIAs before stroke. Occlusive vascular disease also involved the basilar artery in 29 patients (69%), the extracranial vertebral arteries in 18 (43%), and the internal carotid arteries in 11 (26%). Only 6 patients had no other major vascular lesion. Cerebellar symptoms were common. Among 30 patients with infarction, 21 (70%) had proximal intracranial territory involvement, and 15 (50%) had distal territory involvement. The location of occlusive lesions in relation to posterior inferior cerebellar artery origins did not significantly influence prognosis. During follow-up, 31 patients had no symptoms or slight disability, 2 had progression, and 7 died. Among 7 patients with poor outcome, 6 also had basilar artery stenosis or occlusion and 5 had proximal and distal intracranial territory infarcts. CONCLUSIONS: Most patients with bilateral ICVA occlusive disease have hypertension, other major occlusive lesions, and TIAs before stroke. Short- and long-term outcomes are usually favorable, but patients with bilateral ICVA and basilar artery-occlusive lesions often have poor outcomes.
