Data on the clinical and angiographic examinations of 192 patients with stenoses of the extracranial part of the carotid artery are compared. The state of the intracranial branches of the median cerebral artery was evaluated with the use of Ring-Waddington's grid. Seven neurological syndromes resulting from the pathology of the intracranial branches of the carotid artery system are specified. In 70% of the cases structural changes of the intracranial vessels were revealed, these changes being the most likely due to thromboembolism from the stenotic carotid artery. The anterior parietal branch was involved less frequently, and the posterior branches of the median cerebral and the orbitofrontal arteries were affected extremely rarely.
