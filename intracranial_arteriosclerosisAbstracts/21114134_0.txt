 OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate whether genetic variations in the eNOS gene were associated with intracranial and extracranial atherosclerosis in Koreans. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed data on 282 consecutive Korean patients with atherosclerosis in intracranial (ICAS) or extracranial vessels, and compared with 300 healthy individuals. The eNOS gene polymorphism was analyzed by PCR and direct sequencing. RESULTS: All genetic variants were single nucleotide polymorphism, two in the coding sequence (C774T and G894T) and one in intron 6. The frequency of the G894T polymorphism was significantly higher in the coronary atherosclerosis group than in the control group, but its presence did not correlate with other clinical risk factors. There was no significant difference in genotype and allele frequencies between coronary atherosclerosis and ICAS. CONCLUSION: The G894T polymorphism in the eNOS gene might influence coronary atherosclerosis rather than ICAS in Koreans.
