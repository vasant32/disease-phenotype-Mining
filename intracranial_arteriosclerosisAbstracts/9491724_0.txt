Effects were studied of vincamin and tanakan in 68 patients with stage I, II and III discirculatory encephalopathy (as per WHO classification 1981). In 52% of the patients atherosclerosis of brain vessels was associated with arterial hypertension (group I), in 48 per cent venous discirculatory encephalopathy was diagnosable against the background of arterial hypertension (group IIA-20%) and arterial hypotension (group IIB-26%). Both tanakan and vincamin were found to be effective in group I patients; however, in stage III condition their effectiveness was no better than 42 and 15% respectively, which fact might be due to organic changes in the vascular wall. Tanakan appeared to be more beneficial in group II patients since venous dystonia is considered to be the main pathogenetic link in this context, and tanakan is known to improve the venous outflow from the cranial cavity. Almost in one-third of group IIB patients vincamin worsened general health status, especially so in stage III discirculatory encephalopathy, which fact may be related to peculiar effect of the drug on the arterial link of brain blood supply.
