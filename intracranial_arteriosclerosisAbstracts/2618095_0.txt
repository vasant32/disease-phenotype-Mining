Concerning 150 patients suffering from acute cerebrovascular insufficiency we asked the following questions: 1. How often did cardiac decompensation occur, 2. How often did hypertension and hypertrophic symptoms occur in the electrocardiogram, and 3. How often did arteriosclerosis of the cerebral and coronary vessels occur together in deceased patients? Among the patients examined were 47.3% who showed symptoms of cardiac decompensation. Hypertension was found in 60.7% of the patients. The combination of symptoms of hypertrophy in the electrocardiogram and cardiac dysrhythmia was registered 39 times (26.0%). Arteriosclerosis was found in 68.2% of the post-mortem examinations. A high correlation was found between the sclerosis of the intracranial cerebral vessels (65.9%) and the sclerosis of the coronaries (75.0%). The possibilities of the prevention and deceleration, resp., of cerebrovascular insufficiency by early therapy of hypertension and of cardiac decompensation are pointed out.
