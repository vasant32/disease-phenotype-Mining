Overall thirty-five patients with ischemic insult against the background of occlusive lesions of major arteries of the head were evaluated for effects of cardil on systemic and cerebral hemodynamics and rheologic properties of blood. It has been shown that cardil increases significantly cerebral bloodflow predominantly on the side of the stenosis, does not cause intracerebral "stealing" in the acute phase of insult, improves bloodflow to the brain and collateral blood supply in the residual phase due to selectivity of its influence on cerebral vessels, lowers arterial pressure, decreases frequency of contractions, as well as cardial and stroke indices, and volume of circulating blood. The drug suppresses aggregatory properties of thrombocytes and erythrocytes during different stages of ischemic insult, and makes blood viscosity somewhat less.
