A 37-year-old woman suffered from sudden hemiparesis due to an ischemic stroke. Physical examination revealed dysmorphic features, cognitive impairment, and emotional lability. Radiological studies showed multiple intracranial arterial stenoses, and laboratory examination revealed diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and endocrinological abnormalities consistent with secondary amenorrhea. Karyotyping disclosed partial monosomy of the short arm of the X chromosome. We diagnosed the patient with Turner syndrome and concluded that premature atherosclerosis was a cause of stroke. We emphasize a possible relationship between strokes and Turner syndrome. Physicians need to manage adult Turner patients carefully, especially with regard to metabolic dysfunctions, to prevent strokes.
