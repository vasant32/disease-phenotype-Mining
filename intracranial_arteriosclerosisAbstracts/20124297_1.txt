Angioplasty and stenting of the cervicocerebral arteries is a novel treatment for atherosclerotic stenosis, which has periprocedural complications. Data were collected prospectively from 2007 to 2009 in a multicenter cohort of patients undergoing interventions for cervicocerebral stenosis. Retrospective assessment of the 2003-2006 archives of the same interventionists and a review of their published work is the second part of this national survey. In 592 extracranial internal carotid artery angioplasty and stenting procedures in 581 patients (73% male; mean age, 63.4 + or - 7 years), transient ischemic attack, stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, and death occurred in 1.7%, 1.7%, 0.34%, and 1.52%, respectively. In 114 extracranial vertebral artery angioplasty and stenting procedures in 110 patients (68% male; mean age, 65.3 + or - 6 years), transient ischemic attack and stroke each developed in 1 (0.92%) patient, but there was no intracerebral hemorrhage or death. In 70 intracranial angioplasty and stenting procedures in 67 patients (76% male; mean age, 68.5 + or - 8 years), transient ischemic attack, stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, and death were observed in 1.4%, 8.6%, 1.4%, and 2.9%, respectively. The frequency of periprocedural complications in angioplasty and stenting of cervicocerebral arteries by our neurointerventionists was similar to that in developed countries.
