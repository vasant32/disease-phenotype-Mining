Altogether 225 patients with transitory derangements of cerebral circulation (TDCC) underwent clinico-laboratory examinations. Arterial hypertension and cerebral atherosclerosis turned out to be among most frequently occurring factors of TDCC. The provoking factors included psychoemotional stress and drops of barometric pressure. The course and outcome of TDCC were greatly affected by an increase in blood concentration of catecholamines and thyroid hormones. The high concentration of triiodothyronine in the blood contributed to the development of cerebral stroke.
