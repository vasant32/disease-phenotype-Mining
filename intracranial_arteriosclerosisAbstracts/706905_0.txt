A neuroophthalmological examination of 89 patients with disorders of circulation in the basin of the posterior cerebral arteries demonstrated different variants of changes in the visual field and a drop of visual acuity. The visual disturbances in most of the cases were stable, sometimes with positive dynamics and only in 15% of the cases they were transient. The traits of visual disturbances, their combination with other neurological changes (visual-gnostical, visual-spacial impairment of memory) were connected with lesions of separate vessels of the vertebro-basillar and carotid systems. With the aid of functional tests in some cases hardly perceptible, insignificant disturbances in the system of the visual analyzer, permitting to correctly evaluate the visual changes and to establish their relation to certain vascular bains, were revealed.
