Based on the analysis of findings from clinical and paraclinical investigations (ultrasonic vascular diagnosis, electroencephalography, computerized tomography, angiography) in 244 patients with atherosclerotic dyscirculatory encephalopathy, functional status was studied as were structural alterations in the brain tissue in stenosing lesions of precerebral arteries. The first clinical manifestations of atherosclerotic dyscirculatory encephalopathy in the presence of damage to the vestibular-basilar system were found to be dysfunction of column structures of vestibular apparatus, reticular formation and posterior longitudinal fascicle, and, in the presence of damage to the carotid area, -- dysfunction of cortex of frontal, parietal and temporal lobes of the brain.
