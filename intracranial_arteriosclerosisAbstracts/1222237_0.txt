A study of the participation of the smooth muscle cells in the formation of atherosclerotic lesions was made on the autopsy material with the use of specific antiserum to the smooth muscle actomyosin and of indirect Coons' method. Typical forms of atherosclerotic lesions in the aorta, cerebral vessels and coronary arteries were studied. Smooth muscle cells were detected in the thickened intima alongside the atherosclerotic lesions, in fatty streaks, in the fibrous tissue of the atherosclerotic plaque, but they were not found in the atheromatous masses. The proliferation and migration of the smooth muscle cells is regarded as an essential factor in the pathogenetic mechanisms of atherosclersis.
