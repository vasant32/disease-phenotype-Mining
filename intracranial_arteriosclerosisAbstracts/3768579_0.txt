One hundred and seven elderly female in-patients with confirmed or suspected diagnoses of dementia were assessed by the Paired-Associate Learning Test (PALT), and the Cognitive Assessment Scale (CAS) and Behaviour Rating Scale (BRS) of CAPE. Eighteen months later, 62 patients were still alive. These had significantly better scores on the 'easy' set of PALT and on BRS than the non-survivors; the differences on the 'mediate' and 'hard' sets, and on CAS, while in the predicted direction, were not significant.
