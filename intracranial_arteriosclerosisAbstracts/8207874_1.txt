A clinicopathological study of senile dementia of Alzheimer's type (SDAT) accompanied by the white matter lesions of Binswanger's type was carried out. Fifty-seven patients, who were diagnosed as suffering from SDAT based on clinical and pathological criteria, were classified into two groups based on the white matter lesions of Binswanger's type. Namely, group 1 consisted of the SDAT patients without any subcortical or white matter lesions (30 cases); group 2 consisted of those with white matter lesions of Binswanger's type (11 cases). The other 9 cases included those with vascular lesions and 4 with some of the same pathological changes found in Parkinson's disease. Clinically, group 2 patients showed subcortical symptoms such as urinary incontinence, Parkinsonian gait, being accompanied by hypertension and arrhythmias. Periventricular lucency (CT) were common in group 2. Macroscopically, both groups showed moderately to severe atrophy, and the width of the corpus callosum of group 2 was narrower than that of group 1. There was no difference in cerebral arteriosclerosis between the groups. In microscopic findings, patients in group 2 showed diffuse distribution of cortical changes such as senile plaques as well as Alzheimer's senile plaques as well as Alzheimer's neurofibrillary tangles while those in group 1 showed various types of diffuse or local distribution. Arteriolosclerosis of the white matter were found in both groups. There was no difference in aortic atherosclerosis and/or heart disease. The complication of white matter lesions of Binswanger's type was not a rare finding in SDAT.
