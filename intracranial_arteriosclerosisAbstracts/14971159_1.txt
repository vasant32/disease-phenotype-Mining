Sixty patients with chronic hepatitis of various etiology at the stage of hepatic cirrhosis with hepatic encephalopathy syndrome (HES), thirty patients with cerebral atherosclerosis with dyscirculatory encephalopathy (DE) and 60 healthy controls have been examined in the study of basic diagnostic criteria of encephalopathies by short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) serum levels. Sensitivity and specificity of this test was also evaluated. Gas-liquid chromatography determined SCFA in the feces and peripheral blood serum from the above examinees. It was found that relative consent of SCFA and for the most part profiles of propionic and fat acids, acids with long chains, SCFA isomers in patients with encephalopathy of different genesis correlate with the results of clinical, laboratory and psychometric methods of examination and should be used together. Basic criteria are devised.
