The aim of the present study was to measure the volume of atherosclerotic plaques using three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound imaging of the carotid arteries and to reduce intra- and interexaminer variabilities in follow-up scans of atherosclerotic plaques. The noninvasive quantification of human atherosclerosis by 3D ultrasound was performed by a 3D computer-based image reconstruction (3D ultrasound). The linear movements of the transducer were driven by a motor triggered by ECG. The method included an option to change angle insonation and a correction of skin contact adaptation. Repeated measurements were performed in a weekly interval in 60 patients. Three evaluation procedures (manual tracing, threshold procedure, watershed algorithm) were developed. Intraexaminer mean variability varied between 2.8 (watershed algorithm) and 4.4% (threshold procedure). Interexaminer mean variability ranged from 3.8 (manual tracing) to 6.8% (threshold procedure), follow-up measurements from 5.3 (watershed algorithm) to 8.9% (threshold procedure). The newly developed 3D computer-based image reconstruction allows repeated quantification of moderate atherosclerosis with a low variability and will be applied in prospective studies of the regression or progression of atherosclerosis.
