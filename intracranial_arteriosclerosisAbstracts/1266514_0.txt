The author conducted a dynamic measurement of skin temperature and the neurovascular reflex in 179 patients with atherosclerotic psychoses. It was possible to eliminate a new diagnostical index which was named by the author as an index of skin-temperature asymmetry. It was established that the skin temperature in such mental disorders is 2-3 degrees lower than in normals while the index of skin-temperature asymmetry is 3-4 times more than in normals and the neurovascular reflex is weakened.
