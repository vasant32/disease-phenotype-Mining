The complex medical examination was performed in 145 patients admitted to the neurological department with initial diagnosis: "ischemic stroke". We compared anamnesis, clinical symptoms, laboratory and instrumental findings in the patients with verified ischemic stroke and in those without stroke. The significant clinical predictors of ischemic stroke were the following: arterial hypertension (> 165/ 95 mm Hg) age 64 years and older, circulatory insufficiency, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, lower extremity obliterating atherosclerosis, pneumosclerosis and pulmonary emphizema.
