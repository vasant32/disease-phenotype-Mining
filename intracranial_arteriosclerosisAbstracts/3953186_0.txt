On the basis of radiocardiographic and radiocirculatory examination of the central and cerebral hemodynamics in 130 patients with dyscirculatory encephalopathy (DE) caused by essential hypertension and atherosclerosis, the authors have demonstrated that the development of DE is facilitated by disturbances of the central and peripheral hemodynamics. In turn, DE reduces the function of the autoregulatory mechanisms of the cerebral blood flow and leads to insufficiency of compensatory adaptive possibilities of the cardiovascular system. It is recommended that not only cerebral disorders but also the type (hyperkinetic, hypokinetic, eukinetic) of the blood circulation in these patients be taken into consideration in selecting the optimal method of treatment.
