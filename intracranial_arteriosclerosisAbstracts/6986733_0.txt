The authors studied the platelet functional properties and the brain bioelectric activity in 20 patients with acute cerebrovascular diseases before and after subcutaneous injection of 2.0 ml of racemic camphor T, as well as before and after oral taking of monobromated camphor in a dose of 0.5 g 3 times a day. The platelet aggregation was examined by the method of Born (1962) with automatic recording of aggregatograms. The brain bioelectric activity was examined using an Alvar electroencephalograph. As a result, the authors discovered an inhibitory effect of camphor preparations on the platelet aggregation. Racemic camphor T and monobromated camphor were found to produce a stimulant effect on the brain.
