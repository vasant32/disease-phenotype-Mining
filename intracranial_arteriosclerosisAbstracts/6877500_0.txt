The authors analysed the effectiveness of Lipanthyl treatment in 38 patients after stroke undergoing rehabilitation treatment. The effects of the drug were evaluated on the general condition, neurological and psychic status, progression of motor rehabilitation, and on lipid metabolism parameters. A statistically significant improvement was obtained in the subjective and psychic condition, and the results of motor rehabilitation were slightly better than in the compared groups of patients. Lipid metabolism was normalized only in part (cholesterol, chylomicrons). In the conclusions the authors state that it is useful to give this drug to patients with cerebral atherosclerosis only if disturbances of lipid metabolism coexist with this disease and are refractory to dietetic treatment.
