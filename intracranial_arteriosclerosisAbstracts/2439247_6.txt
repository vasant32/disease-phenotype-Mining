We describe six patients with chronic hypertension, atherosclerotic vascular disease and periventricular leukoencephalopathy (PVL) on CT. PVL was combined with cortical infarcts in one and with lacunar infarcts in five patients. On neuropsychological examination all patients showed the characteristic features of a subcortical type of mental deterioration. Clinico-radiologic correlation suggests a direct association of PVL and subcortical dementia, and it is argued that prominent cortical features in the dementia of patients with vascular disease and PVL suggest the concomitant presence of Alzheimer's disease.
