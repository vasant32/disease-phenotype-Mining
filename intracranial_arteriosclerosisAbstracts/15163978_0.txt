One-stage reconstructions on the brachiocephalic and lower limb arteries are most often linked with a risk of perioperative acute coronary insufficiency. Retrospective analysis of the results of surgical treatment of this group of patients has demonstrated an opportunity of successful simultaneous operations when performing aortofemoral reconstructions from the mini-laparotomy access. This is ensured by minimization of surgical trauma, blood loss and the time of operation. Provided the coronary reserve of the heart is appreciably lowered, it is advisable that one-stage operation may be declined.
