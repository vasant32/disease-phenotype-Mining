The localization of fibrinogen and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) in the arterial wall has been studied to determine whether they mediate the effects of hypertension and/or hypercholesteraemia on atherogenesis. In untreated control rabbits, fibrinogen was localized in the caveolae and vesicles of the endothelial cells and in the subendothelial spaces of the aorta. No fibrinogen was found in the subendothelial spaces of the cerebral artery. Hypertension or hypercholesteraemia was accompanied by enhanced insudation of fibrinogen into the subendothelial spaces of the aorta and cerebral artery, and fibrinogen deposition was most prominent in the hypercholesteraemic rabbits with induced renovascular hypertension. The insudation of fibrinogen appeared to occur by way of vesicular transport, and to some extent by junctional transport. In the untreated control rabbits, LDL was localized only in the caveolae and vesicles of endothelial cells in both aorta and cerebral artery. LDL was deposited in the subendothelial space of the aorta of hypercholesteraemic rabbits with or without hypertension, and in the cerebral artery of hypercholesteraemic rabbits with hypertension. These findings suggest that fibrinogen insudates into the intima of the aorta and cerebral artery both during hypertension and hypercholesteraemia, and that LDL insudation into the intima of the aorta in hypercholesteraemia is accentuated by hypertension. LDL insudated into the intima of the cerebral artery in the presence of hypercholesteraemia linked to hypertension. Thus, hypertension plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of cerebral atherosclerosis.
