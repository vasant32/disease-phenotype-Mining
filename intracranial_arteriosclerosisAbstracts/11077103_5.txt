BACKGROUND: Stereotactic radiosurgery is increasingly used for the treatment of medically unresponsive trigeminal neuralgia. CASE DESCRIPTION: We present the case of a 69-year-old man with trigeminal neuralgia who underwent stereotactic radiosurgery after a failed balloon compression procedure. The radiosurgery also failed to provide the patient with any significant pain relief, and microvascular decompression of the trigeminal nerve was performed 10 months later. At operation, two adjacent veins and the superior cerebellar artery were noted to have focal changes consistent with atheromatous disease. CONCLUSION: We postulate that the recent radiation exposure resulted in the observed vascular injury. As a result, patients having trigeminal neuralgia radiosurgery need to be followed carefully for possible delayed ischemic events secondary to radiation-induced vascular injury.
