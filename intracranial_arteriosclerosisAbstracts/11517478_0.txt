The characteristics of accumulation of autoantibodies (aAbs) on NMDA-type glutamate receptors were studied in blood of patients at different stages (1-4 days, 5-7 days, 8-14 days, up to 28 days) of acute period of ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke. The stability of low values (1.29 +/- 0.31 ng/ml) of the titer of aAbs to NMDA-receptors was revealed in patients with acute cerebral hemorrhage. Two types of titer of Abs to NMDA-receptors were revealed in case with cerebral ischemia. The undulating nature of Abs titer changes was revealed in acute ischemic strokes caused by hypertension and cerebral atherosclerosis (from 2.23 +/- 0.53 ng/ml on the 1-st day with increase up to 3.23 +/- 0.90 ng/ml and up to the 3-4 day), following fluctuations with less pronounced increase on 7-8th day were found out. High titer of aAbs to NMDA-receptors (up to 10.0 ng/ml) were observed on 3-4th day in cases of acute ischemic strokes on the background of chronic alcohol encephalopathy caused by intoxication or dysmetabolism with their retention up to 10-14th day.
