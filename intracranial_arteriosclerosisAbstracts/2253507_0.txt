This report presents the study on inherited relationship of levels of lipids and lipoprotein in 20 nuclear families of patients with arteriosclerotic stroke through application of analysis of correlation and regression. The results showed that the levels of serum lipids between spouses had little or nearly no correlation; and that between mid-parent and their children had positive or significant positive correlation, and so did that between siblings. It seems that the genetic factor have an important influence on levels of serum lipids in members of nuclear families of patients with arteriosclerotic stroke.
