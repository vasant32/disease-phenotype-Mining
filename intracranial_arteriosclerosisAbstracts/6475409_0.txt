This is a report on 20 autopsies of patients with arterial hypertension and atherosclerosis who died of a hemorrhagic stroke. Morphological changes characteristic of hypertonic angioencephalopathy were detected in the intracerebral vessels and cerebral substance. They included plasmorrhagia with arterial stenosis and necrosis, miliary aneurysms, isolated necrosis of the pia mater attended with vascular deformation, complete and incomplete necrosis of the cerebral substance, gliomesodermal cicatrices, perivascular hemorrhages, lacunar infarctions at various stages of their progression, etc. The pathomorphological classification of cerebral circulation impairments has thus incorporated an additional notion "hypertonic angioencephalopathy".
