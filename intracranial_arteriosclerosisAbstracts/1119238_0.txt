The authors examined 350 patients with initial forms of cerebrovascular atherosclerosis. Among the studied group 98 had discirculatory disorders. All patients were studied for the eye ground, intraocular and retinal pressure. The following clinical symptoms characterized this group of patients: antigiospasms, organic changes in the arterial vessels of the retina, changes in the peripapillar zones, in a normal eye retraction, a drop in the diastolic retinal pressure. Glaucoma was depicted in 27%. In patients with a tendency to cerebral paroxysms and transient disorders of cerebral circulation there were more distinct and more frequent symptoms of angiospasms, as well as signs of organic changes in the retinal arteries. The authors mark an increase in the systolic and retinal pressure and an asymmetry of it. Glaucoma was depicted in 3% of the cases.
