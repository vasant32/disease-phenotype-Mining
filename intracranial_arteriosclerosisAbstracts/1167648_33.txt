Symptomatic intracranial vasculopathy developed in four patients following irradiation for central nervous system tumors. All the patients presented with a stroke-like picture from 2 to 22 years after the completion of radiotherapy. Two of the patients showed abnormalities on arteriography consisting of narrowing of the supraclinoid portion of the internal carotid artery and the adjacent proximal anterior and middle cerebral arteries. Although the risks of radiotherapy for central nervous system tumors of malignant potential are outweighed by potential benefit, the risks should be carefully considered in cases of tumors with little or no malignant potential.
