Acute disturbances of the cerebral circulation occupy the leading place in the structure of neurovascular diseases. Studies on metabolic processes in the patients, body in the acute period of the stroke and, particularly, the metabolism of free amino acids enable one to expand our knowledge of the pathogenetic essence of the stroke and its differential diagnosis, and thus to decide on the therapeutic measures to be taken for correcting the disturbed metabolism. Of great interest in this connection are dynamic determinations of the levels and the spectrum of free amino acids in biological fluids.
