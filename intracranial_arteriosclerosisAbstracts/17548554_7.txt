We studied 590 asymptomatic villagers aged > or =40 years in Liangbei County in central rural China and found 41 subjects (prevalence 6.9%) with intracranial atherosclerosis. In a multivariate analysis, the significant risk factors for intracranial stenosis were hypertension (OR 2.53; 95% CI 1.12 to 5.72), glycosuria (OR 3; 1.19 to 7.97), heart disease (OR 4; 1.39 to 11.6), and family history of stroke (OR 5.2; 1.38 to 20). Intracranial atherosclerosis is not uncommon among asymptomatic Chinese subjects.
