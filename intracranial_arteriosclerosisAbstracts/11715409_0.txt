OBJECTIVE: To explore the association of variance at XbaI site of apolipoprotein B (ApoB) gene and atherosclerotic cerebral infarction (ACI) in Chinese Han population. METHODS: Using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques, we studied the restrict fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) at XbaI site of ApoB gene in 150 patients with ACI and 301 healthy age, sex-matched individuals from a population of Chinese Han nationality in Beijing. RESULTS: In both ACI group and control group, X-X- genotype was the most frequent one (frequency: 0.907, 0.948) and we did not find X+X+ genotype. The distribution of genotypes in the two groups was at the Hardy-Weiberg equilibriums. The frequency of rare allele X+ was significantly lower in Chinese Han than that reported in Caucasians (0.027 vs 0.418, 0.454, 0.479, P < 0.01). The higher frequency of rare allele X+ was found in the ACI group as compared with the control group (0.053 vs 0.027, P < 0.05). markedly increased levels of TC (5.3 +/- 1.3), (4.9 +/- 1.3) mmol/L (P < 0.05), and low levels of Apo-AI, Apo-AI/ApoB in the ACI group were observed (1.02 +/- 0.34), (1.26 +/- 0.40) g/L, (P < 0.01); X+X- genotype was associated with higher levels of ApoB compared with the levels of X-X- genotype in the ACI group (0.89 +/- 0.29) g/L, (0.78 +/- 0.17) g/L (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: X+ allele of ApoB gene may be associated with ACI to some extent in the Chinese population, and presumbly through its effect on ApoB metabolism it increases the susceptibility to ACI.
