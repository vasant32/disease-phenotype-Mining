An analysis of 617 cases of cerebral strokes was done, including 534 acute and 83 past ones treated in the years 1966-1972. The patients were divided into 4 groups: I -- cerebral haemorrhage, II -- cerebral embolism, III -- cerebral arterial thrombosis, IV -- failure of cerebral circulation. The classification was based on clinical criteria and in dying patients also on autopsy findings. ECG changes were analysed in all patients. In the acute period of stroke the greatest proportion of cases were cerebral arterial thrombosis (197 cases --37%) and in this group acute myocardial infarctions were most frequent. This group was followed by cases of acute cerebral circulatory failure (191 cases -- 35%). The electrocardiographic correlate of the cerebral changes were in this group signs of myocardial ischaemia (84 cases -- 15%). Cerebral embolism (134 cases -- 24%) was associated with arrhythmia (109 cases --19) of various origin. In the group of cerebral haemorrhages (95 cases -- 17%) no unequivocal ECG changes were observed. In all patients with myocardial infarction during cerebral stroke atheromatous changes of coronary arteries were present. No correlation was observed between the location of the cerebral focus and the type of electrocardiographic changes.
