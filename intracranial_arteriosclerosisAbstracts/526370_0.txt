Fusiform Aneurysms are encountered in elderly persons with advanced arteriosclerosis. When they are enlarged to compress the neighboring structures, they may resemble tumors symptomatically. Especially when situated in close relation to the optic nerve or chiasmatic region, pituitary tumor is likely to be suspected. This is a case of 62 year old female with a giant fusiform aneurysm of the right internal carotid artery extending to the middle cerebral artery which caused left homonymous hemianopsia and a large aneurysm in the cavernous portion of the left internal carotid artery with fusiform extension of the distal portion of the carotid artery which presented left blepharoptosis, dilated pupil and total ophthalmoplegia. The basilar artery and the right meningohypophyseal artery showed fusiform dilatation as well. Systemic atherosclerotic change, abdominal aortic aneurysm, nephrosclerosis were also accompanied. The computed tomography demonstrated the aneurysms distinctly. Left oculomotor palsy disappeared after six months with residue of left homonymous hemianopsia. Surgical intervention was not attempted, because of the widely distributed constitutional aneurysms in the whole body.
