The study deals with the clinico-anatomical examination of 75 cases of hemorrhagic strokes where diagnostical and therapeutical surgical measures were performed. Arterial hypertension was found in 73 cases. In 35 cases there were changes in the extra- and intracranial areas of the carotid and vertebral arteries and arteries of the brain basis. In almost all the cases after surgical interferences there were repeated disorders of brain circulation which were much more rarely seen in patients without the above-mentioned pathology. The reported results indicate the importance of a special study of the magistral cerebral arteries and the brain basis with hemorrhagical strokes for criteria of a necessity of operations in intracranial hemorrhages.
