Medically refractory, symptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic disease has a poor prognosis. Based on the results of the Warfarin-Aspirin Symptomatic Intracranial Disease study, the risk of ipsilateral stroke at 1.8 years is between 13 and 14% in patients with symptomatic intracranial atherosclerosis. Synergistic advances in intracranial angioplasty and stenting, modern neuroimaging techniques, and periprocedural and postprocedural antithrombotic regimens are creating new models for the diagnosis and successful endovascular treatment of intracranial stenosis. In this article, the most recent clinical developments and concepts for the diagnosis and endovascular treatment of intracranial atherosclerotic disease are discussed.
