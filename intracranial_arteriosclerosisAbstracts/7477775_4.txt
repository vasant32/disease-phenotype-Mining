The relationship between cerebrovascular aneurysmal disease and atherosclerosis remains unclear. Elevated serum levels of lipoprotein (a) (Lp[a]), are an independent risk factor for atherosclerosis. We measured serum Lp(a) levels in 50 patients who had angiographically proven saccular aneurysmal disease and who were free of clinically significant atheromatous disease (as judged by their medical histories and the results of physical examination, electrocardiography, and carotid angiography). The Lp(a) serum levels in these patients were compared with the Lp(a) serum levels in a group of 42 normal healthy controls. Serum Lp(a) levels in the patients was 20.1 +/- 0.42 mg/dl (median +/- standard error); however, median serum Lp(a) in the control subjects was 10.8 +/- 0.47 mg/dl (P < 0.01). Among females, the difference in serum Lp(a) levels was significant; the levels were 22.2 +/- 0.6 for female patients (n = 29) and 9.5 +/- 0.53 in female control subjects (n = 26) (P < 0.005). The most significant difference (P < 0.002) was seen in females < 50 years old (14 patients, 10 control subjects). No significant differences were seen in the Lp(a) serum levels between 21 male patients and 16 male control subjects. Lp(a) levels above the threshold level (30 mg/dl) were found in 20 patients and 7 control subjects (chi 2 = 5.99, P < 0.02); 12 female patients and 3 female control subjects (chi 2 = 6.16, P < 0.02; 8 male patients and 4 male control subjects (this difference was not significant). These results indicate either that cerebrovascular aneurysmal disease and subclinical atherosclerosis are related or that Lp(a) is a risk factor for vasculopathies other than atheroma.
