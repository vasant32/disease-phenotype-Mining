The use of a new examination method -- compressed spectral analysis of EEGs by way of computerized Fourier's transformation -- is described. The method was used for examining 43 patients with cerebral stroke. Real-time comparisons of EEGs and data of their compressed spectral analysis were made in healthy subjects and patients with cerebral strokes of various character. Data on long-time on-line registration of the EEG spectrograms in patients with the cerebral strokes are presented, and the time course of the changes of those spectrograms in patients with the ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke is followed up. Prognostic criteria of the EEG spectrograms in cerebral strokes of various gravity are determined.
