 BACKGROUND: The risk factors for intracranial atherosclerosis are unclear but may differ from those for other stroke subtypes. Here, we investigated whether metabolic syndrome, an emerging risk factor for cardiovascular disease, is associated with intracranial atherosclerotic stroke. METHODS: Using the Adults Treatment Panel III criteria, we evaluated the components of metabolic syndrome in 439 patients with ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attacks. The prevalence of metabolic syndrome within each stroke subtype was determined, and the association between intracranial atherosclerosis and metabolic syndrome was evaluated. RESULTS: Metabolic syndrome was observed more frequently in patients with intracranial atherosclerosis than in those with other types of stroke (P=0.003). In a multiple regression analysis, metabolic syndrome, but not conventional risk factors, was independently associated with intracranial atherosclerosis (P=0.016). By contrast, the serum level of C-reactive protein was correlated negatively with the presence of intracranial atherosclerosis. Intracranial atherosclerosis was most prevalent in patients with metabolic syndrome and low levels of C-reactive protein (P=0.024). CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that metabolic syndrome is a strong independent risk factor for intracranial atherosclerotic stroke. Therefore, treatment of metabolic abnormalities may be an important prevention strategy for intracranial atherosclerotic stroke.
