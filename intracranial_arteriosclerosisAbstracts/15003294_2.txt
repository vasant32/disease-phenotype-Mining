BACKGROUND: Borderzone as well as territorial infarcts can occur in severe atherosclerotic carotid artery disease. It remains controversial whether the borderzone distribution of infarcts is due to hypoperfusion or due to artery-to-artery embolism. PURPOSE: The present study investigates whether cobalt-55 (55Co) positron emission tomography (PET) shows a different pattern of ischaemia according to the topography of the infarct in severe atherosclerotic carotid artery disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Five patients with a cortical borderzone and seven with a territorial infarct, due to symptomatic carotid artery disease, were investigated with 55Co PET 3-6 months after stroke. Average 55Co counts in the infarct area, the adjacent cortical zone, the deep white matter and, contralateral cerebral cortex and white matter, were compared to the values in the cerebellum used as reference. RESULTS: No differences in 55Co ratio were observed in the different regions of interest (ROIs) between patients with cortical borderzone and those with territorial infarcts. The 55Co uptake was similar or lower than the reference value for all ROIs in all individual patients. CONCLUSION: In patients with borderzone as well as with territorial infarcts no evidence was found for subclinical ischaemic injury in or around the infarcts. These data do support the conclusion that cortical borderzone infarcts may not be due to ongoing chronic haemodynamic impairment, but by no means is this conclusive evidence.
