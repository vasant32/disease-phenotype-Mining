Lipid metabolism, which can be an important factor for arteriosclerosis, was studied in the patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage due to ruptured intracranial aneurysm. Total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, triglyceride and Atherogenic Index were determined in 131 patients, who were admitted to our hospital since May, 1984 to March, 1986. Those results were analyzed in relation to the grading on admission, outcome and especially cerebral angiospasm. Serum levels of LDL-cholesterol and Atherogenic Index tended to correlate with the grading on admission. Total cholesterol, Atherogenic Index well correlated with the recovery of the patients and the activity of daily life. In this study, we especially examined the relationship with cerebral angiospasm. The results suggested that the role of cerebral arteriosclerosis caused by disturbance of lipid metabolism was rather negative to the development of cerebral angiospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage.
