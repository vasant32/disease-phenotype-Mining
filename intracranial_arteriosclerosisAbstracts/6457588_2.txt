The binding to plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) of chondroitin sulfate (CS) and heparin sulfate (HS), isolated from cerebral arteries and aortas, was studied. The binding of CS to LDL was higher than that of HS and neither bound to HDL. CS from cerebral arteries contained a higher percentage of iduronic residues (IDUA-Ga1NAc 4S) and a lower percentage of G1cUA-Ga1NAc 4S, and bound more strongly to LDL than CS from aortas. Our results suggest a strong dermatan sulfate (DS) activity on binding to LDL.
