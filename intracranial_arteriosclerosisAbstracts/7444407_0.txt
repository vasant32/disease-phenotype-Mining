Investigation of visual evoked potentials (VEP) by means of checkerboard inversion gives values with good reproducibility and low standard deviation for the latencies and amplitudes of VEP. In patients with scanty symptoms of cerebrovascular disease and without visual field defects, we found either differences of VEP amplitudes from side to another of over 25% (in relation to the larger value) or very small absolute values of the amplitudes (smaller than 3 mu V) as pathological values compared to control subjects. The latencies were normal. The method of investigation described helps towards objective analysis of functional disturbances in patients with cerebrovascular diseases.
