Subcortical arteriosclerotic encephalopathy was diagnosed in a 56-year-old female normotensive patient with gradually progressing dementia, pseudobulbar palsy and motor deficits. CT scan showed white matter low attenuation in the frontal and parietal lobes. Neuropathological examination revealed degeneration of the white matter. Amyloid was found in walls of small cortical vessels. The walls of small vessels in the white matter showed severe thickening, fibrosis and hyalinization but not amyloid. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy may be responsible for subcortical arteriosclerotic encephalopathy.
