A group of clinical senile dementia patients underwent a series of cerebrovascular examinations. Some of them were standard examinations (fundus oculi, electroencephalogram, rheoencephalogram, cerebral angiogram and pneumonencephalogram) while the others were studying regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and modification of flow under fonctional tests (hypercapnia, hypocapnia and intravenous injection of 50 mg chl. papaverine) using the 133Xe clearance technique. The senile dementia group (III) was compared with 'normal' old patients group (I) and with patients suffering from sequelae of a previous stroke or from minor mental disorders (group II). Elderly subjects regarded as 'normal' often present alterations in usual vascular examinations but reveal a relative integrity of cerebral autoregulation. Some patients considered irreversibly 'sclerotic' still have a good grey matter flow (r1CBF) with real vasomotor possibilities. In each of the three groups of elderly subjects, there seemed to be a lack of correlation between the clinical symptoms and certain specific vascular examination.
