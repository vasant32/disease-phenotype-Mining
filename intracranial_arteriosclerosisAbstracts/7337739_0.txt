Delayed appearance of atherosclerotic lesions in cerebral arteries has been observed not only in man but also in monkeys and rabbits submitted to atherogenic diets. Previous observations of ours had shown a Con A positive reaction ("glycocalyx" or "surface coat") at the luminal surface and in the plasmalemmal vesicles of aortic endothelial cells of rabbits an other laboratory animals. The "surface coat" is now reputed the site of lipoproteinlipase activity whose importance in atherogenesis has recently been stressed. In our present observations, the endothelial cells Con A reactivity after Bernhard and Avrameas which was not previously studied in the cerebral arteries of rabbits and monkeys has resulted always lacking in this arterial district. Those observations may help explaining delayed appearance of atherosclerotic lesions in cerebral arteries.
