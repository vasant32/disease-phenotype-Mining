The clinical picture of the extrapyramid disturbances was examined in 52 patients with hypertensive disease and atherosclerosis who had suffered an ischemic cerebral stroke. In 40 cases electromyographic, and in 26 cases pathomorphological examinations were performed. The extrapyramid disturbances are demonstrated with reference to the affection of one or another vascular basin. In ischemic strokes associated with circulatory disorders in the carotid artery basin the following variants of the extrapyramid disturbances were revealed : a) contralateral extrapyramid-pyramid syndrome; b) homolateral extrapyramid syndrome; c) hyperkinetic syndrome. In ischemic strokes due to circulatory disorders in the vertebrobasilar basin the disturbances revealed were: extrapyramid-pyramid-pseudobulbar syndrome (a variant of Filimonov's syndrome) and akinetic rigidity syndrome. The results of the above clinico-physiological examinations were compared with pathoanatomical findings. This comparison has made it possible to expand to a certain extent and concepts about the pathogenetic mechanisms underlying the complicate clinical picture of the extrapyramid disturbances developed in ischemic cerebral stroke.
