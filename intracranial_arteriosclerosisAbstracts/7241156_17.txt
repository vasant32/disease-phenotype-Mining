Subcortical arteriosclerotic encephalopathy (Binswanger's type) was diagnosed in a group of patients with hypertension or arteriosclerosis, who showed acute and subacute neurological deficits, dementia, reduced cerebral blood flow, and white matter low attenuation with mild atrophy and infarcts as the predominant CT scan features. This set of clinical and radiological criteria could be used to make the diagnosis in life, as confirmed neuropathologically in one patient.
