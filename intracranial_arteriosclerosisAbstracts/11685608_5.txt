The distal stump of an occluded intracranial vertebral artery (VA) can mimic a basilar artery aneurysm of the vertebrobasilar junction. Their differentiation is crucial to establishing the appropriate treatment. We report two cases with occlusion of the distal stump of the VA due to atherosclerosis and arterial dissection. Magnetic resonance images with three-dimensional constructive interference in steady state sequences are useful in revealing the occluded segment as a continuous anatomical structure from the proximal VA to the basilar artery. This information may prevent unnecessary exploratory surgery for a suspected basilar artery aneurysm.
