AIM: The study of the detection rate and potential pathogenetic significance of antibodies to low density oxidated lipoprotein (LDOL) in patients who had ischemic cerebral circulation disorder (ICCD) at young age. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The examination (enzyme immunoassay, general and neurological investigations, laboratory and instrumental tests) covered 148 patients who survived ICCD at young age (mean age 37.2 years). RESULTS: 48 of 108 (44%) patients had LDOL antibodies. Antibodies to cardiolipin, lupus anticoagulant were recorded in 33 (31%) patients. LDOL antibodies were higher and occurred more frequently in patients with Sneddon's syndrome (35% of patients, mean LDOL antibodies-44 units) and primary antiphospholipid syndrome (17% of patients, 45 units) than in atherosclerotic affection of the major head arteries (4%, 29 units) or occlusion of cerebral arteries of unclear genesis (8% of patients, 29 units). CONCLUSION: ICCD were not related to fast development of cerebral atherosclerosis or periaortitis due to production of LDOL antibodies as no relationships were found between their rise and atherosclerotic lesions of cerebral major arteries or periaortitis as shown by ultrasonic dopplerography or cerebral angiography. Feasibility of LDOL antibodies participation in the coagulation cascade and induction of hypercoagulatory condition causing ICCD needs special investigation.
