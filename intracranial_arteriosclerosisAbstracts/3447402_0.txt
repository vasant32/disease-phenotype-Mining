On the basis of the results obtained in the examination of 61 patients with atherosclerotic dementia, the author has established general clinical peculiarities of dementia: asthenia, rigidity and the fluctuations in the patients' status. The main types of dementia (general organic, torpid, pseudoparalytic, and amnestic) reflecting the characteristics of cerebrovascular pathology detected by computer tomography of the brain, as well as patterns of the disease (stroke, mixed and stroke-free) have been defined. The main types of structural changes in the patients' brain (foci of lower density, expansion of the CSF spaces and diffuse decrease in the bran density) have been identified. The aggregate of tomographic signs preferable for each type of atherosclerotic dementia and the correlation between the severity of dementia and elicited structural alterations in the brain have been ascertained.
