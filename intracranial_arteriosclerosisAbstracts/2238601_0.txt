The authors studied the indices of general hemodynamics in 53 patients with initial manifestations of cerebro-circulatory insufficiency of young and middle age. Young patients suffering of cerebral atherosclerosis and vegetative-vascular dystonia showed a hyperkinetic type of hemodynamics while the middle-aged with atherosclerosis showed the hypokinetic type evidencing abnormal function of autoregulatory mechanisms.
