By means of ultrasound A-mode echography and Doppler-Kranzb√ºhler sonography new fundamentals of non-invasive qualitative and quantitative classification of cerebrovascular processes could be developed: Apart from usual screening of stenoses and pulse curve analyses, measurements of diameters and wall movements in the extracranial and intracranial carotid artery and in the vertebral artery as well as determinations of the systolic and diastolic flow velocities in the extracranial arteries are outstanding features. By recording and evaluating these parameters and data patterns, coupled with clinical findings, differential conclusions on reactions of the cerebral hemodynamics in macrocirculatory and microcirculatory regions were realized in geriatric patients under the following pathophysiological and therapeutically induced conditions: Generally and regionally accentuated arteriosclerotic lesions of the brain (predominant vertebrobasilar insufficiency), decrease of flow velocities according to the diameter, aggravation by distress; principal possibility of pharmacological influence if myogenic autoregulation function is rehabilitable: It is demonstrated by the example of a long-term therapy with a combination of Raubasine, Dihydroergocristine and DHE (Defluina forte).
