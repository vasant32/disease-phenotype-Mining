We demonstrated that selectively bred homozygous WHHL rabbits known to show hypercholesterolemia and severe coronary atherosclerosis also spontaneously develop cerebral atherosclerosis beginning at 9 months of age. These intracranial lesions occurred in the absence of hypertension in 24 of 25 animals at various sites, mainly along arteries at the base of the brain. No lesions were observed in penetrating arteries. Lesions were rich in smooth muscle cells and fibrous tissue, showing only rare fragmentation or disappearance of the internal elastic lamina, and only limited lipid deposition. Few macrophages were observed in these lesions. No significant correlation was seen between severity of cerebral atherosclerosis and age, systolic blood pressure (BP), serum total cholesterol, or triglyceride concentration. Xanthomas of the pia mater were observed in all 25 rabbits. Arterial findings were similar to those in human cerebral atherosclerosis, indicating that the coronary atherosclerosis-prone homozygous WHHL rabbit represents the first animal model for spontaneous cerebral atherosclerosis.
