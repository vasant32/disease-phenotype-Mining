Ischaemic stroke in young people, that is in those under 45 years of age, forms a distinct entity. Whereas in the case of older patients the main cause is arteriosclerosis, in the younger group a broad spectrum of etiologies can be found. It is for this reason that in these latter cases we must carry out a diagnostic study that is not only more exhaustive but also additionally is aimed at seeking out specific pathologies as for instance a possible association with vasculitis, infectious diseases, hematological abnormalities or unclear cardiopathology. Given the therapeutic transcendency that findings might have, in order to avoid new bouts in patients at the most productive moments in their lives, we believe it to be of great interest to carefully study these patients as exhaustively as need be. In the present work we present the case of a young patient with ischaemic infarct in the region of both upper cerebella which started out with a clinical picture of ataxia and dysarthria with benign course and total recovery. Possible etiologies are discussed in the light of findings made during complementary tests, as well as the unusual location of the lesions.
