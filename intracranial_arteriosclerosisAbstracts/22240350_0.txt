This study was designed to investigate whether the red cell aggregation depends on its initial level under drug therapy or cell incubation with bioactive chemical compounds. Sixty six subjects were enrolled onto this study, and sub-divided into two groups: the first group of patients (n = 36) with cerebral atherosclerosis received pentoxifylline therapy (400 mg, thrice daily) for 4 weeks. The patients of the second group were initially treated with Epoetin beta 10,000 units subcutaneously thrice a week, for 4 weeks. The second group - adult anemic patients (n = 30) with the confirmed diagnosis of solid cancer (Hb < 100 g/L). After 4 weeks of pentoxifylline treatment the red cell aggregation increased (p < 0.05) in the patients with initially low RBCA. On the other hand in the patients with initially high RBCA treatment with pentoxifylline reduced it markedly (p < 0.01). In vitro experiments with pentoxifylline RBC incubation resulted in a decrease of the initially high RBCA by 47% (p < 0.01), whereas in the sub-group with initially low RBCA it increased. It was observed that after 4 weeks of epoetin-beta treatment 75% the anemic patients with initially high RBCA had an aggregation lowering. The drop of aggregation was about 34% (p < 0.01). At the same time 25% of the study patients had a significant RBCA increase (p < 0.05) after treatment. The initially low red cell aggregation after incubation with epoetin-beta was markedly increased by 122% (p < 0.05). On the contrary initially high RBCA was reduced by 47% (p < 0.05). When forskolin (10 Î¼M) was added to the RBC suspensions the RBCA was increased in sub-group of subjects with initially low aggregation and it was decreased in sub-group with initially high one. The similar RBCA changes were observed when RBC suspensions were incubated with vinpocetine, calcium ionophore (A23187), Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) as a protein kinase C (PKC) stimulator. A major finding of this study is that the red cell aggregation effects of some drugs depend markedly on the initial, pre-treatment aggregation status of the patients. These results demonstrate that the different red blood cell aggregation responses to the biological stimuli depend strongly on the initial, pre-treatment status of the subject and the most probably it is connected with the crosstalk between the adenylyl cyclase signaling pathway and Ca2+ regulatory mechanism.
