A 17-year-old girl died from the rupture of a large fusiform aneurysm of the terminal internal carotid artery. Autopsy revealed three other fusiform aneurysms originating from major cerebral arteries clearly within the ports of previously administered telecobalt radiation therapy. Five years prior to her death, a suprasellar germinoma was partially removed and the area was treated by radiation therapy via three ports. The original arteriograms showed a normal vascular tree. Repeat arteriograms, 3 years and 8 months before her death, demonstrated the aneurysms. The development of aneurysms following radiation damage of the arteries has been reported previously, but not in intracranial vessels.
