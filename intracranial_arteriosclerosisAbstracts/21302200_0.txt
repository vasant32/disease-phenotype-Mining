 INTRODUCTION: Until recently, the treatment of intracranial atherosclerosis has remained limited. Due to advances in endovascular technology and technique, angioplasty and stenting has become an accepted treatment for medically-refractory intracranial atherosclerosis. Patients with intracranial atherosclerosis frequently have multiple lesions, however, the clinical significance of each individual lesion is not always evident. In these instances the treating physician must decide which lesions should be managed conservatively, and which should be treated. TECHNIQUE: Emphasizing decision-making, we describe a patient in whom 3 separate atherosclerotic lesions in the same vascular territory underwent endovascular treatment in one treatment session. Each of the lesions was treated with angioplasty and stent placement. CONCLUSION: This may be a relatively safe and efficacious technique that allows for the treatment of multiple lesions without the risks associated with multiple cerebral angiograms.
