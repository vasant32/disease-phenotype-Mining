30 micromalformations (MMF) of brain vessels that were not diagnosed either clinically or at the autopsy were found histologically in 25 autopsy cases and in 3 patients after the surgical operation. MMF were, in half of the cases, the cause of the stroke which was mistakingly considered a complication of the arterial hypertension, cerebral atherosclerosis or rupture of saccular aneurysm of the brain base arteries. Clinically, MMF were either latent or manifested as recurrent disturbances of the brain circulation of the ischemic or (more frequently) haemorrhagic type. When clinically manifested MMF were revealed at the age of 15-32 years; at the age of 65-74 years they were found incidentally at the autopsy. Their predominant localization was in the brain stem, contiguous ventricular wall and in the cerebellum with its tunic. The following histological types can be distinguished: telangiectasia, venous, cavernous, arteriovenous, nonclassified, varicosis. Clinico-anatomical characterization of each type is presented. The medico-legal importance of MMF and the principal possibility of their treatment (when duly diagnosed) is pointed out.
