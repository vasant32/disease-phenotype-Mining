Total glycosilated haemoglobin (HbA1) concentration, serum triglyceride and cholesterol levels were measured in 55 arterio sclerotic patients classified in three groups: (A) normal, (B) borderline and (C) chemical diabetics according to their OGTT results. HbA1 values were high only in group C. In these patients the HbA1 concentrations correlated to the serum glucose peaks and serum triglyceride levels. Therefore we believe that the HbA1 concentration can be considered an index of the degree of carbohydrate imbalance in arteriosclerotic patients who frequently have high triglyceride levels and carbohydrate intolerance.
