The author describes the physiological relations that emerge on an analysis of the effects of thermal pulsation on the nasolabile area, as well as those between functional systems of thermoregulation, on the one hand, and respiration, vascular tone and sleep control mechanisms, on the other one. Analyzes complex physiological shifts occurring during the procedures of thermal pulsation and the essence of their multivariate clinical significance.
