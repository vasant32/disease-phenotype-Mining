Ultrasonography is the most innocuous and noninvasive procedure, ideally suited for screening patients suspected of having cerebrovascular insufficiency. The Doppler ultrasound and real-time techniques complement each other. The latter can actually display a two-dimensional dynamic image of the carotid artery. B-scan can also be used in fetuses, infants, and young children for precise assessment of the size of the ventricular system. It can be used for serial follow-up evaluation of hydrocephalus. Ultrasound can be utilized in determination of the depth and width of the lumbar spinal canal. Differentiation of cystic from solid masses in the spinal canal may also be made by this modality.
