Presented herein is an analysis of surgical treatment of 232 patients with atherosclerotic stenoses and occlusions of the carotid arteries, including 144 persons with bilateral lesions. The patients underwent carotid endarterectomy according to the traditional and eversion techniques. Analysis of the short- and long-term results has demonstrated that they do not depend on the technique of endarterectomy. The risk of carotid endarterectomy rises in occlusions of the contralateral internal carotid artery. The measures for this risk minimization are offered. The long-term results of surgical treatment of asymptomatic stenoses are better as compared to the results of drug therapy. Surgical treatment of atherosclerotic lesions followed by the treatment of lipid metabolism disorders provides for the improvement of the quality of life due to the restoration of work fitness, physical and social activity.
