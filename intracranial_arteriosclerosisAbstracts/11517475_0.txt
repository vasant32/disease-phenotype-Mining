The data about the role of blood flow in atherosclerosis development were examined. The aim of the study was determination of hydrodynamic blood resistance and Toms effect in patients with ischemic disorders of cerebral circulation in different periods of the disease. 45 patients with atherosclerotic damages of major arteries of head were observed. Such damages were combined with arterial hypertension in 32 individuals. The value of hematocrit, asymptotic viscosity, hydrodynamic resistance and Toms' effect were determined in blood as well as levels of cholesterol, beta-lipoproteins and platelets. The presence of Toms' effect was found in blood samples of both patients and controls. There was a significant increase of hydrodynamic blood resistance in all the patients as compared to control group. The patients with ischemic disorders of cerebral circulation were compensated by their own blood factor in less degree in acutest and acute periods than later. Low values of Toms' effect in separate patients were prognostic sings for good restoration of neurologic functions; higher values were observed in patients with arterial hypertension. The conclusion was made that hemodynamic properties of blood flow may be considered as predictors of the severity of the course of cerebral circulation disorders.
