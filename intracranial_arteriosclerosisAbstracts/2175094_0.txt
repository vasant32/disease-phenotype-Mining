Altogether 94 patients with initial manifestations of brain blood supply failure (IMBBSF) consequent on vegetative vascular dystonia and atherosclerosis of the cerebral vessels were examined. Clinical, echopulsographic and dopplerographic examinations demonstrated that 54 patients had cerebral venous discirculation. The main diagnostic criteria for cerebral venous discirculation in patients with IMBBSF lie in an increase of the configuration of the diastolic part of the echoPG of the cerebral arteries, possibility of recording echoPG of the cerebral veins, a rise of the linear velocity of the blood flow in the jugular veins under head-down test during dopplerography.
