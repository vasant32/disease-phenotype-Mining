Vascular brain diseases are ranked the third as the cause of morbidity and mortality, in spite of the progress in diagnostic, therapeutic and preventive procedures. In the majority of cases of vascular brain diseases, it is ischemic brain disease, which is the final and the most severe stage of cerebral arteries atherosclerosis. Etiopathogenesis of atherosclerosis is not closer defined yet, but oxidative hypothesis is distinguished among the numerous theories. Within this theory, main place is attached to oxidative modification of LDL and Lp(a), together with numerous physiopathologic facts with the central role of reactive oxidative matters, where endothelial dysfunction is the main disorder responsible for the onset of numerous impairments, such as changes in coagulation-anticoagulation system. Considering these facts, it was established the hypothesis that in patients with IBD existed changes in hemostatic system, which were in positive correlation with the degree of cerebral atherosclerosis. The study comprised 36 patients with acute IBD and 28 patients with atherosclerotic encephalopathy. Control group was comprised of 30 patients with non-vascular diseases of similar characteristics. We investigated the correlation of the changes in hemostatic system (platelet aggregation, anti-thrombin III, D-dimer, protein C, factor VII, factor VIII, PAI-1) compared to the degree of cerebral atherosclerosis (ultrasonographically) and compared to the observed groups of patients. On the basis of all, the results of this study revealed significant increase of procoagulant factors concentration in patients with IBD, and similar changes were observed in patients with atherosclerotic encephalopathy, but less pronounced. All these changes in the total sample of patients, and particularly in patients with the pronounced cerebral atherosclerosis, are of primary and chronic character.
