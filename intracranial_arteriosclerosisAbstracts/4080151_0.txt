Carotid endarterectomy is the procedure most commonly used for the treatment of lesions in the internal carotid artery. It is occasionally also necessary to insert an internal shunt. After surgery, the patient should be kept in intensive care for 24 h. The most serious complication that can occur is a neurological deficit. Endarterectomy of the origin of the vertebral artery is also the most common procedure used at this location. The techniques for treatment of lesions in the supra-aortic trunks are also discussed, as are the procedures used in cerebral revascularization by extra-intracranial anastomosis.
