A non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy has usually a poor prognosis. Spontaneous remissions are extremely rare. In contrast to arteritic anterior ischemic neuropathy, systemic corticosteroids are generally accepted to be ineffective. Two cases of bilateral severe non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy are reported who underwent full remission of their visual function directly related to high-dose systemic corticosteroids. It is hypothesized that, in acute phases of non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy a significant reduction of tissue swelling and consecutive prelaminar reperfusion can be achieved with high-dose corticosteroids.
