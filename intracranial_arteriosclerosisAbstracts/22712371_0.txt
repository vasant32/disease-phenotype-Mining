 OBJECTIVE: To explore the clinical screening and value of vertebral artery ultrasound, Transcranial doppler (TCD), Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and Computed tomography angiography (CTA) in the diagnosis of cerebral arteriosclerosis combined with vertebral artery abnormalies according to vertebral artery digital subtraction angiography (DSA). METHODS: From January 2006 to September 2010, 186 patients with cerebral arteriosclerosis were retrospectively analyzed. Among the patients, 133 cases were males and 53 cases were females,ranged from 30 to 84 years (with a mean of 63.8 years). All the patients were estimated by DSA; 172 cases were estimated vertebral artery ultrasound and TCD; 53 cases were estimated by MRA; 25 cases were estimated by CTA. The positive results by DSA were seen as case group, while the negative results were seen as control group. The sensitivity, specificity and concordance rate among four groups were calculated. RESULTS: The abnormality rate of vertebral artery with DSA, vertebral artery ultrasound, TCD, MRA and CTA separately was 50.00% (93/186), 30.81% (53/172), 49.42% (85/172),15.10% (8/53) and 40.00% (10/25). According to DSA standard, the sensitivity of vertebral artery ultrasound in diagnosing was 50.57%, the specificity was 89.41%, and concordance rate was 69.77%; while the sensitivity of TCD was 68.48%, the specificity was 72.50%, and concordance rate was 70.35%; the sensitivity of MRA was 21.43%, specificity was 92.00%, and concordance rate was 54.72%; the sensitivity of CTA was 63.64%,the specificity was 78.57%, and concordance rate was 72.00%. CONCLUSION: The reasonable and combined application of vertebral artery ultrasound, TCD, MRA and CTA is helpful for diagnosing cerebral arteriosclerosis combined with vertebral artery abnormalies. For the patients with cerebrovascular disease, cervical massage technique should be paid highly attention, which may cause vertebral artery injury and other complications.
