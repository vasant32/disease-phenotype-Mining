The hypotensive drug alphamethyldopa, an inhibitor of serotonin synthesis, caused significant hypothermia ranging from 33.4 to 34.8 degrees C (t=3.09 at P less than 0.05) in four out of nine hypertensive patients, with evidence of cerebral atherosclerosis. The anti-serotonin effect of alphamethyldopa correlated with statistically significant (t=6.8 at P less than 0.001) fall in the 24 hour urinary 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid on the third day of the therapy. The possible mode of hypothermic side effect is discussed.
