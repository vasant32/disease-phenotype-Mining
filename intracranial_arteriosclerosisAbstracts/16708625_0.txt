Atherosclerosis is a complex dynamic pathological problem. Apart from classic risk factors of atherosclerosis development (age, gender, arterial hypertension, elevated cholesterol concentration particularly LDL fraction, cigarette smoking, diabetes, hyperhomocysteinemia, low physical activity, obesity, mental stress), infectious-inflammatory factors play an important role in the onset of atherosclerotic changes. Vascular endothelium is the main target organ of their activity. Basing on recent literature the study presents pathomechanisms of the development of endothelial dysfunction caused by the risk factors of atherosclerosis, particularly by infectious-inflammatory factors and their mutual interactions which lead to the development of stable and unstable atheromatous plaque.
