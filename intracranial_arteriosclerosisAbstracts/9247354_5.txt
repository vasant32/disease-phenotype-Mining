Composition of heparan sulfate (HS) isomers from unaffected and atherosclerotic cerebral arteries (isolated by autopsy) of Japanese women, of various ages, was studied. HS isomers were separated as disaccharide units by high-performance liquid chromatography after degeneration with HS and heparin lyases. Heparitinase facilitated differentiation of eight unsaturated disaccharides (deltaDi-S(HS)) of vascular HS isomers. The HS isomers in the cerebral arteries consisted of approximately half the total glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). Both HS (and GAGs) tended to increase with the processes of aging but decreased with the advancing development of atherosclerosis. The HS isomers consisted of a higher proportion of non-sulfated disaccharide, about 2/3 of the total HS, followed by mono-sulfated and bis-sulfated saccharides; in addition, heparin existed, albeit in minute amounts. The proportion of deltaDi-S(HS) rich in sulfate compared with HS isomers tended to increase with aging but most decreased during formation of the atheroma. Putative functions of HS isomers in cerebral arteries are discussed, based on the characteristic distribution of HS components.
