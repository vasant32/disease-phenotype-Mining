The article deals with analysing the outcomes following surgical management of one hundred and six patients presenting with lesions of the renal arteries. Twenty-eight (25.4%) of the 106 patients operated on for lesions of the renal arteries were found to have a concomitant lesion of the aortic arch branches. Also suggested herein is a method aimed at determining the staging of reconstructive operations on the aortic arch branches and renal arteries, which is based upon the authors' own technique specifically devised for quantitative assessment of tolerance of the brain to ischaemia, i. e., determining the autoregulatory reaction of the cerebral vessels. This would make it possible to determine the sequence of reconstructive interventions to perform on the aortic arch branches and renal arteries, and hence dramatically diminish the rate of postoperative cerebrovascular complications.
