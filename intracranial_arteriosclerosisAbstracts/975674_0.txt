This review has highlighted some of the factors which influence the formation and fate of thrombi. Rheology and flow, the coagulation mechanism, the fibrinolytic enzyme system, and the properties of platelets to adhere and aggregate all play a significant role. Of paramount importance to neurosurgeons is the role of the vascular wall in thrombogenesis. The ulcerated atherosclerotic plaque demonstrates this point. Factors contributing to thromboembolism in this setting include stenosis and reduced flow, turbulence, and the elements in the lesion with which blood interacts. These are principally collagen, ADP, fatty acids, and the thromboplastic activity of vascular subendothelial tissue. Current concepts of the etiologies of atherosclerosis were discussed. Along with other predisposing factors, platelets may play a significant role in the initiation of the process. The current status of clinical trials with inhibitors of platelet function in the treatment of cerebrovascular disorders was reviewed. In vascular reconstructive surgery, the principles which underlie good technique are those which best insure against thrombosis. The briefest possible period of stasis during surgery should be maintained. The reconstruction should result in a smooth blood flow pattern with rapid runoff and minimal stenosis or gaps between apposed endothelial surfaces.
