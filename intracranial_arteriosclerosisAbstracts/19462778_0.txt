Object of investigation was types of personality of civil pilots. The investigation involved healthy pilots (n = 58, controls) and pilots afflicted with cerebral atherosclerosis (n = 67) including pilots with atherosclerotic plaques (n = 23). The personality questionnaire developed by L.N. Sobchik was used. The investigation showed that signs of personality accentuation in pilots with cerebral atherosclerosis were largely manifested by distortion of individual psychological attributes. This finding may be helpful to members of the medical flight certification board in making prognosis of pilot's health and professional longevity.
