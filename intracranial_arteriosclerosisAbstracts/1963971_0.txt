Piracetam was applied to the treatment of 60 patients with the initial manifestations of brain blood supply failure and stage I encephalopathy associated with circulatory disorders. Echopulsography of the intracranial vessels and dopplerography of the extracranial vessels of the brain were employed, changes in lipid metabolism, rheological and coagulation properties of the blood were defined. Continuous use of piracetam per os was found to produce a number of beneficial therapeutic effects. Some patients suffering from encephalopathy associated with circulatory disorders showed headache enhancement after intake of 1.6 g of the drug, accompanied by a considerable increase of the amplitude of pulse fluctuations, prompting the reduction of the drug dose. Piracetam decreased the high vascular resistance and raised the lowered volume of pulse fluctuations. In all the patients examined, aggregation of formed elements of the blood returned to normal whereas the content of atherogenic lipids in blood serum significantly dropped.
