Saphenous vein patch angioplasty has been used to improve the results of carotid endarterectomy by decreasing the incidence of postoperative occlusion and recurrent stenosis. A rare but potentially lethal complication of this technique is aseptic necrosis and rupture of the vein patch during the postoperative period. We report three cases of this phenomenon and review an additional 13 cases from the literature. This event generally occurs without warning 2 to 7 days postoperatively and may result in death or stroke. At reoperation, the central portion of the vein patch is necrotic, without evidence of infection. Technical considerations in the harvesting and preparation of these grafts are reviewed, as are the physical parameters predisposing certain vein patches to rupture. Saphenous vein harvested from the ankle has been linked to every reported case. Small diameter veins in particular appear to carry a higher risk of rupture.
