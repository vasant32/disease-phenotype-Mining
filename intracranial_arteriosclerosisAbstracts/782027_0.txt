A new mathematical method is suggested for making the prognosis of the results of surgery for haemorrhagic strokes due to essential hypertension and atherosclerosis. Twenty-two signs characterizing the patient's state are fed into the computer trained on the basis of 124 case reports of patients, both surviving and dying after surgery. The computer operating in accordance with the "Kopa-3" programme works out a vital prognosis for both the medicamental and surgical treatment. The prognosis proved correct in 90% of the cases. The described method permits an objective determination of the indications for surgery in hemorrhagic stroke.
