The cerebral blood flow time (CBFT) was examined in 100 patients with brain circulatory disorders with the aid of radiocirculography (RCG). Use was made of 99mCc-pertechnetate (37 MBq) and a two-channel "Gamma" radiograph manufactured in the Hungarian Republic. The rate of film movement amounts to 160 mm/min at the time constant 10. The time of 5.5-7.5 s is assumed as normal CBFT. On recording the arterial and venous phases one can see different alterations in RCG, which primarily manifest themselves in the form of cerebral blood flow deceleration (ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes, cerebral atherosclerosis, brain tumors) and in the shortening of the CBFT in patients with arteriovenous aneurysms.
