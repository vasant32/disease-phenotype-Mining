A 54-year-old male patient is reported in whom progression of clinical manifestations, neurological signs and results of ancillary investigations suggested a cerebellopontine angle tumour in the initial stage of the disease. Further observation and additional appearance after 10 months of signs evidencing damage to other brain-stem structures made possible the diagnosis of a vascular aetiology of the pathological process.
