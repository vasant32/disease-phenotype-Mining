The present study examined the effect of high fat and high fructose (HFF) diet on the development of atherosclerosis and vascular contractile responses in the cerebral artery and thoracic aorta in non-human primates. Female cynomolgus monkeys (age: 3 to 4 years) were divided into normal control diet (N=5) and HFF diet groups (N=5). Twenty-eight weeks after feeding the HFF diet, total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol in serum were significantly increased in the HFF diet group compared to the control group. The ultrastructural analyses of the basilar artery and aorta demonstrated the infiltration of lipid-laden foam cells and the appearance of lipid droplet-filled smooth muscle cells in the monkeys fed with the HFF diet. In terms of vascular reactivity, there was significantly greater vasoconstriction of the aorta and basilar artery in response to 5-hydroxytryptamine in the HFF diet group compared to the normal diet-fed group. In addition, KCl-induced vasoconstriction of the basilar arteries was also significantly enhanced in the HFF diet group compared to the normal diet-fed monkeys. In all, our present study has demonstrated that changes in the vascular responsiveness of the cerebral artery and its cellular architecture may manifest into cerebrovascular complications consistent with a pathological state normally observed with the onset and progression of atherosclerosis.
