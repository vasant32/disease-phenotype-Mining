Severe dyslipidemia and the associated oxidative stress could accelerate the age-related decline in cerebrovascular endothelial function and cerebral blood flow (CBF), leading to neuronal loss and impaired learning abilities. We hypothesized that a chronic treatment with the polyphenol catechin would prevent endothelial dysfunction, maintain CBF responses, and protect learning abilities in atherosclerotic (ATX) mice. We treated ATX (C57Bl/6-LDLR(-/-)hApoB(+/+); 3 mo old) mice with catechin (30 mg · kg(-1) · day(-1)) for 3 mo, and C57Bl/6 [wild type (WT), 3 and 6 mo old] mice were used as controls. ACh- and flow-mediated dilations (FMD) were recorded in pressurized cerebral arteries. Basal CBF and increases in CBF induced by whisker stimulation were measured by optical coherence tomography and Doppler, respectively. Learning capacities were evaluated with the Morris water maze test. Compared with 6-mo-old WT mice, cerebral arteries from 6-mo-old ATX mice displayed a higher myogenic tone, lower responses to ACh and FMD, and were insensitive to NOS inhibition (P < 0.05), suggesting endothelial dysfunction. Basal and increases in CBF were lower in 6-mo-old ATX than WT mice (P < 0.05). A decline in the learning capabilities was also observed in ATX mice (P < 0.05). Catechin 1) reduced cerebral superoxide staining (P < 0.05) in ATX mice, 2) restored endothelial function by reducing myogenic tone, improving ACh- and FMD and restoring the sensitivity to nitric oxide synthase inhibition (P < 0.05), 3) increased the changes in CBF during stimulation but not basal CBF, and 4) prevented the decline in learning abilities (P < 0.05). In conclusion, catechin treatment of ATX mice prevents cerebrovascular dysfunctions and the associated decline in learning capacities.
