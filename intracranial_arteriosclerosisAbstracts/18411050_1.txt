In this hospital-based cross-sectional study we investigated differences in the levels of serum atherosclerotic and fibrinolytic markers and the prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MS) among patients with four subtypes of cerebral infarctions. Blood samples were taken from 171 cerebral infarction inpatients to determine the levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, serum total homocysteine, serum plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 and lipoprotein a. Subjects were also screened for MS. Atherothrombotic infarction was most prevalent, followed by lacunar and embolic infarction. The median length of hospital stay was longest for embolic infarcts. There were no statistically significant differences in serum marker concentrations. The proportion of MS varied significantly among the subtypes, and was highest among patients with embolic infarctions with the lowest high density cholesterol levels. MS was most prevalent among patients having undergone embolic events that are reported to have the worst prognoses. Further epidemiologic studies are needed to better understand the characteristics and differences in the etiology of cerebral infarction subtypes.
