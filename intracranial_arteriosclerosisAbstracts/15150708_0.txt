INTRODUCTION: To describe vascular risk factors of patients harboring intracranial arterial stenosis (IAS) as well their final outcome. METHODS: We reviewed clinical reports of all patients admitted to our Institution from April 1, 1999 to November 30, 2001 with the diagnosis of IAS. Diagnosis was made by means of magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) or four-vessels digital subtraction angiography. Thirty-eight patients harboring 56 IAS were identified. Mean follow-up was 18 months. Two control groups were selected: one was a group of 44 patients with stroke and embolic cardiopathy (EC) and the other was a group of 67 patients with stroke and extracranial stenosis without IAS. RESULTS: Mean age was 69.7 years, with male preponderance (76.3 %). Seventeen cases (44.7 %) had associated extracranial carotid stenosis greater than 50 %. Multiple IAS were found in 12 patients. Diabetes mellitus was significantly more frequent in the IAS group than in both control groups. On the other hand, cigarette smoking was more common in the IAS group with respect to the EC group. IAS was symptomatic in 25 cases, whereas in 13 patients IAS was found in the work-up for cerebral ischemia in another territory. From the group of symptomatic patients, 22 (88 %) had a Rankin scale 2 or lower on discharge and, in the long term follow-up, their incidence rate of recurrent ischemic stroke was 15 per 100 patients/year. CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes mellitus was the most specific risk factor for IAS. IAS was multiple in 32% of patients and in extracranial stenosis from moderate to severe degree was found in 44.7% of the cases. Stroke secondary to IAS caused a low dependency level at discharge. Incidence rate of recurrent ischemic stroke was 15 % patients/ year.
