Fifty-three patients with infarction of the corona radiata adjacent to the body of the lateral ventricle were clinically evaluated in order to determine the clinical characteristics of this infarction and localization of the pyramidal tract in this area, as well as its somatotopy and etiology. Clinical characteristics included the following: (1) this type of infarction was observed in 9.1% of all patients with cerebral infarction; (2) although 81.1% of the patients of this type had clear consciousness and neuropsychological symptoms in some patients; (3) motor paralysis usually occurred in the upper limbs; (4) monoplegia occurred in 13.2% of patients, with monoplegia of upper and lower limbs being associated with infarction of the anterior and posterior portion, respectively, of the corona radiata adjacent to the body of the lateral ventricle; (5) pure motor hemiplegia was observed in 45.3% of patients; (6) facial paralysis and dysarthria were observed in 54.7% and 58.5% of patients, respectively, and the incidence of these symptoms was the highest in the infarction of the anterior portion of the corona radiata; (7) sensory disturbance, which was usually recognized as a mild subjective feeling of abnormality and localized to the limbs, was reported by 47.2% of patients; (8) risk factors included hypertension, diabetes and high hematocrit and triglyceride levels; (9) arteriosclerosis was often noted in areas between the siphon of the internal carotid artery and the main stem of the anterior and middle cerebral arteries; (10) 64.2% of patients were able to conduct independent activities of daily life (ADL) 1 month after the onset of the disease and more marked paralysis remained in the infarction of the middle portion than in the anterior or posterior portion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
