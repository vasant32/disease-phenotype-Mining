 BACKGROUND: Various biomarkers are linked with the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis. We hypothesized that these factors may be associated with the location and burden of cerebral atherosclerosis. METHODS: We evaluated 177 consecutive patients with chronic (>6 months) ischemic stroke: 68 with small vessel occlusion (SVO) and 109 with large-artery atherosclerosis (LAA), with the latter further sub-classified into 80 patients with intracranial atherosclerosis (ICAS) and 29 with extracranial atherosclerosis (ECAS). The number of ≥50% steno-occlusions on magnetic resonance angiography was used to assess the burden of atherosclerosis. Serum concentrations of the biomarkers (matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-2 and -9, homocysteine, interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, C-reactive protein, adiponectin, leptin, resistin, free fatty acid, and lipoprotein(a)) and the metabolic syndrome were measured in each study subject. RESULTS: Decreased plasma concentrations of MMP-2 (p = 0.020) and homocysteine (p = 0.038) were more closely associated with ICAS than with ECAS, whereas increased IL-6 concentrations were related to severe (≥4 steno-occlusions) atherosclerosis (p = 0.031). Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that the lowest tertile of MMP-2 was independently associated with ICAS (OR 4.84, 95% CI 1.29-18.19, p = 0.022). CONCLUSION: Low MMP-2 plasma levels are associated with intracranial location of cerebral atherosclerosis, suggesting that MMP-2 may play a role in the development of ICAS.
