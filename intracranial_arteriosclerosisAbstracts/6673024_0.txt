Red blood cell filterability, platelet aggregation and blood fibrinogen levels were evaluated in 46 vasculopathic patients with a history of peripheral insufficiency (15 subjects), cerebral insufficiency (16 subjects) and coronary insufficiency (15 subjects). In comparison with a control group of 24 normal subjects, filterability was depressed, platelet aggregation was enhanced and there was a higher plasma concentration of fibrinogen even one month after the last clinical episode of acute ischemia.
