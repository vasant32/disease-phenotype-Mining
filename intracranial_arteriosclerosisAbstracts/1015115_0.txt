For the treatment of 42 patients with different forms of atherosclerotic and postencephalitic parkinsonism the author used levopa drugs, medantane, cyclodol and parkopan in combination and separately. The most stable improvement was obtained from a combination of levopa with cyclodol in patient with rigid-akynetic-trembling manifestations of parkinsonism. The treatment by medantane increased the therapeutical effect in the patients with postencephalitic parkinsonism. Methyl-dopa and pyridoxine served as a corrector of levopa. The studies on the blood content of acetylcholine and cholinesterase showed a growth of cholinolytic and cholinesterase activity in the blood.
