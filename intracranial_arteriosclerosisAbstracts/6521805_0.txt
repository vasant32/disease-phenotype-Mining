33 patients with transient global amnesia were examined by cerebral angiography. The presence of arterial lesions correlated with neurological symptoms, as well as with amnesia. In 55% of cases no pathological alterations were found, so that the pathogenesis of the transient global amnesia remained unclear. For clinical purposes, cerebral angiography is recommended only in those cases which show other neurological symptoms besides the transient global amnesia.
