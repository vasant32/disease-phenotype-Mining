Progressive pure motor hemiparesis is a common feature in paramedian pontine infarction. To assess the etiology, clinical course and long-term prognosis of this stroke subtype, we identified 26 patients with progressive symptoms in a retrospective study, treated in our hospital between 1993 and 1998. All patients had more than one stroke risk factor, and in 20, basilar branch disease, an atherosclerotic occlusion of basilar perforating arteries, was causative. Most patients developed severe hemiparesis after a mean time of 3 days, nearly 50% showed deterioration in connection with a fall in systolic blood pressure. The patients were followed up for 4-9 years: 4 patients had further strokes, 5 died, and 17 patients were independent, which may be interpreted as a good long-term prognosis.
