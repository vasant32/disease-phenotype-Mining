<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, Literature about the effect of childbirth on <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> is limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study examined the effect of childbirth on the course of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and especially perianal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study which was performed in a tertiary level referral hospital in the Netherlands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>From the IBD database, female patients aged 18-80 years in 2004 were selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Data analysis took place in the years 2005 and 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eventually, 114 women with at least one pregnancy after the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> were eligible for the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Differences between groups were analyzed using Wilcoxon Mann Whitney tests and Chi-square analysis with 2 × 2 or 2 × 3 contingency tables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two-tailed values were used and p values &lt; 0.05 were considered statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 21/114 women (18%) had active <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> disease prior to pregnancy, with significantly more pregnancy related complications compared to women with inactive <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> disease (Odds ratio 2.8; 95% CI 1.0 - 7.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Caesarean section rate was relatively high (37/114, 32%), especially in patients with perianal disease prior to pregnancy compared to women without perianal disease (Odds ratio 4.6; 95% CI 1.8 - 11.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Disease progression after childbirth was more frequent in patients with active <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> disease prior to pregnancy compared to inactive <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> disease (Odds ratio 9.7; 95% CI 2.1 - 44.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Progression of perianal disease seems less frequent after vaginal delivery compared with caesarean section, in both women with prior perianal disease (18% vs. 31%, NS) and without prior perianal disease (5% vs 14%, NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There were no more <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath>-related complications after childbirth in women with an episiotomy or second degree tear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A relatively high rate of caesarean sections was observed in women with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo>, especially in women with perianal disease prior to pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>A protective effect of caesarean section on progression of perianal disease was not observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>However, this must be interpreted carefully due to confounder effect by indication for caesarean section </plain></SENT>
