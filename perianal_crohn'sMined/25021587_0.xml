<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: It is widely accepted that <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>Ulcerative Colitis</z:hpo> (UC) is a mucosal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1290884" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory disease</z:e> confined to the colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Bolder disease definitions coupled with novel and evolving imaging paradigms have led to more sophisticated small bowel imaging in recent years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Despite this, studies on the relevance and yield of small bowel pathology in UC patients are limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of consecutive UC patients seen at our institution between May-October 2013 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical data for demographics, disease characteristics, small bowel investigation, endoscopy, treatment and clinical outcomes were obtained from electronic patient records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We analysed 321 patients with biopsy confirmed UC [61% male, mean age 53 yrs, range 18-91 yrs] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean age of diagnosis was 43 yrs and mean disease duration was 10 yrs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Montreal classification was E1 (14%), E2 (49%) and E3 (37%) respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Forty-seven patients had small bowel investigations: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> enterography in 81%, CT enterography in 15% and <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32594,32595">barium</z:chebi> follow-through in 4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Disease severity at the time of small bowel imaging was mild to moderate in 68% and 32% had severe disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thirty-two percent of patients were on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35666">thiopurines</z:chebi>, 19% on bimodal immunosuppression (infliximab + <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35666">thiopurine</z:chebi>) and 49% were on aminosalicylates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Seven patients had undergone colectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Small bowel imaging was reported <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in 46/47 and one patient had distal and terminal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0020875" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ileal disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Indications for small bowel imaging are shown in Table 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Subsequent to small bowel imaging, 40% (19/47) had no change in therapy, 43% were escalated to immunosuppressive therapy and 11% underwent surgery for UC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In 3 patients, the diagnosis was changed from UC to <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (2 with perianal Crohn's; 1 with small bowel Crohn's based on MRE) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subsequently treated with Anti-TNF therapy. gutjnl;63/Suppl_1/A168-b/T1T1T1 Abstract PWE-101 Table 1 Context of small bowel imaging in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (n = 47) Context n (%) At the time of disease diagnosis (1st episode; equivocal histology) 7 (15%) Prior to therapy escalation 17 (36%) Gastrointestinal symptoms atypical for UC 9 (19%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>Abdominal pain</z:hpo> (post-colectomy) 7 (15%) Persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> 7 (15%) CONCLUSION: The yield of small bowel pathology in our cohort was low, supporting current European Crohn's and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>Colitis</z:hpo> Organisation (ECCO) recommendations.(1) Small bowel imaging in UC meanwhile should be considered in the well-selected patient and driven by the clinical question or diagnostic uncertainty </plain></SENT>
