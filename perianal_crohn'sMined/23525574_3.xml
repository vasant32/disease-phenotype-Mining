<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess whether a combination of adalimumab and ciprofloxacin is superior to adalimumab alone in the treatment of perianal fistulising <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled trial in eight Dutch hospitals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In total, 76 CD patients with active perianal fistulising disease were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After adalimumab induction therapy (160/80 mg week 0, 2), patients received 40 mg every other week together with ciprofloxacin 500 mg or placebo twice daily for 12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 12 weeks, adalimumab was continued </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Follow-up was 24 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Primary endpoint (clinical response) was defined as 50% reduction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistulas</z:mpath> from baseline to week 12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Secondary endpoints included remission (closure of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistulas</z:mpath>), Perianal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's Disease</z:hpo> Activity Index, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's Disease</z:hpo> Activity Index (CDAI) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Inflammatory Bowel Disease</z:e> Questionnaire (IBDQ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Clinical response was observed in 71% of patients treated with adalimumab plus ciprofloxacin and in 47% treated with adalimumab plus placebo (p=0.047) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Likewise, remission rate at week 12 was significantly higher (p=0.009) in the combination group (65%) compared with adalimumab plus placebo (33%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Combination treatment was associated with a higher mean CDAI change and mean IBDQ change at week 12 (p=0.005 and p=0.009, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At week 24, no difference in clinical response between the two treatment groups was observed (p=0.22) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No difference in safety issues was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Combination therapy of adalimumab and ciprofloxacin is more effective than adalimumab monotherapy to achieve <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> closure in CD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>However, after discontinuation of antibiotic therapy, the beneficial effect of initial coadministration is not maintained </plain></SENT>
