<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To assess the long-term efficacy of seton drainage with infliximab maintenance therapy in treatment of stricture for perianal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> (CD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty-two patients with perianal CD who required surgical treatment with or without infliximab between September 2000 and April 2010 were identified from our clinic's database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The activities of the perianal lesions were evaluated using the modified perianal CD activity index (mPDAI) score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was a clinical response at 12-15 wk after surgery as a short-term efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Secondary endpoints were recurrence as reflected in the mPDAI score, defined as increased points in every major element </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The clinical responses were classified as completely healed (mPDAI = 0), partially improved (mPDAI score decreased more than 4 points), and failure or recurrence (mPDAI score increased or decreased less than 3 points) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 43 males and 19 females, of whom 26 were consecutively treated with infliximab after surgery as maintenance therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Complete healing was not seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Failure was seen in 10/36 (27.8%) patients without infliximab and 4/26 (15.4%) patients with infliximab (P = 0.25) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Partial improvement was seen in 26/36 (72.2%) patients without infliximab and 22/26 (88.5%) patients with infliximab (P = 0.25) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Short-term improvement was achieved in 48/62 (77.4%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although the mPDAI score improved significantly with surgery regardless of infliximab, it decreased more from baseline in patients with infliximab (50.0%) than in those without infliximab (28.6%), (P = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In the long-term, recurrence rates were low regardless of infliximab in patients without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0156183" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">anorectal stricture</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0156183" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">anorectal stricture</z:e>, cumulative recurrence incidences increased gradually and exceeded 40% at 5 years regardless of infliximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>No efficacy of infliximab treatment was found (P = 0.97) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Although the cumulative rate of ostomy creation was also low in patients without stricture and high in patients with stricture, no protective efficacy was found with infliximab treatment (P = 0.6 without stricture, P = 0.22 with stricture) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Infliximab treatment was demonstrated to have short-term efficacy for perianal lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Long-term benefit with infliximab was not proven, at least in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0156183" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">anorectal stricture</z:e> </plain></SENT>
