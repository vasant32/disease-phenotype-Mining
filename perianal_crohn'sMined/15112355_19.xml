<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective analysis of patients seen for 20 years (between 1983 and 2002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Individual case records were reviewed with regard to history, clinical, findings from colonoscopy, biopsies, small bowel enema, computerized tomography scan, treatment and outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventy-seven patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> were revisited, 13% presented the disease in the first 10 years and 87% over the last 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty-three patients (42.9%) were males and 44 (57.1%) were females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Age ranged from 11-70 years (mean of 25.3+/-11.3 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ninety-two (92%) were Saudi </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean duration of symptoms was 26+/-34.7 mo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean annual incidence of the disease over the first 10 years was 0.32:100,000 and 1.66:100,000 over the last 10 years with a total mean annual incidence of 0.94:100,000 over the last 20 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The chief clinical features included <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001824'>weight loss</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002039'>anorexia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002573'>rectal bleeding</z:hpo> and palpable mass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Colonoscopic findings were abnormal in 58 patients (76%) showing mostly ulcerations and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> of the colon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Eighty nine percent of patients showed nonspecific <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> inflammatory cells and half of these patients revealed the presence of granulomas and granulations on bowel biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Similarly, 69 (89%) of small bowel enema results revealed ulcerations (49%), narrowing of the bowel lumen (42%), mucosal thickening (35%) and cobblestone appearance (35%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CT scan showed abnormality in 68 (88%) of patients with features of thickened loops (66%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>lymphadenopathy</z:hpo> (37%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Seventy-eight percent of patients had small and large <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021831" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bowel disease</z:e>, 16% had small bowel involvement and only 6% had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Of the total 55 (71%) patients treated with steroids at some point in their disease history, a satisfactory response to therapy was seen in 28 patients (51%) while 27 (49%) showed recurrences of the condition with mild to moderate symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> most of which were due to poor compliance to medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Seven patients (33%) remained with active <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Nine (12%) patients underwent surgery with resections of some parts of bowel, 2 (2.5%) had steroid side effects, 6 (8%) with perianal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> and five (6.5%) with fistulae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The epidemiological characteristics of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> among Saudi patients are comparable to those reported from other parts of the world </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>However the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100280'>Crohn's disease</z:hpo> in our hospital increased over the last 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The anatomic distribution of the disease is different from other world institutions with less isolated colonic affection </plain></SENT>
