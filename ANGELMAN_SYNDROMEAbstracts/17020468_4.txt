We present a new method for differential diagnosis of Prader-Willi (PWS) and Angelman syndromes (AS) that requires only a small amount of DNA including that obtained from amniocentesis specimens. This method not only proved to be robust and rapid, but, most importantly, it can be dosage sensitive, supplying additional information useful for genetic counselling. After methylation-dependent digestion of DNA with HpaII or McrBC, exon 1 of the SNRPN gene is amplified together with a sequence in the CpG island of the H19 gene. Given the similarities in sequence composition and methylation status between the amplified sequences, their co-amplification under semiquantitative conditions allows an easy discrimination between single dosage (present in deletions or chromosomal translocations) and a double-dosage state (uniparental disomy or imprinting error), when the appropriate controls are included. The method we have developed in combination with standard cytogenetic studies and segregation analysis of microsatellite markers offers a rapid and easy procedure to resolve most suspected cases of PWS and AS, and consequently to provide accurate genetic counselling.
