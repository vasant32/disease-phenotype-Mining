AIM:  Angelman syndrome is a rare neurogenetic disorder resulting in delayed neuropsychological development,  intellectual disability, speech impairment, movement or balance disorder and a behavioural uniqueness. It is caused by  deletion of maternal chromosome 15q11-13. The syndrome has oral manifestations such as diastemas, tongue thrusting,  sucking/swallowing disorder, mandibular prognathism, and wide mouth. The dental literature on the syndrome is scarce.  CASE REPORT:  We report our approach to dental procedures in Angelman syndrome patients, and the relationship between  the dental staff and the patient and his family. The purpose of this paper is to highlight the possibility of dental treatment in  general anaesthesia, due to the lack of cooperation of some of these patients.
