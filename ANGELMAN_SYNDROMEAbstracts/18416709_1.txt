An 8-month-old girl and a 20-month-old boy who presented with motor and developmental delay and long-standing fever are presented. The patients were diagnosed as Angelman syndrome with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis. Despite extensive clinical and laboratory examinations, no inflammatory or infectious origin for the fever was found. It was considered that the long-standing fever observed in these cases was due to hypothalamic dysfunction for thermoregulation.
