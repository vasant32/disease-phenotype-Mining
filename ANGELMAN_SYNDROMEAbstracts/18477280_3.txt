We describe the administration of anaesthesia to a patient with Angelman syndrome, which is characterised by an abnormality of chromosome 15, where a subunit of the GABA receptor is coded. This has far-reaching anaesthetic implications as many drugs used in anaesthesia are thought to act via GABA receptors. Our patient had an uneventful peri-operative period and was discharged home on the second postoperative day.
