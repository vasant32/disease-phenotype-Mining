Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and Angelman syndrome (AS) are two clinically distinct neurogenetic disorders arising from a loss of expression of imprinted genes within the human chromosome region 15q11-q13. Recent evidence suggests that the SNRPN gene, which is defective in PWS, plays a central role in the imprinting-center regulation of the PWS/AS region. To increase our understanding of the regulation of expression of this imprinted gene, we have developed single-cell-sensitive procedures for the analysis of expression of the SNRPN gene during early human development. Transcripts of SNRPN were detected in human oocytes and at all stages of preimplantation development analyzed. Using embryos heterozygous for a polymorphism within the SNRPN gene, we showed that monoallelic expression from the paternal allele occurs by the 4-cell stage. Thus, the imprinting epigenetic information inherited in the gametes is recognized already in the preimplantation embryo. The demonstration of monoallelic expression in embryos means that efficient preimplantation diagnosis of PWS may be made by analysis for the presence or absence of SNRPN mRNA.
