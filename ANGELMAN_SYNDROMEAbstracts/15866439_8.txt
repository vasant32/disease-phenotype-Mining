Rett syndrome and Angelman syndrome are two neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by partial overlapping features. Rett syndrome is frequently caused by a mutation in methyl-CpG-binding protein (MECP2) gene, localized on chromosome Xq28, whereas Angelman syndrome is frequently caused by different genetic anomalies at chromosome 15q11-q13 (deletions, uniparental disomy, imprinting center mutations, ubiquitin E3 ligase [UBE3A] gene mutations). Recently, some patients with a clinical diagnosis of Angelman syndrome were found to have a mutation in MECP2 gene. This report describes another patient with an Angelman-like phenotype and with an MECP2 mutation.
