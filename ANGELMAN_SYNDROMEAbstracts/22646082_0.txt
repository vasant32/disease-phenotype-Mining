 OBJECTIVE: To examine the impact of teaching approaches based on the principles of applied behaviour analysis (ABA) on neurodevelopmental outcomes in children with Angelman syndrome (AS). METHODS: A non-randomized pre-test-post-test control group design was used. The intervention group consisted of four children with AS aged 3.1-9.2 years. Controls were other children with AS who were individually matched on the basis of chronological age, gender and molecular sub-type. Children in the intervention group were provided two-to-three ABA-based therapy sessions per week over a 1-year period. Standardized measures of cognitive, adaptive and language functioning were administered at baseline and after 1 year. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups at baseline or after 1 year. However, positive trends were observed in the intervention group for some cognitive and adaptive measures. CONCLUSION: ABA-based intervention improved aspects of neurodevelopment for some children with AS and warrants further study.
