Recombination between chromosome-specific low-copy repeats (duplicons) is an underlying mechanism for several genetic disorders. Recently, a chromosome 15 duplicon was discovered in the common breakpoint regions of Prader-Willi and Angelman syndrome deletions. We identified previously the large HERC2 transcript as an ancestral gene in this duplicon, with approximately 11 HERC2-containing duplicons, and demonstrated that recessive mutations in mouse Herc2 lead to a developmental syndrome, juvenile development and fertility 2 (jdf2). We have now constructed and sequenced a genomic contig of HERC2, revealing a total of 93 exons spanning approximately 250 kb and a CpG island promoter. A processed ribosomal protein L41 pseudogene occurs in intron 2 of HERC2, and putative VNTRs occur in intron 70 (28 copies, approximately 76-bp repeat) and 3' exon 40 through intron 40 (6 copies, approximately 62-bp repeat). Sequence comparisons show that HERC2-containing duplicons have undergone several deletion, inversion, and dispersion events to form complex duplicons in 15q11, 15q13, and 16p11. To further understand the developmental role of HERC2, a highly conserved Drosophila ortholog was characterized, with 70% amino acid sequence identity to human HERC2 over the carboxy-terminal 743 residues. Combined, these studies provide significant insights into the structure of complex duplicons and into the evolutionary pathways of formation, dispersal, and genomic instability of duplicons. Our results establish that some genes not only have a protein coding function but can also play a structural role in the genome.
