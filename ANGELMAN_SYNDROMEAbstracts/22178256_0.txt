We describe a novel chromosome microdeletion at 15q26.1 detected by oligo-array-CGH in a 6-year-old girl presenting with global development delay, epilepsy, autistic behavior and facial dysmorphisms. Although these features are often present in Angelman syndrome, no alterations were present in the methylation pattern of the Prader-Willi-Angelman critical region. The deletion encompasses only 2 genes: CHD2, which is part of a gene family already involved in CHARGE syndrome, and RGMA which exerts a negative control on axon growth. Deletion of either or both genes could cause the phenotype of this patient. These results provide a further chromosome region requiring evaluation in patients presenting Angelman features.
