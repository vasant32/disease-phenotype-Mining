The human chromosomal 15q11-15q13 region is subject to both maternal and paternal genomic imprinting. Absence of paternal gene expression from this region results in Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), while absence of maternal gene expression leads to Angelman syndrome. Transcription of paternally expressed genes in the region depends upon an imprinting center termed the PWS-IC. Imprinting defects in PWS can be caused by microdeletions and the smallest commonly deleted region indicates that the PWS-IC lies within a region of 4.3 kb. The function and location of the PWS-IC is evolutionarily conserved, but delineation of the PWS-IC in mouse has proven difficult. The first targeted mutation of the PWS-IC, a deletion of 35 kb spanning Snrpn exon 1, exhibited a complete PWS-IC deletion phenotype. Pups inheriting this mutation paternally showed a complete loss of paternal gene expression and died neonatally. A reported deletion of 4.8 kb showed only a reduction in paternal gene expression and incomplete penetrance of neonatal lethality, suggesting that some PWS-IC function had been retained. Here, we report that a 6 kb deletion spanning Snrpn exon 1 exhibits a complete PWS-IC deletion phenotype. Pups inheriting this mutation paternally lack detectable expression of all PWS genes and paternal silencing of Ube3a, exhibit maternal DNA methylation imprints at Ndn and Mkrn3 and suffer failure to thrive leading to a fully penetrant neonatal lethality.
