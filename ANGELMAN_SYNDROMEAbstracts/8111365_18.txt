The Prader-Willi syndrome and the Angelman syndrome are caused by the loss of function of distinct but closely linked genes on human chromosome 15. Based on a yeast artificial chromosome restriction map and two key patients we have determined that the shortest region of deletion overlap in the Prader-Willi syndrome comprises 320 kb. The region includes the anonymous DNA marker PW71 (D15S63) and the gene for the small nuclear ribonucleoprotein N (SNRPN). The SNRPN gene maps 130 kb distal to PW71 and is transcribed from centromere to telomere.
