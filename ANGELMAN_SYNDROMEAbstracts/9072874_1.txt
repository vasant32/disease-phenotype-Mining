The diagnosis of Angelman syndrome has seldom been made in infancy because the typical craniofacial dysmorphism and the typical outbursts of unprovoked laughter are not fully developed before the second and third year of life. Other features such as mental retardation or absence of language, though invariably present, are less obvious in the first year of life. We describe three children in whom consecutive electroencephalographic (EEG) studies show very large amplitude slow activity at 2-3/s, often rhythmic, usually occurring in prolonged runs and often more prominent posteriorly, sometimes with spikes or sharp-wave activity, and invariably associated with a diffuse rhythmic activity at 4-6/ s of 200 microvolts. The changes were present as early as six months of life. They preceded development of seizure and occurred much earlier than the craniofacial dysmorphology. It is concluded that methodical use of EEG in the elucidation of children with developmental disorder and knowledge of the characteristic EEG picture may help to identify patients with Angelman syndrome at an early age and before the clinical features become obvious.
