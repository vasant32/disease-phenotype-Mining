The human chromosome 15q11-q13 region hosts a wide variety of coding and noncoding RNAs, and is also the site of nearly every imaginable type of RNA processing. To deepen the intrigue, the transcripts in the human chromosome 15q11-q13 region are subject to regulation by genomic imprinting, and some of these transcripts are imprinted in a tissue-specific manner. As the region is critically important for three human neurogenetic disorders, Angelman syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome, and 15q duplication syndrome, there is intense interest in understanding the types of RNA and RNA processing that occurs among the imprinted genes. This review summarizes what is known about the various RNAs within the imprinted domain, including a novel type of RNA that was only very recently identified.
