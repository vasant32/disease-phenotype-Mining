We present our experience with cross-hybridization of D15Z1, used in combination with D15S10, D15S11 or SNRPN, in 109 clinical cases referred for Angelman syndrome (AS), Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), for autism to rule out duplication of 15q11.2, or to identify structural chromosome abnormalities thought to involve chromosome 15. Nine cases with normal karyotypes studied with at least one of these probe mixtures showed an extra signal with D15Z1 on a chromosome 14. One case showed absence of the D15Z1 signal from 15p and one case showed an extra signal with D15Z1 on both chromosome 14s. Sixteen cases from this series had structural abnormalities, which included ten cases with supernumerary markers, three of which had a D15Z1 signal on a chromosome 14. The remaining cases did not have an extra signal on chromosome 14, but included rearrangements between Y and 15, 15 and 19, and a r(15), all with breakpoints in 15p11.1 or p11.2. Of the three cases with a supernumerary marker and an extra D15Z1 signal on a chromosome 14, one was a maternally derived marker, while the variant 14 was paternal in origin. The other two markers were de novo. The high frequency of variant 14 in cases with supernumerary markers (30%) was not significant by Chi-square analysis compared to the overall frequency in 109 cases of 11.9%. The overall frequency is consistent with a previous report by Stergianou et al. (1993). We can now add that a false-negative result may occur slightly less than 1% of the time. The chance that both chromosome 14 homologs will be positive for D15Z1 is theoretically about 1 in 300. If associated with an abnormal phenotype, the possibility of uniparental disomy should be ruled out.
