The communication profiles of individuals with Down's syndrome (DS), Angelman syndrome (AS) and pervasive developmental disorder (PDD) were investigated and contrasted. Seventy-seven individuals participated in the study. A within-group analysis revealed that those with DS performed better on tacting or labelling and echoing than on manding or requesting. No other effects were found, apart from an absence of echoing in those with AS, a result that is hardly surprising. A between-groups analysis revealed no differences between the aetiological groups in terms of their use of mands or requests and tacts. Individuals with DS and PDD did not differ in their scores on echoic functioning. The implications of these findings for the study of behavioural phenotypes and for communication intervention are discussed.
