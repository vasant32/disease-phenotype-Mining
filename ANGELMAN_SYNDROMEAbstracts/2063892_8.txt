We report on a newborn boy with pronounced hypotonia, cryptorchidism, minor facial anomalies, congenital heart defect, neurologic anomaly, deafness, renal anomaly, and bifid uvula. The patient has a de novo proximal interstitial deletion of chromosome 15 reaching to band q14, larger than that usually seen in Prader-Willi and Angelman syndromes.
