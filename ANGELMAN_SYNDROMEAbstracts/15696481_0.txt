 OBJECTIVE: To establish a novel method for the multiplex analysis of the methylation and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). METHODS: The imprinted SNP rs220028 was chosen as a model. Genomic DNA, after being digested with methylation sensitive restriction enzyme, were typed by mutagenically separated PCR (MS-PCR). The polymorphism of restriction site was excluded by PCR-RFLP. RESULTS: By post-digestion MS-PCR, the methylated allele was detected selectively, the maternal origin of which was confirmed by pedigree analysis; A=0.5085, G=0.4915,PIC=0.3749. CONCLUSION: The multiplex analysis of methylation markers and SNP can be achieved by post-digestion MS-PCR. The imprinted SNP locus rs220028 is a potentially useful marker in screening Prader-Willi/Angelman syndrome.
