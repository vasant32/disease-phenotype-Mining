The relationship between varying blood glucose levels and problem behavior during daily scheduled activities was examined. The effects that varying blood glucose levels had on problem behavior during daily scheduled activities were examined. Prior research has shown that differing blood glucose levels can affect behavior and mood. Results of this study showed that often, when blood glucose levels were high, the rate of problem behavior was higher than when blood glucose levels were within normal range. Future research should continue to evaluate the effects that differing blood glucose conditions have on problem behavior in people with developmental disabilities.
