Complementary DNA clones from the pink-eyed dilution (p) locus of mouse chromosome 7 were isolated from murine melanoma and melanocyte libraries. The transcript from this gene is missing or altered in six independent mutant alleles of the p locus, suggesting that disruption of this gene results in the hypopigmentation phenotype that defines mutant p alleles. Characterization of the human homolog revealed that it is localized to human chromosome 15 at q11.2-q12, a region associated with Prader-Willi and Angelman syndromes, suggesting that altered expression of this gene may be responsible for the hypopigmentation phenotype exhibited by certain individuals with these disorders.
