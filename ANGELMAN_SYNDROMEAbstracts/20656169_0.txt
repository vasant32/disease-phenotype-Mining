We describe a patient with Angelman syndrome with severe developmental delay who was visually impaired by uncorrected high hyperopia and poor control of accommodation. Refractive lens exchange with intraocular lens implantation was performed in both eyes when the patient was 22 years of age. Satisfactory anatomical and functional outcomes were achieved and maintained during 3 years of follow-up. Refractive lens exchange can be useful in patients with severe neurobehavioral disorders in the presence of high refractive error and poor accommodative control.
