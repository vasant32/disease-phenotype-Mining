Human chromosome 15q11-q13 encompasses the Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and the Angelman syndrome (AS) loci, which are subject to parental imprinting, a process that marks the parental origin of certain chromosomal subregions. A temporal and spatial association between maternal and paternal chromosomes 15 was observed in human T lymphocytes by three-dimensional fluorescence in situ hybridization. This association occurred specifically at the imprinted 15q11-q13 regions only during the late S phase of the cell cycle. Cells from PWS and AS patients were deficient in association, which suggests that normal imprinting involves mutual recognition and preferential association of maternal and paternal chromosomes 15.
