We report on a girl with monosomy 1p36.3 and Angelman syndrome due to an unbalanced transmission of a maternal balanced chromosomal translocation. She manifested monosomy 1p36 and Angelman syndrome including generalized hypopigmentation, ataxic movements, intractable seizures with characteristic electroencephalographic (EEG) abnormality compatible with Angelman syndrome, and other minor anomalies, large anterior fontanelle, severe psychomotor retardation, and seizures due to monosomy 1p36. Her karyotype was 45, XX, der(1) t(1;15)(p36.31;q13.1),-15, derived from maternal translocation. Molecular analysis determined a breakpoint of 1p between D1S243 and D1S468, which suggested that most genes contributing to the common phenotype are in the distal region.
