Angelman syndrome (AS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by failure of expression of the maternal copy of the imprinted UBE3A gene through a variety of mechanisms detected by methylation studies, mutation analysis of UBE3A and FISH. In 10-15% of suspected cases of AS these investigations do not reveal a genetic abnormality. We report here the development of a semi-quantitative dosage PCR technique used to identify sub-microscopic deletions involving UBE3A. Using this method we analysed a panel of 26 patients from 24 families, all fulfilling the clinical criteria for AS. We identified a deletion of UBE3A exons 8-16 in a sibling pair. Analysis of parental samples revealed the same deletion in their phenotypically normal mother. This is an inexpensive and valuable method for detecting UBE3A deletions in a small but important proportion of AS cases of unidentifiable cause.
