The 4 Mb 15q11-q13 region is prone to structural rearrangements. Deletions have been identified among the leading causes for genetic diseases such as the Prader-Willi and Angelman syndromes, while duplications, occurring preferentially on the maternal chromosome, produce a typical phenotype that includes mental retardation, language delay, seizures and autism. Although a number of such patients have been reported, however, there is a paucity of information about their clinical outcomes in adult age. We report on a 33-year-old female with a microduplication of 15q11-q13 detected by array-CGH analysis, with particular reference to the epilepsy phenotype, characterized as a late-onset Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.
