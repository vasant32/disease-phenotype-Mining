The introduction of intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) has raised concern about safety in terms of a possible increase in the incidence of major congenital malformations, chromosomal aberrations or developmental problems. The possible influence of genetic imprinting on an ICSI procedure has not yet been investigated. We therefore studied the DNA-methylation status at a defined region in chromosome 15q11-q13 in 92 children born after an ICSI procedure. Imprinting defects in this region are associated with neurogenetic disorders, e.g. Angelman syndrome (AS) and Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). Blood samples were taken directly after birth and stored at -80 degrees C. Genomic DNA purification was performed from 3-7 ml EDTA-blood. Sodium bisulphite treatment was carried out in order to distinguish methylated from unmethylated DNA by transferring the unmethylated nucleic acid cytosine into uracil and leaving the methylated cytosine unchanged. Subsequently, a methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (M-PCR) was performed. In all 92 children (83 from ICSI with ejaculated spermatozoa and nine from ICSI with non-ejaculated spermatozoa), a regular DNA-methylation pattern was found in the PWS/AS region. In none of the children were clinical symptoms of PWS or AS present. In conclusion, the results of this study do not indicate a higher risk of DNA-methylation defects in children born after ICSI.
