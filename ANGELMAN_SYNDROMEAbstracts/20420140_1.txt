Angelman syndrome is a hereditary disease described by Angelman. The clinical features of Angelman syndrome are characterized by mental retardation, puppet-like ataxia, easily excitable personality, seizures, paroxysmal laughter, strabismus and macroglossia. A 4-year-old girl with Angelman syndrome underwent strabismus repair under general anesthesia. Anesthesia was slowly induced with sevoflurane in oxygen and maintained with air, oxygen, propofol and remifentanil. Tracheal intubation was performed after administration of rocuronium. During and after anesthesia, no adverse events regarding circulatory and respiratory systems occurred. However, this case demonstrates that it is necessary to pay attention to airway troubles including the difficulty of tracheal intubation, management of body temperature and chronotropic action or respiratory depression by anesthetic agents.
