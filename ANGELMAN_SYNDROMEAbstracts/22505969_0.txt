Angelman Syndrome is a neurodevelopmental condition with a characteristic phenotype that includes epilepsy and lack of communication. We describe its first reported association with Schatzki's ring that presented as a life-long history of intermittent retching. Because of associated cognitive dysfunction, careful diagnostic consideration is required to detect this underlying condition. KEYWORDS: Schatzki's ring; Angelman Syndrome; Esophageal "B" ring; Barium esophagogram; Neurodevelopmental delay; Retching.
