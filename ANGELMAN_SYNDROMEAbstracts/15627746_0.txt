We report on a girl with severe mental and psychomotor retardation caused by an unusual, unbalanced translocation t(14;15) of maternal origin. The unbalanced translocation in the patient resulted in trisomy 14pter-->q13 and monosomy 15pter-->q11.2. In addition to common features described in other patients with small proximal trisomies of chromosome 14, our patient presented with hypopigmented skin with light hair and eye color and severe speech impairment. Therefore the phenotype of the girl shows few similarities to that of Angelman syndrome patients, although the breakpoint in chromosome 15 in our patient was found to be proximal to the PWS/AS region.
