We report on a detailed phenotypic characterization of two patients with novel de novo deletions involving 15q13q14, a chromosomal region immediately distal to the Prader-Willi/Angelman syndrome critical interval. Both cases were detected by the clinical array-based comparative genomic hybridization (array-CGH) and were precisely delineated through the high-density Agilent 244 K oligonucleotide array. The comparison of our patients with previously reported deletion cases involving the 15q13q14 region demonstrated a recurrent pattern of developmental anomalies including mild dysmorphic features, cleft palate/bifid uvula, congenital heart defects (PFO or ASD), developmental delay, and learning disabilities. The potential role of the genes within the deleted region in the pathogenesis of these various phenotypic abnormalities is discussed.
