Children with Angelman syndrome have an increased risk of developing a nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Although the urgency to treat nonconvulsive status epilepticus depends on the underlying illness, most clinicians and authors agree that treatment should be focused to rapidly terminate this condition. Until now, the use of levetiracetam to treat nonconvulsive status epilepticus in children is based only on some case reports. Our case further supports this treatment regime for a subgroup of children with a special risk of nonconvulsive status epilepticus and developmental delay.
