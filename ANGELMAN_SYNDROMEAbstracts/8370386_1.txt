A patient with typical features of Angelman syndrome--a genetically inherited disorder involving developmental delay, ataxia, episodes of paroxysmal laughter and brachiocephaly--was studied with single-photon emission tomography. Hypoperfusion found in the left frontal and left temporoparietal regions can provide insights into the functional cerebral pathology, which may be due to a disturbance of the developmental process related to a chromosomal abnormality.
