Six cases of this syndrome previously reported in Great Britain and in Canada are reviewed in relation to a personal case, a 17-month-old boy. The syndrome's main features are microbrachycephaly and peculiar face, mental deficiency with euphoria and laughter, ataxia and epilepsy consisting in infantile spasms and grand-mal attacks. Though its precise nature and cause still remain unknown, the syndrome seems neither familial nor progressive.
