The Zfp127 gene is located on mouse chromosome 7 in an imprinted region that is homologous to the 2-Mb Prader-Willi and Angelman Syndromes region on human chromosome 15q11-q13. Here, we show that the gene is differentially methylated, the maternal allele being methylated and the paternal allele being unmethylated. This maternal methylation is established promptly after fertilization prior to syngamy. We also provide data that demonstrate the significance of methylation in the paternal expression of the gene. The expression of the Zfp127 gene in methyltransferase-deficient mice is significantly higher, suggesting that the gene is biallelically expressed in these mice. The data presented here will help to understand the mechanism by which the monoallelic expression of the entire 2-Mb Prader-Willi and Angelman Syndrome region is regulated.
