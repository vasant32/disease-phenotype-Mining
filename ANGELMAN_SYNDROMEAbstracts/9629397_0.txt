The authors describe the case of a typical Angelman syndrome patient. The proband presents developmental delay, mental retardation, macrostomia, wide-spaced teeth, seizures, absent speech, jerky gait, and paroxysms of laughter. The cytogenetic and molecular studies showed a maternal deletion of 15q11q13. These results are in agreement with the clinical diagnosis of Angelman syndrome.
