Patients with disorders involving imprinted genes such as Angelman syndrome (AS) and Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) can have a mutation in the imprinting mechanism. Previously, we identified an imprinting center (IC) within chromosome 15q11-ql3 and proposed that IC mutations block resetting of the imprint, fixing on that chromosome the parental imprint (epigenotype) on which the mutation arose. We now describe four new microdeletions of the IC, the smallest (6 kb) of which currently defines the minimal region sufficient to confer an AS imprinting mutation. The AS deletions all overlap this minimal region, centromeric to the PWS microdeletions, which include the first exon of the SNRPN gene. None of five genes or transcripts in the 1.0 Mb vicinity of the IC (ZNF127, SNRPN, PAR-5, IPW, and PAR-1), each normally expressed only from the paternal allele, was expressed in cells from PWS imprinting mutation patients. In contrast, AS imprinting mutation patients show biparental expression of SNRPN and IPW but must lack expression of the putative AS gene 250-1000 kb distal of the IC. These data strongly support a model in which the paternal chromosome of these PWS patients carries an ancestral maternal epigenotype, and the maternal chromosome of these AS patients carries an ancestral paternal epigenotype. The IC therefore functions to reset the maternal and paternal imprints throughout a 2-Mb imprinted domain within human chromosome 15q11-q13 during gametogenesis.
