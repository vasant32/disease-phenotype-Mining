To assess the frequency of cytogenetic abnormalities in children with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), routine G-banded cytogenetic analyses and FISH studies to rule out 15q11.2 and 17p11.2 duplications were performed on 49 children with ASDs. Blood samples were further studied using a complete set of subtelomeric FISH probes. Routine chromosome study showed that one child had a small duplication of chromosome 5: 46,XY,dup(5)(p?14.2p?15.1). Another child had an interstitial duplication of the Prader-Willi and Angelman syndrome critical region of chromosome 15, detected by FISH analysis. The detection of these two cases underscores the importance of obtaining routine chromosome and 15q11-q13 FISH analyses in children with ASDs. No instance of 17p11.2 duplication was observed. Subtelomeric analysis did not reveal abnormalities in any of the subjects.
