Nine children with the "happy puppet" syndrome are presented here and 19 previously reported cases are reviewed. A characteristic psychological profile is suggested by the children's "unfocused" activities and inconsistent responsiveness to their surroundings. Behavioral characteristics are atypical for mental age and do not appear to represent unusual seizure equivalents. Recognition of such non-adaptive behavior may be of importance in selecting specific treatment and management techniques to modify the characteristics of this syndrome at an early age.
