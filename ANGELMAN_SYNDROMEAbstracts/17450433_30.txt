 PURPOSE: The prevalence of low birth weight (LBW) is increased in subjects born after assisted reproduction technology (ART), and defective imprinting has frequently been identified in patients with Beckwith-Wiedermann and Angelman syndromes conceived by ART. Thus, we examined methylation pattern in a girl born after ART who had Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS) which can be caused by maternal uniparental disomy for chromosome 7 and by hypomethylation of the differentially methylated region (DMR) of H19. METHODS: We examined methylation status of 31 cytosines at the CpG dinucleotides in the DMR of PEG1/MEST on 7q32.2 and 23 cytosines at the CpG dinucleotides in the DMR of H19 on 11p15, using leukocyte genomic DNA. RESULTS: Eight of the 31 cytosines in the patient and four of the 31 cytosines in the father were hypermethylated in the PEG1/MEST-DMR. In the H19-DMR, no abnormal methylation pattern was identified in the patient. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that hypermethylation of paternally expressed genes including PEG1/MEST, which usually have growth-promoting effects, may be relevant to LBW in subjects conceived by ART.
