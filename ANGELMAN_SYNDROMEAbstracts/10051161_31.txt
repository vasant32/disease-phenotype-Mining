Interstitial duplications of proximal 15q containing the Prader-Willi syndrome/Angelman syndrome (PWS/AS) region have been found in patients with autism or atypical autism. In these cases with an abnormal phenotype, the duplications were maternally derived. Paternal origin of the duplication has been associated with a normal phenotype. We report on a patient who presented with nonspecific developmental delay and partial agenesis of the rostral corpus callosum. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) studies using probes specific for the PWS/AS region demonstrated a double signal on one chromosome 15, indicating the presence of an interstitial duplication of proximal 15q involving the PWS/ AS region in the patient. Parental chromosomes were normal with FISH studies. Methylation analysis at exon alpha of the SNRPN locus showed a maternal band at 4.2 kb and a paternal band of apparent double intensity at 0.9 kb, suggestive of one copy of the maternal allele and two copies of the paternal allele in the patient. Microsatellite analysis was informative at the GABRB3 locus in the family, which showed the inheritance of two different paternal alleles and a maternal allele in the patient consistent with the origin of this duplication from an unequal crossing over between the two chromosome 15 homologs in the father. This is the first report of an abnormal phenotype associated with a paternally derived duplication of proximal 15q shown to contain the PWS/AS region by molecular techniques.
