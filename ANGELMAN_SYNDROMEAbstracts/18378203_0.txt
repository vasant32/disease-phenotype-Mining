Supernumerary invdup(15) chromosomes, now also reported as sSMC(15), containing two additional copies of Prader-Willi/Angelman critical region (PWACR) have been associated with distinct clinical phenotype that includes hypotonia, dysmorphisms, developmental delay/mental retardation, autistic behaviour, and epilepsy. We report on a healthy adult male carrying an sSMC(15) with two copies of PWACR in 20-50% of cells from different tissues. Molecular analyses showed the sSMC(15) as resulting from a PWACR-duplicated region spanning 8Mb which is larger than those in the only two other healthy PWACR-duplicated sSMC(15) carriers previously reported. Mosaicism level and mosaic cell line rate variation among different tissues observed in our case support mosaicism in critical tissues as of relevance for sSMC(15) phenotype-genotype correlations.
