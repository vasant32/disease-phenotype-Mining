 OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical manifestations and EEG characteristics of Angelman syndrome in children, and to strengthen the recognition of this disease. METHOD: Fourteen children with Angelman syndrome received video EEG monitoring, head MRI/CT and gene test, 11 patients received the metabolic investigations (e.g., lactic acid, ammonia, GC/MS and MS/MS). Eight patients received Gesell test. The patients were followed up for 1-3 years. RESULT: Of the 14 cases, 4 were male and 10 female, their age was from 8 months to 3 years and 7 months. The clinical characteristics included prominent lower jaw and wide mouth, fair skin and yellow hair, light-colored iris, paroxysmal laughter, astasia and language backward. Twelve patients had epileptic seizures; 10 patients displayed non-convulsive status epilepticus (NCSE), 9 patients displayed myoclonic, atypical absence, and non-convulsive seizure simultaneously; myoclonic, generalized tonic-clonic seizure and complex partial seizure in 1 each; 4 patients had fever in early seizures. The EEG showed paroxysmal middle-high amplitude 2-3 Hz spike and spinous slow-wave in 8 patients. Four patients showed paroxysmal frequently middle-high amplitude 2-3 Hz slow waves mixed with sharps. The other 2 patients showed a normal EEG. All the patients were diagnosed with genetics testing. The results included maternal deletion of chromosome 15q11-13 in 12, paternal uniparental disomy in 1 and imprinting defects in 1. CONCLUSION: There are characteristic clinical manifestation and craniofacial features in Angelman syndrome patients. Some patients have specific EEG patterns. Abnormal region of chromosome 15q11-13 is the basis of diagnosis.
