The deleted region of the proximal long arm of human chromosome 15, common to a large group of patients with the Prader-Willi and Angelman syndromes, has recently been defined. We have mapped to the mouse genome segments homologous to human probes found within and flanking this deletional region. These probes define a region of conserved synteny on proximal chromosome 7 of the mouse. Because the Prader-Willi and Angelman syndromes are postulated to result from genomic imprinting within the common deletion, these probes may define a genomically imprinted region on mouse chromosome 7.
