The gene for 7B2, a protein found in the secretory granules of neural and endocrine cells (gene symbol SGNE1) was localized to the E3-F3 region of mouse chromosome 2 and to the q11-q15 region of human chromosome 15. This was determined by in situ hybridization, using a mouse 7B2 cDNA and an intronic fragment of the corresponding human gene as probes. The respective locations of SGNE1 in the two species correlate with the conservation of loci between these subregions of mouse chromosome 2 and human chromosome 15. Clinically, the human SGNE1 DNA fragment may serve as a molecular probe of this locus in both the Prader-Willi and the Angelman syndromes, which are often accompanied by submicroscopic chromosomal deletions in the 15q11-15q13 region.
