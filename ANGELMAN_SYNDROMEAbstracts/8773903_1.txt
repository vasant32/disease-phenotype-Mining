We report on a mentally retarded boy with epileptic seizures, microcephaly, ataxia, and developmental delay. His clinical features were consistent with Angelman syndrome. Fluorescent in situ hybridization and DNA analysis showed a deletion of chromosome 15 q11-13 and thus confirmed the diagnosis. In addition, the patient had a unilateral, incomplete cleft lip, a feature which has not previously been reported in Angelman syndrome.
