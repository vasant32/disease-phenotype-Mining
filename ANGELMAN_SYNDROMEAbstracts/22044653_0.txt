 BACKGROUND: Sleep concerns are common in children with Angelman syndrome, with 20-80% of individuals having a decreased sleep need and/or abnormal sleep-wake cycles. The impact of these sleep behaviours on parental sleep and stress is not known. METHOD: Through the use of standardised questionnaires, wrist actigraphy and polysomnography, we defined the sleep behaviours of 15 children/adolescents with Angelman syndrome and the association of the child/adolescents sleep behaviours on parental sleep behaviours and parental stress. RESULTS: Both children/adolescents and their parents exhibited over 1â€ƒh of wake time after sleep onset and fragmented sleep. Prolonged sleep latency in the child was associated with parent insomnia and daytime sleepiness. Additionally, variability in child total sleep time was associated with parental stress. CONCLUSIONS: Poor sleep in children/adolescents with Angelman syndrome was associated with poor parental sleep and higher parental stress. Further work is warranted to identify the underlying causes of the poor sleep, and to relate these findings to daytime functioning, behaviour and the family unit.
