Two patients with classical features of Angel-man syndrome (AS) and one with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) had unbalanced reciprocal translocations involving the chromosome 15 proximal long arm and the telomeric region of chromosomes 7, 8 and 10. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was used for the detection of chromosome 15(q11-13) deletions (with probes from the PWS/AS region) and to define the involvement of the telomere in the derivative chromosomes (with library probes and telomere-specific probes). The 15(q11-13) region was not deleted in one patient but was deleted in the other two. The telomere on the derivative chromosomes 7, 8 and 10 was deleted in all three cases. Thus, these are true reciprocal translocations in which there has been loss of the small satellited reciprocal chromosome (15) fragment.
