We have established a probe order within the Angelman/Prader-Willi chromosomal regions by multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). The probe [locus] order extending distally from the centromere is 34[D15S9]-IR4-3R[D15S11]-189-1[D15S13]-PW71++ + [D15S63]-3-21[D15S10]-28 beta 3-H3[GABRB3]-IR10-1 [D15S12]. This order agrees with that recently reported (1) with the exception of PW71 [D15S63]. In addition, a second gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABAA) receptor, the alpha 5 subunit, has been localized within the reference map to between GABRB3 and D15S12. The locus order was further confirmed by DNA hybridization analysis of two patients, one with Angelman syndrome and one with Prader-Willi syndrome, with different unbalanced translocations and molecular extents of deletion. Our results provide a framework map of chromosome 15q11-q13 into which additional markers can be oriented and allow a further differentiation of the critical genetic regions of the two syndromes.
