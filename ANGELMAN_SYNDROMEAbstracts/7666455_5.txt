Chromosomal changes through pericentric inversions play an important role in the origin of species. Certain pericentric inversions are too minute to be detected cytogenetically, thus hindering the complete reconstruction of hominoid phylogeny. The advent of the fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) technique has facilitated the identification of many chromosomal segments, even at the single gene level. Therefore the cosmid probe for Prader-Willi (PWS)/Angelman syndrome to the loci on human chromosome 15 [q11-13] is being used as a marker to highlight the complementary sequence in higher primates. We hybridized metaphase chromosomes of chimpanzee (PTR), gorilla (GGO), and orangutan (PPY) with this probe (Oncor) to characterize the chromosomal segments because the nature of these pericentric inversions remains relatively unknown. Our observations suggest that a pericentric inversion has occurred in chimpanzee chromosome (PTR 16) which corresponds to human chromosome 15 at PTR 16 band p11-12, while in gorilla (GGO 15) and orangutan (PPY 16) the bands q11-13 complemented to human chromosome 15 band q11-13. This approach has proven to be a better avenue to characterize the pericentric inversions which have apparently occurred during human evolution. "Genetic" divergence in the speciation process which occurs through "chromosomal" rearrangement needs to be reevaluated and further explored using newer techniques.
