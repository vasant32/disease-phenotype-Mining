A total of 95 patients suspected with the clinical diagnosis of AS were evaluated and 37 cases (39%) were confirmed by cytogenetic or molecular studies as affected by Angelman syndrome. The clinical analysis was performed according to a specific clinical protocol for the diagnosis of AS. Cytogenetical analysis was used to detect chromosome rearrangements by determining the karyotype in lymphocytes by GTG banding and revealed an abnormal karyotype in two cases (5.4%), both of them presenting a new pericentromeric inversion in chromosome 15. Molecular analyses included determination of DNA methylation within the 15q11-13 region by Southern blotting and microsattelite analysis within the 15q11-13 region by PCR and the UBE3A gene was also studied by mutational screening. In 16 cases (43.2%) a de novo deletion was detected in the maternal chromosome 15:3 cases (8.1%) presented imprinting defect at the 15q11-13 region; one case is due to a paternal uniparental dissomy (2.7%) and another two cases showed a inherited mutation at the UBE3A gene (5.4%). Thirteen cases (35.1%) showed no deletion, no UPD, no imprinting defect, no UBE3A mutation and the diagnosis of AS could be ruled out in 58 patients. The objective of the present work was to describe the clinical and laboratory protocols employed at our laboratory in order to establish the AS study. We conclude that the protocols employed here were efficient for the diagnosis of AS, a frequently underdiagnosed pathology.
