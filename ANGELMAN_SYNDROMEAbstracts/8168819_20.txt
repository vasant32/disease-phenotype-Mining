A 29-year-old male with Angelman syndrome and an unbalanced reciprocal translocation, 45,XY,-8, -15, +der(8),t(8;15)(p23.3;q11)pat, was evaluated with DNA studies. These showed the underlying mechanism to be paternal uniparental disomy. This is the second case reported of Angelman syndrome that has resulted from a familial unbalanced reciprocal translocation.
