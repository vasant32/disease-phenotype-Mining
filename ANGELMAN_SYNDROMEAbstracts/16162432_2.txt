Angelman syndrome is a neurogenetic disorder resulting in refractory epilepsy and profound psychomotor retardation in its most prevalent form, caused by deletion of maternal chromosome 15q11-13. We report the case of a 29-year-old, mentally retarded man with unusual electroencephalographic changes during periods of atypical absence status epilepticus, a previously unreported manifestation of the usually milder, drug-responsive epilepsy associated with Angelman syndrome due to the UBE3A mutation.[Published with video sequences].
