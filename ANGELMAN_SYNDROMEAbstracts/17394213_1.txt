Simultaneous occurrence of two unrelated cytogenetic events is rare. We present a case of Angelman Syndrome (AS) deletion and 12q duplication in a child with a history of developmental delay, microcephaly, cerebral palsy, and seizures. Traditional cytogenetic studies showed a normal 46,XY karyotype. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using probe D15S10 (AS region/15q11.2) revealed a deletion. In addition, we serendipitously detected 12q24.3 duplication by FISH with 12q subtelomere probe. He inherited this duplication from the mother who presented with a balanced translocation karyotype 46,XX,add(12)(q24.3).ish t(12;13)(q24.3;p11.2)(12qtel-;12qtel+,D13Z1/D21Z1+,RB1+). Array comparative genomic hybridization (array-CGH) revealed a duplication of three bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones (RP11-46H11, RP11-386I8, and RP11-309H3) covering about 423 Kb of DNA sequence. The published 12q terminal duplication cases had a detectable segment by classical banded cytogenetics techniques. To our knowledge, this is the smallest 12q cryptic rearrangement characterized by array-CGH and confirmed by BAC-clone FISH analysis. Based on these findings, we attempted to separate the clinical features associated with AS deletion and those features that are probably due to partial 12q duplication. We then reviewed the genes mapped in the duplicated region using the human genome database to understand the clinical significance. A subsequent pregnancy in the mother revealed an apparently balanced t(12;13) karyotype. We compare our case with the published cases, and discuss the implications of our findings and its relevance in addressing genetic counseling issues.
