Previous reports of individuals with autistic disorder with maternal duplications of 15q11-q13, the Prader-Willi/Angelman syndrome region, suggest this area as a source of candidate genes in autistic disorder. Maternal truncation mutations in UBE3A, which encodes for E6-AP ubiquitin-protein ligase, have been shown to cause Angelman syndrome, which can also result from the absence of maternal chromosomal material from this region. Despite showing no evidence for imprinting in other tissues, this gene was recently discovered to be preferentially maternally expressed in human brain and expressed solely from the murine maternal chromosome in the hippocampus and cerebellar Purkinje cells, regions implicated in the neuropathology of autism. Based on this evidence, the coding region and a putative promoter region were sequenced in ten autistic subjects. Several polymorphisms were detected, but no evidence was found for a functional mutation. Evidence for likely altered regulation of UBE3A expression in maternal 15q11-q13 duplications suggests further investigation of the regulatory regions of this gene in autistic disorder.
