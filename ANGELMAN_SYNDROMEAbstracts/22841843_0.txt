 BACKGROUND: Sleep problems are known to be common in Angelman syndrome (AS), a neurodevelopmental disorder which is associated with an abnormality of chromosome 15q11-q13. However, the circadian aspect of sleep disorders in AS and an effective treatment for the disorder have yet to be established. METHODS: We elucidated the sleep-wake patterns of AS patients and its relationship to the serum melatonin levels. The serum melatonin levels of 15 AS patients were measured every 4h for one day and the values were compared with those of age-matched controls. We also examined the effectiveness of the oral administration of melatonin on AS patients with circadian rhythm sleep disorders (CRSD). RESULTS: A total of eight of the 15 AS patients had CRSD (irregular sleep-wake type, n=4; free-running type n=2; delayed sleep phase type, n=2). The nighttime serum melatonin levels of the AS patients were significantly lower than those of the controls at the measured time points during the night. The nocturnal melatonin levels were comparably low both in AS patients with and without CRSD except for the cases with delayed sleep phase type, which showed normal but delayed peak melatonin level. Six out of eight CRSD cases were given a daily dose of 1mg of melatonin between 18:00 and 19:00 regularly for three months. After receiving the treatment, the sleep patterns improved in four cases. CONCLUSION: This study revealed a high prevalence of CRSD in AS patients, which may be related to abnormal serum melatonin profiles.
