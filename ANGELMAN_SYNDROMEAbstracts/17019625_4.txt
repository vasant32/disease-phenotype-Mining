Research examining autistic symptoms in Angelman syndrome (AS) is limited. The goal of this study was to further characterize the nature of stereotyped behaviors, social interaction deficits, and developmental disturbances in individuals with AS. Parents of 248 individuals between the ages of 3 and 22 completed a survey of autistic symptomatology by mail, the Gilliam Autism Rating Scale. Results confirmed a high degree of developmental delay and limited expressive language skills. In terms of stereotyped behaviors and social interaction, areas of convergence and divergence between AS and behaviors typically associated with autism spectrum disorders are described. The relationship between child characteristics (age, gender, seizure disorder, genetic subtype) and autistic symptomatology are discussed.
