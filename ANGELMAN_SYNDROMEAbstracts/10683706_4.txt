Caregivers of persons with Angelman syndrome completed the Aberrant Behavior Checklist and Reiss Screen for Maladaptive Behavior. Seventy-three replies were received, and comparisons were made with other published data. Responses indicated that 15q- Angelman syndrome is associated with such problems as lack of speech, overactivity, restlessness, and eating and sleep problems. Episodes of inappropriate laughter were only reported for 57%, despite being considered a cardinal feature of the syndrome; eating problems (64%) and a fascination with water (68%) were reported more frequently. Overactivity was more of a problem for children; Aberrant Behavior Checklist Factor IV (Hyperactivity) was negatively correlated with age. Scores were mostly lower than for previously studied etiological groups. Therapeutic effort should be put into programs to address these problems.
