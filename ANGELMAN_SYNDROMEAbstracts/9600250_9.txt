Angelman syndrome (AS) is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder. Recently, several mutations have been found in the E6-AP ubiquitin protein ligase gene (UBE3A) in a group of patients who are nondeleted and do not have uniparental disomy or imprinting defects. Most of the reported mutations cluster within exons 9 or 16 of the UBE3A gene, and nearly all are predicted to give rise to truncated E6-AP ligases. Here, we describe two AS patients with dissimilar phenotypes. At the molecular level, they are both nondeleted, do not display uniparental disomy, and have normal imprint patterns. One has the typical AS phenotype and carries the previously reported 1344delAG de novo mutation involving a functionally significant region of UBE3A. The other expresses an atypical phenotype in that she has less severe ataxia, no inappropriate laughing, or epilepsy, and her EEG was normal at an early age. A 14-bp deletion in the 3' untranslated region of exon 16 (3'UTRdel14) adjacent to the poly(A) signal was identified. Further investigation revealed that the DNA change was a neutral polymorphism. Haplotype analysis indicated that both the AS patient and her normal sibling had inherited the same maternal UBE3A gene and its 5' flanking region. Although the 14-bp change has no functional significance, it assists with counseling to determine future risks of recurrence in this family.
