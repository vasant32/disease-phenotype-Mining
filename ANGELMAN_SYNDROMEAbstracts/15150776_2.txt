Mutations have been found in the UBE3A gene (E6-AP ubiquitin protein ligase gene) in many Angelman syndrome (AS) patients with no deletion, no uniparental disomy, and no imprinting defect. UBE3A mutations are more frequent in familial than in sporadic patients and the mutations described so far seem to cause similar phenotypes in the familial affected cases. Here we describe two first cousins who have inherited the same UBE3A frameshift mutation (duplication of GAGG in exon 10) from their asymptomatic mothers but present discordant phenotypes. The proband shows typical AS features. Her affected cousin shows a more severe phenotype, with asymmetric spasticity that led originally to a diagnosis of cerebral palsy. Proband's brain MRI shows mild cerebral atrophy while her cousin's brain MRI shows severe brain malformation. This family demonstrates that, although brain malformation is unusual in AS, presence of a brain malformation does not exclude the diagnosis of AS. Also, this UBE3A mutation was transmitted from the cousin's grandfather to only two sisters among eight full siblings, raising the hypothesis of mosaicism for this mutation.
