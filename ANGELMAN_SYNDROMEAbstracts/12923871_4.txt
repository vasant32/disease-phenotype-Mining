Marker chromosomes originating from chromosome 15, often referred to as inv dup(15), is the most common marker chromosome found in humans. The large marker 15 that contains the Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS)/Angelman syndrome (AS) chromosome region is usually associated with an abnormal phenotype of moderate to severe mental retardation, seizures, poor motor coordination, behavioral problems, and mild dysmorphic features. We report here an infant boy with two copies of the large inv dup(15). A 10-day-old infant was found to have infantile spasms, microcephaly, hypotonia, and lethargy. Lymphocyte chromosome analysis revealed a 48,XY, +2mar karyotype. Fluorescence in situ hybridization with probes rRNA, D15Z4, D15S11, and GABRB3 demonstrated that both markers were chromosome 15 in origin and contained the Prader-Willi/Angelman syndrome chromosome region. Therefore, this patient is hexasomic for the PWS/AS region. The phenotype of this patient does not appear to be significantly more severe than patients with one copy of the large inv dup(15) at birth, however, follow-up evaluation of the patient at 21 months of age shows that this patient has frequent and severe seizure activity, severe bilateral hearing loss, and cortical blindness.
