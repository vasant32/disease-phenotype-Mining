We have developed a novel PCR-based method for studying DNA methylation in the proximal region of 15q, using restriction analysis after bisulfite treatment of genomic DNA. This protocol can be used for the diagnosis of Prader-Willi and Angelman syndromes. Unlike the recently reported methylation-specific PCR protocol, our method avoids the use of multiplex amplification, thus overcoming the need to adjust relative primer amounts and the risk of obtaining false-negative results.
