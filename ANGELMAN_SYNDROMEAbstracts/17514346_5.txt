Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) and Angelman syndrome (AS) result from the disturbance of imprinted gene expression within human chromosome 15q11-q13. Some cases of PWS and AS are caused by microdeletions near the SNRPN gene that disrupt a regulatory element termed the imprinting center (IC). The IC has two functional components; an element at the promoter of SNRPN involved in PWS (PWS-IC) and an element 35 kilobases (kb) upstream of SNRPN involved in AS (AS-IC). To further understand the function of the IC, we sought to create a mouse model for AS-IC mutations. We have generated two deletions at a location analogous to that of the human AS-IC. Neither deletion produced an imprinting defect as indicated by DNA methylation and gene expression analyses. These results indicate that no elements critical for AS-IC function in mouse reside within the 12.8-kb deleted region and suggest that the specific location of the AS-IC is not conserved between human and mouse.
