DNA replication kinetics of Prader-Willi/Angelman syndrome region of 15q11.2q12 was studied without synchronization in five human amniotic cell and five skin fibroblast strains with a marker 15 chromosome, i.e., 15p+ or der(15), as cytological marker to distinguish between the two homologs. BrdU-33258 Hoechst-Giemsa techniques were used to analyze and compare the late replication patterns in the 15q11.2q12 region between the homologs. Asynchronous replication between the homologs was observed in both amniocytes and fibroblasts. From cells of a marker 15 of known parental origin, the paternal 15q11.2q12 replicated earlier than that of the maternal 15 in 92%-95% of asynchronous metaphases. The remaining 5%-8% of asynchronous metaphases displayed maternal early/paternal late replication. This mosaic pattern of replication in the 15q11.2q12 region may be due to methylation mosaicism of genomic imprinting or a relative lack of self-control of replication. These results provide cytogenetic evidence of maternal imprinting and delayed replication in the 15q11.2q12 region.
