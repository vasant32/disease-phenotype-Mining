Imprinting of the Prader-Willi/Angelman syndrome region on human chromosome 15 is regulated by an imprinting centre (IC), which spans 5' exons of the gene encoding the small nuclear ribonucleoprotein N ( SNRPN ). The IC/ SNRPN transcripts are initiated at two alternative start sites, which share a high degree of sequence similarity with each other and with two newly identified sites 63 and >700 kb further upstream. Three of these sites are hypermethylated on the maternal chromosome, whereas one displays an oppositemethylation pattern. We have also identified novel splice variants of the IC/ SNRPN transcripts and hitherto undetected exons. One of these exons, which we designate u5, is deleted in all Angelman syndromepatients with a microdeletion of the IC. We conclude that elements of the IC region have undergone multiple duplication events and that u5 or a sequence close by may play a role in maternal imprinting.
