New antiepileptic drugs designed for enhancing GABAergic inhibition, such as vigabatrin (VGB) may be effective in Angelman syndrome (AS), because associated convulsions could be related to a reduced GABA-receptor density or receptor abnormality. From our preliminary experiences in four children with AS treated with VGB, we conclude that it may induce and increase seizures in patients with AS.
