The Prader-Willi (PWS) and Angelman syndromes (AS) share the same apparent cytogenetic and molecular lesions of 15q11-13 and yet exhibit distinct clinical phenotypes. The etiology of PWS or AS appears to depend on the parental origin of the aberrant chromosome 15. Substantial clinical overlap has not been reported between deletion-positive PWS and AS patients. In the present study, we report the clinical, cytogenetic, and molecular findings in three AS patients. The first patient is a mentally retarded woman with a visible deletion of 15q11-13 with typical craniofacial, behavioral, and neurologic changes of AS. This patient is hyperphagic, and she is moderately obese for her height. Her hands and feet are small. These manifestations are more characteristic of PWS and not of AS. The molecular studies showed deletions of maternal origin for five distal PWCR loci. The most proximal locus, D15S18, was not deleted. These findings are identical to those found in our third AS patient who does not have any PWS features. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of concurrence of hyperphagia with consequent obesity and the AS phenotype in a patient with a del 15(q11-13) of maternal origin. These clinical findings suggest that overlap in the symptoms of PWS and AS can occur. Our second AS patient presents with atypical molecular findings in that he cannot be classed into any of the three proposed sub-groups of AS patients and may be representative of a fourth sub-group of AS patients.
