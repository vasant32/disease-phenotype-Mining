Angelman and Prader-Willi syndromes are clinically distinct neurobehavioral disorders most commonly resulting from large deletions of chromosome 15q11-q13. The deletions arise differentially during maternal or paternal gametogenesis, respectively. A subgroup of patients with either syndrome have no apparent deletion, and because many such patients with Prader-Willi syndrome display inheritance of two copies of chromosome 15 from the mother only (uniparental disomy; UPD), we suggested that paternal UPD might be found in patients with Angelman syndrome. We report here clinical, cytogenetic, and molecular evidence on the 1 patient with paternal UPD for chromosome 15 who was found in our study population. This represents, to our knowledge, the first patient with paternal UPD to be studied with DNA probes from the chromosome 15q11-q13 critical region. In contrast to our findings for patients with Prader-Willi syndrome, in which maternal UPD was common, our data demonstrate that paternal UPD is infrequent in patients with Angelman syndrome.
