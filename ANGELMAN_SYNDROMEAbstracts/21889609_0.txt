Prader-Willi syndrome and Angelman syndrome are distinct neurodevelopmental disorders that are associated with the deletion of the chromosomal 15q11-13 region or uniparental disomy of chromosome 15. In this article, we applied SYBR Green I-based real-time PCR and melting curve analysis assay for rapid genotyping of the small nuclear ribonucleoprotein polypeptide N (SNRPN) gene methylation status and for detecting aberrations in copy number in a single tube. A single pair of primers was designed to create a 357 bp fragment containing the cytosine phosphodiester guanine islands in the SNRPN promoter and to amplify both unmethylated and methylated sequences. Genotypes were identified based on the TC value for copy number changes and the characteristic melting temperature of methylated cytosine phosphodiester guanine. Genotyping of SNRPN was performed on blood samples of 20 individuals with Prader-Willi syndrome, 3 individuals with Angelman syndrome, and 20 unaffected individuals. The promoter methylation status and the copy number changes were successfully determined and compared with standard methylation-specific PCR, and were validated by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. This single-tube, SYBR Green I, real-time PCR with melting curve assay is rapid, reliable, sensitive, and easy to perform. It is suitable for high-throughput analysis as an alternative technique for quantitative and qualitative analysis of target genes.
