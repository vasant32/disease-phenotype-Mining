Imprinted genes within the Prader-Willi/Angelman syndrome region of human chromosome 15q11-q13 are regulated by a mechanism involving allele-specific DNA methylation. Since transcriptional regulation by DNA methylation involves histone deacetylation, we explored whether differences in histone acetylation exist between the two parental alleles of SNRPN and other paternally expressed genes in the region by using a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay with antibodies against acetylated histones H3 and H4. SNRPN exon 1, which is methylated on the silent maternal allele, was associated with acetylated histones on the expressed paternal allele only. SNRPN intron 7, which is methylated on the paternal allele, was not associated with acetylated histones on either allele. The paternally expressed genes NDN, IPW, PWCR1 and MAGEL2 were not associated with acetylated histones on either allele. Treatment of the lymphoblastoid cells with trichostatin A, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, did not result in any changes to SNRPN expression or association of acetylated histones with exon 1. Treatment with 5-aza-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC), which inhibits DNA methylation, resulted in activation of SNRPN expression from the maternal allele, but was not accompanied by acetylation of histones. Our finding of allele-specific association of acetylated histones with the SNRPN exon 1 region, which encompasses the imprinting center, suggests that histone acetylation at this site may be important for regulation of SNRPN and of other paternally expressed genes in the region. On the silent allele, 5-aza-dC treatment altered SNRPN expression, but not association with acetylated histones, suggesting that histone acetylation is a secondary event in the process of gene reactivation by CpG demethylation.
