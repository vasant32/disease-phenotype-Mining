Carriers of either homologous or non-homologous acrocentric rearrangements are at an increased risk for aneuploidy, and, thus, for uniparental disomy (UPD). Abnormal phenotypes due to genomic imprinting are associated with UPD for the acrocentric chromosomes 14 and 15. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of UPD in a population with acrocentric rearrangements (either an isochromosome or a Robertsonian translocation) and abnormal phenotypes. Fifty individuals were studied. Of the 50 rearrangements, two were homologous rearrangements and both showed UPD. Forty-eight were non-homologous Robertsonian translocations, of which two showed UPD. This study demonstrates that UPD explains the abnormal phenotypes in some balanced carriers of acrocentric rearrangements. Our results and the large number of case reports in the literature suggest that patients with abnormal phenotypes and acrocentric rearrangements of chromosomes 14 or 15 should be tested for UPD.
