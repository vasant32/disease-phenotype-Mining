Sporadic cases of Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) are associated with the physical absence of the paternal Prader-Willi chromosome region (PWCR) by deletion 15q11-13, by segmental maternal heterodisomy or by chromosome rearrangements resulting in homozygosity for maternal PWCR. In isolated/familial cases, it is proposed that the expression of PWS depends on the functional absence caused by mutated gene(s) within the paternal PWCR. The same mutation on a maternally derived chromosome 15 is not able to express PWS. An epigenetic mechanism associated with the paternal meiosis is essential. In the Angelman syndrome (AS), inverse mechanisms are postulated. There is convincing evidence for specific PWS and AS genes or alleles within PWCR. This is compatible with the observations of interstitial chromosome deletions of the critical region in normal individuals or in probands with phenotypes other than PWS or AS. The new ideas of the model stated here are: (1) the proposed epigenetic mechanism in PWCR is obviously common in humans, but is usually of no phenotypic relevance; (2) interactions with specific chromosomal or gene mutations are required for the clinical expression of PWS or AS; (3) each factor alone is not able to produce an abnormal phenotype.
