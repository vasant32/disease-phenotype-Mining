A universally primed polymerase chain reaction was developed to amplify DNA dissected from GTG-banded human chromosomes. The amplification products are cloned into plasmid vectors, which allow the rapid characterization of recombinant clones. Starting from 20-40 chromosome fragments, several thousand independent clones detecting single-copy sequences can be obtained. Although these libraries comprise only a few percent of the dissected DNA, they provide narrowly spaced anchor clones for the molecular characterization of chromosome bands and the identification of gene sequences. Here we describe the construction and characterization of DNA libraries for the Langer-Giedion syndrome chromosome region (LGCR, 8q23-24.1), Wilms tumor chromosome region 1 (WT1, 11p13), Prader-Willi syndrome/Angelman syndrome chromosome region (PWCR/ANCR, 15q11.2-12), meningioma chromosome region (MGCR, 22q12-13), and fragile X chromosome region (FRAXA, Xq27.3).
