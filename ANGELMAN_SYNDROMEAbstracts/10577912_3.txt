Methylation analysis with probe PW71 (D15S63) is an established procedure to test patients suspected of having Prader-Willi syndrome or Angelman syndrome. Using this test, we have identified a 28-kb deletion spanning D15S63 in five independent families. Sequence analysis revealed identical breakpoints in all the families. The haplotype data are compatible with a common ancestral origin of the deletion in at least two families. The deletion was not found in 1, 000 unrelated controls. Although the deletion maps within the imprinting-center region, neither maternal nor paternal inheritance of the deletion appears to affect imprinting in proximal 15q. We conclude that the deletion is a rare neutral variant that can lead to false-positive results in the PW71-methylation test.
