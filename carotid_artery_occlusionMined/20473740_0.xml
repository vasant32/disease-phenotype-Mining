<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male C57BL/6J mice were randomly divided into 5 groups (10 animals/group): the sham group (0.5% CMC-Na, 20 mL/kg), the I/R model group (0.5% CMCNa, 20 mL/kg), the I/R+Crocin control group (20 mg/kg), the I/R+high dose WNK group (20 mg/kg), and the I/R+low dose WNK group (10 mg/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (BCCAO, 20 min) in mice, followed by 24 h reperfusion, was built </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The generation of nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO), the activity of nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (NOS), the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2 (ERK1/2), and the expression of matrix metalloproteinases-9 (MMP-9) and G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) in cortical microvascular homogenates were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The ultrastructural <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of cortical microvascular endothelial cells (CMEC) was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The transient global <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> (20 min), followed by 24 h of reperfusion, significantly promoted the generation of NO and the activity of NOS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The reperfusion led to serious <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> injuries in the cortical CMEC, as well as enhanced membrane GRK2 expression and reduced cytosol GRK2 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, enhanced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and decreased expression of MMP-9 were detected in cortical microvessels after I/R (20 min/24 h) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As well as the positive control Crocin (20 mg/kg, 21days), pre-treatment with WNK (20, 10 mg/kg, 21 days) markedly inhibited nitrative injury and modulated the ultrastructure of CMEC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, WNK inhibited GRK2 translocation from cytosol to the membrane (at 20 mg/kg) and reduced ERK1/2 phosphorylation and MMP-9 expression in cortical microvessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: WNK and its active compounds (Crocin) are effective to suppress I/R-induced vascular injury to cerebral microvessels after global <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> with the target on GRK2 pathways </plain></SENT>
