<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To present results of early angiographic diagnosis and endovascular treatment of traumatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> (TICA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From June 2002 to December 2006, diagnostic angiography was performed on patients with moderate to severe traumatic brain injury that involved a cranial base fracture or a penetrating brain injury with a tract from the penetrating agent that entered at the pterional area, went through the middle cerebral artery candelabra, and crossed the midline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>TICAs were treated by various endovascular techniques during the same angiographic procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-four patients with traumatic brain injury underwent angiography (25 penetrating brain injuries, nine blunt injuries); 13 TICAs were diagnosed (10 penetrating brain injuries, three blunt injuries) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Scale score at diagnosis ranged from 5 to 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Angiography was performed for screening in eight patients and for clinical indications in five patients; 11 TICAs were diagnosed before rupture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seven <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were located on branches of the middle cerebral artery, two on pericallosal branches of the anterior cerebral artery, and four on the internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No recanalization was detected in 12 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One patient treated with a bare stent and coiling had a growing intracavernous pseudoaneurysm; therefore, internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> with extracranial-intracranial microvascular bypass was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Six patients refused angiographic follow-up, but computed tomographic angiography has failed to show recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No patient presented with delayed <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> (mean follow-up, 2.6 yr) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were no procedure-related complications or mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Early angiographic diagnosis with immediate endovascular treatment provided an effective approach for TICA detection and management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Endovascular therapy is versatile and offers a valuable alternative to surgery, allowing early <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> exclusion with excellent results </plain></SENT>
