<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>Seizures</z:hpo> were produced by 20 consecutive electroshocks, and ischemic neuronal damage was produced by a 30-minute period of combined right common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Horseradish peroxidase was used to evaluate blood-brain barrier permeability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serial 1micronm.sections showed an ateriole within most foci of horseradish peroxidase extravasation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were areas of brain in both experimental groups in which the only permeable vessels were arterioles, and in one ischemic animal, the only permeable vessels were arterioles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pinocytotic activity was determined in capillaries and arterioles and expressed as the number of horseradish peroxidase-containing pinocytotic vesicles per square millimeter of endothelial cytoplasmic area +/- standard error </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The pinocytotic activity in capillaries and arterioles, respectively, was 12.2 +/- 5.4 and 6.7 +/- 3.0 in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rats, 86.7 +/- 22.1 and 267 +/- 46.1 after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, and 52.7 +/- 10.6 and 91.2 +/- 33.2 following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results indicate the importance of the arterioles in maintaining and altering the blood-brain barrier and suggest that abnormal blood-brain barrier permeability occurs first within the arteriole </plain></SENT>
