<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In view of the described anti-oxidative actions of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">DFO</z:chebi> and the anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory effects of EPO, we hypothesized that the combination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">DFO</z:chebi> and EPO would increase neuroprotection after neonatal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0752304" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoxic-ischemic brain injury</z:e> as compared to single <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">DFO</z:chebi> or EPO treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At postnatal day 7 rats underwent right common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> followed by a 90-min exposure to 8% oxygen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rats were treated intraperitoneally with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">DFO</z:chebi> (200mg/kg), recombinant human EPO (1 kU/kg), a combination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">DFO</z:chebi>-EPO or vehicle at 0, 24 and 48 h after <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (HI) and were sacrificed at 72 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">DFO</z:chebi>-EPO administration reduced the number of cleaved caspase 3-positive cells in the ipsilateral cerebral cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Early neuronal damage was assessed by staining for microtubuli-associated protein (MAP)-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In our model 63+/-9% loss of ipsilateral MAP-2 was observed after HI, indicating extensive brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">DFO</z:chebi>, EPO or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">DFO</z:chebi>-EPO treatment did not improve neuronal integrity as defined by MAP-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cerebral white matter tracts were stained for myelin basic protein (MBP), a constituent of myelin </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Although <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">DFO</z:chebi>-EPO treatment reduced the number of cleaved caspase 3(+) cells, treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">DFO</z:chebi>, EPO, or with the combination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">DFO</z:chebi> and EPO did not protect against gray or white matter damage in the experimental setting applied </plain></SENT>
