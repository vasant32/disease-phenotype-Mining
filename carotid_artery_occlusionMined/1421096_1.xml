<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using the same animal model, we attempted to show that this effect of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29864">mannitol</z:chebi> could be traced (via an improvement in cerebral blood flow) to a tempering of the collapse in the high-energy phosphates that occurs during the insult </plain></SENT>
