<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Molecular imaging of therapeutic interventions with targeted agents that simultaneously carry drugs or genes for local delivery is appealing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the ability of a novel microbubble carrier (immunobubble) for abciximab, a <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitor, for ultrasonographic molecular imaging of human clots </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> were incubated with immunobubbles conjugated with abciximab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Control clots were incubated in either saline or with immunobubbles conjugated with nonspecific antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We evaluated immunobubble suspensions with variable concentrations of encapsulated gas and measured mean acoustic intensity of the incubated clots </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In vivo molecular imaging of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> with abciximab immunobubbles was evaluated in a rat model of carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean acoustic intensity was significantly higher for abciximab immunobubbles as compared with control immunobubbles under <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> conditions tested with maximum difference in intensity at a gas volume of 0.2 microL (P=0.0013 for mechanical index 0.05, P=0.0001 for mechanical index 0.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Binding of abciximab immunobubbles to clots in vitro led to enhanced echogenicity dependent on bubble concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In vivo ultrasonic detectability of carotid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> was significantly higher for clots targeted with abciximab immunobubbles (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Quantification of in vivo contrast enhancement displayed a highly significant increment for abciximab immunobubble-targeted clots compared with nonspecific immunobubble-targeted clots (P&lt;0.0001) and to native clots (P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the feasibility of using a therapeutic agent for selective targeting in vascular imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Abciximab immunobubbles improve visualization of human clots both in vitro and in an in vivo model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> arterial thrombotic occlusion </plain></SENT>
