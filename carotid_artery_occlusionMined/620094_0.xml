<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results were compared with those produced by intravenous influsion of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="33569">noradrenaline</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>2 Nitroprusside and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6942">minoxidil</z:chebi> attenuated the pressor responses produced by carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>3 Nitroprusside, but not <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6942">minoxidil</z:chebi>, attenuated the maximal myocardial contractility resulting from carotid occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>4 The pressor and contractility responses to <z:chebi fb="15" ids="33569">noradrenaline</z:chebi> infusion were unaffected by either agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>5 Nitroprusside failed to alter the myocardial responses produced by dimethylphenylpiperazinium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>6 These results, in conjunction with those of other investigators who have demonstrated that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7596">nitroprusside</z:chebi> does not affect the release of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="33569">noradrenaline</z:chebi> from adrenergic neurons, suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7596">nitroprusside</z:chebi> may inhibit sympathetic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system reflex activity via an afferent and/or central component </plain></SENT>
