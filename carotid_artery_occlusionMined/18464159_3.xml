<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Young (three to six months) and aged (19-22 months) male Brown Norway Fisher rats were used to compare (i) leukocyte function in nonischemic conditions and (ii) leukocyte function and hemodynamic changes after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion (I-R) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In nonischemic studies, polymorphonuclear (PMN) CD11b expression and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production were measured with flow cytometry and PMN chemotaxis was measured with a Boyden chamber (+/-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53490">fMLP</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In I-R studies, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was induced by bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> (20 minutes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During early reperfusion (30 minutes), leukocyte <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> and rolling and blood-shear rates were measured using fluorescence microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During late reperfusion (48 hours), mortality, neurological function, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002498'>leukocyte infiltration</z:mp> were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Stimulated PMN chemotaxis was increased in nonischemic aged rats (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In early reperfusion, there was a significant increase in leukocyte rolling and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> in the cerebral microcirculation and a significant decrease in shear rate in aged rats, compared to the young (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During late reperfusion, neurologic function was worse in aged vs. young rats (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that increased intravascular PMN <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> and vascular dysfunction may contribute to poor neurologic outcome after cerebral I-R in the aged brain </plain></SENT>
