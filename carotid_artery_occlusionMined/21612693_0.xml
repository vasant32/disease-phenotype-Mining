<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From January 2001 to January 2010, 56 carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> patients with contralateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> were performed CAS and the feature and results of these cases were analyzed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the cases were confirmed to be carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> with contralateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> by digital subtraction angiography (DSA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The diameter stenosis rate was 72% ± 15% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CAS were performed with distal protection device in 56 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The technique success rate of CAS were 100% in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the 56 patients with contralateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and post-procedure stenosis rate descended to 13% ± 8%, and the symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only 1 case occurred remote <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> in the position of previous <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> in the side of CAS after the procedure, and recovered with light neurological deficit after the craniotomy to remove the <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No ischemic complications or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During the following up of 6 months to 3 years, no cerebral ischemic symptoms reoccurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The rechecking results of color Doppler of 47 cases and DSA of 2 cases showed no restenosis in-stent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CAS is safe and effective for the patients with contralateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Critical election of the case, operation of skilled doctors and scrupulous postprocedure general management can decrease the rate of complication </plain></SENT>
