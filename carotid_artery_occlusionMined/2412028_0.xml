<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Vascular 5-HT2-receptor blockade, resulting in inhibition of <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi>-induced vasoconstriction and amplification of other vasoconstrictors, has been suggested by some investigators, but others have concluded that vascular alpha-adrenoceptor blockade is responsible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In our experiments using <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7983">pentobarbitone</z:chebi>-anaesthetized dogs, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6123">ketanserin</z:chebi> (0.1-0.4 mg/kg i.v.) produced immediate and sustained <z:hpo ids='HP_0002527'>falls</z:hpo> in systemic arterial blood pressure and vascular resistance in the common carotid and femoral arterial circulations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Constrictor responses to <z:chebi fb="15" ids="33569">noradrenaline</z:chebi> in these circulations were unaffected by 0.1-0.4 mg/kg i.v. of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6123">ketanserin</z:chebi>; alpha-adrenoceptor blockade was only produced by higher doses (1-4 mg/kg i.v.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Constrictor responses in the common carotid circulation to preganglionic cervical sympathetic nerve stimulation and to <z:chebi fb="164" ids="18723">nicotine</z:chebi> were not inhibited by 0.1-0.4 mg/kg of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6123">ketanserin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The systemic pressor responses to <z:chebi fb="164" ids="18723">nicotine</z:chebi> and common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, however, were reduced by these doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6123">ketanserin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that alpha-adrenoceptor blockade is not responsible for the hypotensive action of 0.1-0.4 mg/kg of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6123">ketanserin</z:chebi>, and that a centrally mediated inhibition of sympathetic nerve activity is involved </plain></SENT>
