<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: NF-kappaB is a transcription factor that regulates inflammatory and apoptotic pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We described previously that intraperitoneal administration of the NF-kappaB inhibitor TAT-NBD at 0 and 3 hours after neonatal <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (HI) markedly reduced brain damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that timing and duration of NF-kappaB inhibition will be a major factor in determining outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: HI was induced in P7 rats by unilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In vivo TAT-NBD effects were determined on cerebral damage, NF-kappaB activity, cytokine expression, and pro- and antiapoptotic molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In vitro effects of TAT-NBD were determined using primary neurons and cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: HI induced 2 peaks of cerebral NF-kappaB activity at 3 to 6 and 24 hours after HI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neuroprotective 0/3-hour TAT-NBD treatment only inhibited early NF-kappaB activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, inhibition of both early and late NF-kappaB-activity by 0/6/12-hour TAT-NBD or only late NF-kappaB activity by 18/21-hour TAT-NBD aggravated damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>0/6/12-hour TAT-NBD did not prevent HI-induced upregulation of cytokines at 24 hours after HI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Protective 0/3-hour TAT-NBD treatment prevented nuclear accumulation of p53 at 24 hours after HI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Nuclear p53 was not reduced after 0/6/12-hour TAT-NBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Prolonged TAT-NBD increased the proapoptotic factor PUMA and reduced the antiapoptotic factors Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Also in neuronal cultures prolonged TAT-NBD exposure overruled protective short-term TAT-NBD treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Early NF-kappaB activation contributes to neonatal HI brain damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Late NF-kappaB provides endogenous neuroprotection and upregulates antiapoptotic molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of early NF-kappaB activity is neuroprotective only when late NF-kappaB activity is maintained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Moreover, cerebral cytokine production can occur independently of NF-kappaB </plain></SENT>
