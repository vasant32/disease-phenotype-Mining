<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Occlusion of the internal carotid artery in the extracranial segment was found in 19 patients, at the bifurcation in 11 and at the cervical level in 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>While in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phase of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in the cervical segment is an uncommon angiographic finding, we found a high frequency of occlusion at this level (8 out of 19) in our patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cervical segment occlusion may be due to a dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> or to an intracranial carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (embolic or atherothrombotic) with subsequent migration of the clot down to this level </plain></SENT>
