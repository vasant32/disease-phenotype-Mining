<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present the results of eight patients who underwent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography of the cervical carotids and circle of Willis, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging of the brain and dynamic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> perfusion studies before and after the injection of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23018">carbonic anhydrase inhibitor</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients showed increased transit times in the symptomatic hemisphere at rest indicating reduced flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The transit time asymmetries became more pronounced after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients because of failed vasodilatation on the affected side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was an inverse correlation between the degree of increased transit time and the degree of collateralisation around the circle of Willis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We believe that demonstration of both macroscopic vascular <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> and microvascular reserve is important when assessing patients with possible low-flow states and the described method is a robust means of obtaining that data </plain></SENT>
