<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Overproduction of free radical species has been shown to occur in brain tissues after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, most of free radical scavengers known to antagonize oxidative damage (e.g. <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase, catalase), are unable to protect against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion brain injury when given in vivo, an effect mainly due to their difficulty to gain access to brain tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we studied the effect of a low molecular weight <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase mimetic (M40401) in brain damage subsequent to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion injury in Mongolian gerbils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In animals undergoing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion injury, neuropathological and ultrastructural changes were monitored for 1-7 days either in the presence or in the absence of M40401 after bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (BCCO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Administration of M40401 (1-40 mg/kg, given i.p </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>1 h after BCCO) protected against post-ischemic, ultrastructural and neuropathological changes occurring within the hippocampal CA1 area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The protective effect of M40401 was associated with a significant reduction of the levels of malondialdehyde (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>; a marker of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation) in ischemic brain tissues after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Taken together, these results demonstrate that M40401 provides protective effects when given early after the induction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion of brain tissues and suggest the possible use of such compounds in the treatment of neurological dysfunction subsequent to cerebral flow disturbances </plain></SENT>
