<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A method is described to enable the recording of transient intracellular calcium changes in deep brain structures in anesthetized and awake animals using a fluorescent indicator combined with in vivo optical detection methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Optrodes were fabricated using a bifurcated fiber-optic cable with an attached infusion guide cannula </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After intracranial implantation of an optrode, animals were prepared in the following manner, (1) rats (intra-striatal) and monkeys (intra-putamen) were infused with the fluorescent calcium indicator, Oregon Green, to load intrinsic cells; or (2) rats were intra-striatally transplanted with a slurry of dye-loaded IMR-32 <z:hpo ids='HP_0003006'>neuroblastoma</z:hpo> cells via pipette ejection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Excitation light from an <z:chebi fb="17" ids="49474,49475">argon</z:chebi>-ion laser was launched through the optrode and passed into the tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The resulting calcium-induced fluorescence signals were captured by the optrode, then detected and processed by externalized photomultiplier- and CCD-based spectrometer electronics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In approximately 25% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> intrinsic cell recordings, the baseline fluorescence intensity was relatively stable over time whereas in the remainder, large amplitude oscillations were observed with a frequency in the range of 0.5-2 Hz </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These Ca(2+) transients were inhibited by local infusion of 10 microM omega-conotoxin MVIIC and 1 microM <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9506">TTX</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Extracellular electrophysiological recordings that were made adjacent to the optrode tip revealed that the Ca(2+) oscillations were in phase with the burst firing of striatal neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This suggested that the optical signals had a neuronal origin, most likely from medium spiny neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Baseline fluorescence intensity increased during infusion of high [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi>](o), the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22986">calcium ionophore</z:chebi>, A-23187, or during temporary bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Monkey (Saimiri sciureus) putamen recordings also affirmed the presence of similar calcium-related transients in a non-human primate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the transplant preparations, the IMR-32 cells displayed a stable, non-oscillating baseline fluorescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>They were similarly responsive to high [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi>](o) challenge and appeared viable for at least several hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Similar optical recording approaches might be applied to monitor other fluorescent, chemiluminescent or bioluminescent events from almost any brain structure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Moreover, transplanted transfected cells expressing a single specific receptor or ion-channel protein may effectively serve as biosensing elements for the measurement of extracellular neurochemical signaling </plain></SENT>
