<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Several previous studies have reported the benefits of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) contralateral to carotid occlusion with mixed results, but none of these were randomized except for the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to analyze the results of surgery in patients with contralateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in a randomized trial in which randomization was done according to the method of closure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 399 CEAs (357 patients) that were randomized into primary closure versus patching, 49 had contralateral occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Strokes</z:hpo> were designated as ipsilateral if they arose from the same CEA side and contralateral if they arose from the occluded side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to estimate perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-free survival in patients with contralateral occlusion (group A) versus those without contralateral occlusion (group B) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Demographic characteristics and mean follow-up for both groups were similar (group A, 40 months; group B, 33 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Group A had a higher incidence of contralateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo>) (12.2% versus 0.9%; P&lt;0.0001), contralateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> (2% versus 0%; P=0.025), and combined contralateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> (14.3% versus 0.9%; P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The rates for perioperative and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> (operative and late) were 2% and 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>1% (2% ipsilateral and 2% contralateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>) for group A and 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>9% and 3.4% (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ipsilateral) for group B (P=0.60 and 0.85, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The rates for perioperative and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> were 0% and 14.3% for group A versus 2.6% and 6.3% for group B (P=0.918 and P=0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>08, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The rates for perioperative and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> neurological events (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>) were 2% and 18.4% for group A and 5.4% and 9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>7% for group B (P=0.27 and 0.113, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The cumulative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-free survival rates at 5 years were 84% for group A and 77% for group B (P&gt;0.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The cumulative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-free survival rates at 5 years for symptomatic and asymptomatic patients in group A and group B were also similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The perioperative and late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were similar for both groups (group A, 8%; group B, 14%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Group A had a higher incidence of contralateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> than group B; however, the perioperative and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> late <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rates and survival rates of CEA were comparable in patients with and without contralateral occlusion </plain></SENT>
