<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We examined the potential importance of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi>-mediated alterations in energy metabolism in providing protection against hypoxic-ischemic brain damage in immature rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Seven-day-old rats (n = 165) that had been treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> (0.1 mg/kg, i.p.) or vehicle were assigned to control or hypoxic-ischemic groups (unilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> plus 2-3 h of 8% oxygen at normothermia) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The systemic availability of alternate fuels such as beta-hydroxybutyrate, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi>, and free fatty acids was not altered by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> treatment, and, except for <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, brain levels were also unaffected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At the end of <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>, levels of cerebral high-energy phosphates (ATP and phosphocreatine) were decreased in vehicle- but relatively preserved in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi>-treated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The local cerebral metabolic rate of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> utilization (lCMRgl) was decreased modestly under control conditions in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi>-treated animals, whereas cerebral energy use measured in a model of decapitation <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> did not differ significantly between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The lCMRgl increased markedly during <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (p &lt; 0.05) and remained elevated throughout <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi>- but not vehicle-treated groups, indicating an enhanced glycolytic flux with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> likely provides protection against hypoxic-ischemic damage in immature rats by preserving cerebral ATP secondary to a maintenance of glycolytic flux </plain></SENT>
