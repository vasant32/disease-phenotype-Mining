<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Analysis of neurotrophins <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression is an appropriate tool to assess therapeutic efficiency of the anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have analyzed the effect of synthetic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> semax and its C-terminal Pro-Gly-Pro <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47923">tripeptide</z:chebi> upon <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> expression of neurotrophins Ngf, Bdrf, Nt-3 and their receptors TrkA, TrkB, TrkC, p75 in rat frontal lobes, hippocampus and cerebellum after bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The animals were decapitated 30 min, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24 h after the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of neurotrophins and their receptors was assessed by relative quantification using real-time RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our showed that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> causes a significant decrease in gene expression in the hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Semax and PGP affected the expression of neurotrophins and their receptors predominantly in the frontal cortex and hippocampus of the ischemized animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the frontal cortex, Semax treatment resulted in a decrease of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level of receptors, while PGP treatment increased the level of these <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Maximal neuroprotective effect of both <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> has been observed in the hippocampus 12 h after occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A decrease of gene expression of neurotrophins and their receptors caused by the occlusion was overcome by Semax and PGP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results clarify the semax mechanism of and present certain features of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>'s expression of neurotrophins and their receptors in experimental conditions </plain></SENT>
