<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Although the results of the Asymptomatic Carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>Atherosclerosis</z:hpo> Study clearly demonstrated the benefit of surgical over medical management of severe carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp>, the results for women in particular were less certain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This was to some extent because of the higher perioperative complication rate observed in the 281 women (3.6% vs 1.7% in men) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to review a large experience with carotid endarterectomy in female patients and to determine whether the perioperative results differed from those of male patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A review was conducted of a prospectively compiled database on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> carotid endarterectomies performed between 1982 and 1997 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Operations performed in 991 female patients were compared with those performed in 1485 male patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Female patients had a significantly lower incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo>, and contralateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> than did male patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Female patients had a significantly higher incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in the age, smoking history, <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anesthetic</z:chebi> route, shunt use, or clamp tolerance between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of 991 female patients, 659 (66.5%) had preoperative symptoms, whereas 332 (33.5%) cases were performed for asymptomatic stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among 1485 male patients, 1041 (70.1%) had symptoms, and 444 (29.9%) were symptom free before surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences noted in the perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rates between men and women overall (2.3% vs 2.4%, P =.92), or when divided into symptomatic (2.5% vs 3.0%, P =.52) and asymptomatic (2.0% vs 1.2%, P =.55) cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Carotid endarterectomy can be performed with equally low perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rates in men and women in both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In this series, symptom-free female patients had the lowest overall <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The concerns of the Asymptomatic Carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>Atherosclerosis</z:hpo> Study regarding the benefit of carotid endarterectomy in female patients should therefore not prevent clinicians from recommending and performing carotid endarterectomy in appropriately selected symptom-free female patients </plain></SENT>
