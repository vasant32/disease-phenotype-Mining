<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we provide evidence for the protective effect of PARP inhibition on degenerative <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> damage induced by bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (BCCAO), an adequate <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> hypoperfusion murine model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found that BCCAO in adult male Wistar rats led to severe degeneration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> layers that was attenuated by a carboxaminobenzimidazol-derivative PARP inhibitor (HO3089) administered unilaterally into the vitreous body immediately following carotid occlusion and then 4 times in a 2-week-period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> morphological structure of the retina was preserved and the thickness of the <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> layers was increased in HO3089-treated eyes compared to the BCCAO eyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For Western blot studies, HO3089 was administered immediately after BCCAO and retinas were removed 4 h later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>According to Western blot analysis utilizing phosphorylation-specific primary antibodies, besides activating poly-<z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="33942">ribose</z:chebi> (PAR) synthesis, BCCAO induced phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase (MAPK) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>HO3089 inhibited PAR synthesis, and decreased the phosphorylation of these proapoptotic MAPKs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, HO3089 treatment induced phosphorylation, that is activation, of the protective Akt/<z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthase kinase (GSK)-3beta and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) signaling pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that PARP activation has a major role in mediating <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> hypoperfusion-induced neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, and inhibition of the enzyme prevents the pathological changes both in the <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and the kinase signaling cascades involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results identify PARP inhibition as a possible molecular target in the clinical management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> hypoperfusion-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegenerative diseases</z:hpo> including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1321558" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ocular ischemic syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
