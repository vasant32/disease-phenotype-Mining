<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was designed to examine the beneficial effects of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35457">ACE inhibitors</z:chebi> on microcirculation and metabolism in the ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>Cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was developed for 60 minutes in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR, n = 35) by bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="35457">ACE inhibitor</z:chebi> (0.1 or 10 mg/kg SQ 29,852 or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3380">captopril</z:chebi>) were intravenously injected 15 minutes before <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow to the parietal cortex was measured with the H2 clearance technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">Lactate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi>, and ATP in the brain were estimated by the enzymatic method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Before <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, high doses of both SQ 29,852 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3380">captopril</z:chebi> significantly <z:mp ids='MP_0004876'>decreased mean arterial pressure</z:mp> by 15 to 25 mm Hg and reduced cerebral vascular resistance by 13% to 17% of the resting values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow and arterial pressure during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> were not altered by these <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35457">ACE inhibitors</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After 60 minutes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, tissue <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> in vehicle-treated SHR increased 6.6-fold and ATP decreased to 65% of the control values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Administration of SQ 29,852 or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3380">captopril</z:chebi> significantly reduced the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> levels to 1.6- to 3.1-fold and well preserved the ATP levels to 82% to 93% of the control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that inhibition of ACE activities may be protective for cerebral metabolism against ischemic insult </plain></SENT>
