<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To describe the spectral and color Doppler imaging findings in 2 cases of internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> with vasa vasorum collateral flow, which we term the "pseudostring sign." METHODS: Spectral and color Doppler imaging findings in both cases were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance angiography in 2 cases and conventional angiography in 1 case were also reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both patients had color Doppler images showing that the internal carotid artery was a narrow, stringlike vessel with arterial flow that had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> spectral Doppler features (velocity &lt; 125 cm/s with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> waveform) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance angiography in 1 patient showed total occlusion of the proximal internal carotid artery with patent vasa vasorum collaterals reconstituting the lumen distally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the second patient, magnetic resonance angiography showed total occlusion of the proximal internal carotid artery, and conventional angiography showed proximal occlusion with collateral flow through the vasa vasorum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Proximal internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> with vasa vasorum collateral flow should be considered when color Doppler imaging shows a seemingly narrow internal carotid artery with tortuosity and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> spectral Doppler features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with these features should not undergo carotid endarterectomy directly on the basis of only the Doppler findings </plain></SENT>
