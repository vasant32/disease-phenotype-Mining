<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Cyclin G1 (CG1) was identified as a p53-transactivated target gene, and yet its physiological and pathological roles have been unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we demonstrate that CG1 is translocated from cytoplasm to the nuclei of neurons in response to variety of injuries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> matured rodent brain, CG1 immunoreactivity was hardly observed; however, some brain injuries exhibited intense CG1 immunoreactivity in the nuclei of the damaged neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transient common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (CCAO) in the gerbil showed strong CG1-like immunoreactivity in the hippocampal CA1 neurons, and permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in the mouse showed strong CG1-like immunoreactivity in the nuclei of neurons located in the ischemic brain regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>TUNEL staining did not exactly overlap with the CG1-positive cells, but overlapped highly with Fluoro-Jade B staining, a degeneration marker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Brain trauma caused by knife cut, cold injury, and kinate injection also showed CG1 accumulation in the neuronal nuclei located near the injury site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These observations were obtained in p53-deficient mice as well, suggesting that the accumulation of CG1 in the injured neurons is p53-independent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A similar nuclear translocation of endogenous CG1 was confirmed in a primary culture of cortical neurons when a toxic level of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">N-methyl-D-aspartate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi>) was applied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that nuclear translocation of CG1 from cytoplasmic region occurs in damaged and degenerating neurons in a p53-independent manner, and the CG1 nuclear staining could be a good marker for the neurons received fatal damages </plain></SENT>
