<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Intravenous (IV) thrombolysis with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) has demonstrated favorable clinical outcomes in a 3-6 h window in patients selected with perfusion/diffusion mismatch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the advantages of combined IV and intraarterial (IA) thrombolysis after 3 h of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> are unexplored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients with persistent occlusion of intracranial large arteries were screened prospectively for thrombolysis by evaluating perfusion/diffusion mismatch on MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The IV rt-PA was initiated within 3-6 h, and additional urokinase (UK) was then administered via the IA route after angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Four patients had middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and one patient had an internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median time from the symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> to the initiation of IV therapy and to the initiation of IA treatment was 215 +/- 30 min and 292 +/- 41 min, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) scores were as follows: initial, 13; immediately after IA treatment, 8; at 24 h, 5; and at 7 days, 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The Thrombolysis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>Myocardial Infarction</z:hpo> (TIMI) score after the completion of thrombolysis was 2-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Four patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> recovered completely or exhibited mild disability and one patient with <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> also demonstrated a favorable outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This preliminary result suggests that if a significant perfusion/diffusion mismatch on MRI is identified, a sequential combination thrombolysis of IV rt-PA and IA UK is potentially beneficial in moderate to severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients who are treated within 3-6 h after symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
