<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the association between the NRILN and an aberrant right subclavian artery has been reported, to date there have been no reports describing cases of NRILN with multiple <z:hpo ids='HP_0002597'>vascular abnormalities</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The right NRILN was found during a total thyroidectomy with surrounding lymph node dissection </plain></SENT>
