<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>With demonstration of the failure of extracranial-intracranial (EC-IC) bypass to reduce the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in patients with internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion, controversy continues regarding the best method of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> prevention in these high-risk persons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One approach, endarterectomy of stenotic lesions of the contralateral carotid bifurcation, has been used for 145 patients with ICA occlusion during the past 25 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Presenting symptoms included focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo>) in 62 patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="46274">CVA</z:chebi>) in 57, and nonfocal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> in 16 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ten patients were asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nine patients (6.2%) sustained perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, only three of which were ipsilateral to the endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were three perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (2.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During the follow-up period (mean 4 years) there were 13 new <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> (9.2%), four of which were fatal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These late results compare favorably with patients from the cooperative study of EC-IC bypass with occlusion of one ICA, whether they received surgical treatment or were managed nonoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>With the exception of select situations where an occluded ICA may be reopened, we conclude that the best current therapy for these patients is close observation of the nonoccluded ICA and endarterectomy once a stenotic lesion is encountered </plain></SENT>
