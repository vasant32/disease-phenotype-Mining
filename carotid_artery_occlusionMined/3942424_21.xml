<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirty-four patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> documented at the time of emergency endarterectomy were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Before operation, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these patients had profound neurological deficits including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was a 94% success rate in restoring patency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In follow-up, nine patients (26.5%) had a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> neurological exam, four (11.8%) had a minimal deficit, 10 (29.4%) had a moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo>, which was improved over their preoperative deficit, 4 (11.8%) remained hemiplegic, and seven (20.6%) died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The natural history of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> carotid occlusion and profound neurological deficits is dismal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In comparison, 13 patients (38%) made a dramatic recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The surgical mortality rate compares favorably with the natural history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Good collateral flow was a good prognostic factor, while a simultaneous middle cerebral artery <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> was associated with a poorer prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>An emergency carotid endarterectomy may be indicated in selected patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> with profound neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Full preoperative angiography may identify those patients who would benefit from surgical intervention and reduce the operative mortality rate </plain></SENT>
