<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The external carotid artery (ECA) is an important collateral pathway for cerebral blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Carotid artery stenting (CAS) typically crosses the ECA, while carotid endarterectomy (CEA) includes deliberate ECA plaque removal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present study was to compare the long-term patency of the ECA following CAS and CEA as determined by carotid duplex ultrasound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Duplex ultrasounds and hospital records were reviewed for consecutive patients undergoing CAS between February 2002 and April 2008, and were compared with those undergoing CEA in the same time period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Preoperative and postoperative ECA peak systolic velocities were normalized to the common carotid artery (CCA) as ECA/CCA ratios </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A significant (80% or greater) ECA stenosis was defined as an ECA/CCA ratio of 4.0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A change of ratio by more than 1 was defined as significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Data were analyzed using Student's t test and Ï‡(2) analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 86 CAS procedures in 83 patients were performed (81 men, mean age 69.9 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among them, 38.4% of patients had previous CEA, 9.6% of whom had contralateral internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Sixty-seven CAS and 65 CEA patients with complete duplex data in the same time period were included in the analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in the incidence of severe ECA stenosis on preoperative ultrasound evaluations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>During a mean follow-up of 34 months (range four to 78 months), three postprocedure ECA occlusions were found in the CAS group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The likelihood of severe stenosis or occlusion following CAS was 28.3%, compared with 11% following CEA (P&lt;0.025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>However, 62% of CEA patients and 57% of CAS patients had no significant change in ECA status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Reduction in the patient's degree of ECA stenosis was observed in 9.4% of CAS versus 26.6% of CEA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Overall, immediate postoperative ratios of both groups were slightly improved, but there was a trend of more disease progression in the CAS group during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CAS is associated with a higher incidence of post-procedure ECA stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Despite the absence of neurological symptoms, a trend toward late disease progression of ECA following CAS warrants long-term evaluation </plain></SENT>
