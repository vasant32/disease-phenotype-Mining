<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Pressure transients resulting from square-wave changes in abdominal aortic blood flow rate were used to derive effective arterial compliance and peripheral resistance of the hind-limb circulation of anaesthetized rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The model for deriving these parameters proved applicable if step changes in flow were kept less than 35% of mean flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Under resting conditions, the effective hind-limb arterial compliance of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rabbits averaged 3.46 X 10(-3) mL/mmHg (1 mmHg = 133.322 Pa) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hind-limb arterial compliance decreased with increasing pressure at low arterial pressures, but unlike compliance of isolated arterial segments, compliance did not vary at and above <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> resting pressures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Baroreflex destimulation (bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>) caused an increase in effective hind-limb vascular resistance at 48.4% and a decrease of arterial compliance of 50.7%, so that the constant for flow-induced arterial pressure changes (resistance times compliance) was largely unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similarly, the arterial time constant for rabbits with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> was similar to that for controls because threefold increases in hind-limb vascular resistance were offset by decreases in compliance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Reflex-induced decreases in arterial compliance are probably mediated by sympathetic nerves, whereas decreases associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> are related to wall <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> in conjunction with increased vasomotor tone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Arterial compliance decreased with increasing pressure in hypertensive animals, but this effect was less pronounced than in normotensive rabbits </plain></SENT>
