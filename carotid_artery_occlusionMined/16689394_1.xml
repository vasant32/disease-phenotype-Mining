<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The right internal carotid artery was completely involved in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because the right carotid siphon was relatively nontortuous stent-assisted coiling of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was attempted 4 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A new coil-type coronary stent, a DRIVER stent, was deployed after microcatheter insertion into the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> dome under systemic heparinization, followed by dome packing using Guglielmi detachable coils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Systemic heparinization was continued for 18 hours postoperatively, and aspirin (100 mg/day) was administered orally immediately after the embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, 4 hours after <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> administration cessation, left <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> became apparent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immediate magnetic resonance angiography revealed a right internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Diffusion-weighted images demonstrated ischemic spots in the watershed zones of the right cerebral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Following an immediate thrombolysis of the right internal carotid artery, systemic heparinization was continued for 5 days, and aspirin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9588">ticlopidine</z:chebi> were administrated orally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The patient was discharged on day 37, following the recovery from left <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> within ten days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A DRIVER stent is a low profile coil-type coronary stent, which can be used for the stent-assisted coiling of large internal carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, located distal to the carotid siphon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It seems necessary to continue systemic heparinization for more than 2 days and to administer increased dose or two types of antiplatelet after the stent-assisted coiling of large <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
