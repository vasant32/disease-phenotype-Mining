<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One possible long-term complication of this procedure is "de novo" formation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this paper is to estimate the incidence of de novo <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> formation, the time period between occlusion and formation, and the most common sites of formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A PubMed search was performed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> articles between 1970 and 2008 reporting cases of both therapeutic carotid occlusion and de novo <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 20 papers reviewed reported 187 patients having undergone therapeutic carotid occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the 163 patients reported in complete-case series, seven developed new <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> (4.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirty-six total new <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were reported, ranging from 1 to 5 per patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The average time period between occlusion and detection of de novo <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was 9.1 years (range: 2 to 20 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> occurred mostly in the anterior circulation, predominately the anterior communicating artery and posterior communicating artery, and frequently occurred contralateral to the site of occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therapeutic parent <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> is a likely risk factor for de novo <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Noninvasive follow-up studies should be performed, especially between 2 and 10 years after occlusion </plain></SENT>
