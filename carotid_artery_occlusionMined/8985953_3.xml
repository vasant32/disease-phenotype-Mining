<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The aim was to study a relationship between the flow pattern in the ophthalmic artery (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e>), the siphon and vessels within the circle of Willis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>27 patients, 22 males and 5 females, mean age 63 +/- 15 years (SD) with unilateral occlusion of the internal carotid artery (ICA) were examined by 3-dimensional Transcranial Doppler scanner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Flow signals from the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e>, the siphon and intracranial vessels were registered before and after i.v. injection of 1 g <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pathological flow pattern was found in 18 patients in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e> on the occluded side consisting of 12 retrograde and 6 isoelectric flow directions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> injection retrograde systolic velocities (SV) increased significantly (p &lt; 0.01), but anterograde velocities remained unchanged as did 3 isoelectric flow patterns, 2 turned to retrograde and one to anterograde flow direction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the siphon lower resting anterograde mean velocities (MV) were found on both sides (p &lt; 0.05) compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Six patients had the same retrograde flow as in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> MV in the siphon increased (p &lt; 0.01) only on the nonoccluded side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Baseline retrograde ophthalmic SV and MV in the siphon correlated (p &lt; 0.01 and p &lt; 0.05 respectively) with MV in the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) according to linear regression analysis (r = 0.78 and 0.59 respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients, having impaired vasomotor reactivity (VMR) &lt; or = 11% in the anterior cerebral artery (ACA) on the occluded side, had pathological flow pattern in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with greatest difference (delta) between MV in the ACA on the nonoccluded and occluded side had a tendency to anterograde flow (r = 0.56, p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Pulsative index (PI) in the ACA on the occluded side was lowest in the category with retrograde flow in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e> (0.67 +/- 0.14) and differed (p &lt; 0.05) from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normals</z:mpath> and from the category with isoelectric and anterograde flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Correlation of retrograde flow direction in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e> and baseline MV in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> and low PI in the ACA on the occluded side indicates a supplying ophthalmic collateral to the anterior brain circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Impaired VMR in the ACA on the occluded side in connection with pathological flow pattern in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e> may reflect an exhaustion of the ACA as a supplying vessel </plain></SENT>
