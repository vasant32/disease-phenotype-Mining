<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 62-year-old man with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and a history of ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary disease</z:hpo> visited the emergency department complaining of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> pain and swelling of the tongue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Physical examination found subtle swelling and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000980'>pallor</z:hpo> of the right side of the tongue, and he was initially diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000206'>glossitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, his symptoms were progressive, and the tongue had sustained serious tissue damage before the correct diagnosis was established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Digital subtraction angiography of the cervical vessels revealed occlusion of the right external carotid artery (ECA) and lingual artery without collateral circulation to the right side of the tongue from the contralateral ECA or ipsilateral vertebral artery (VA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Endovascular revascularization was performed to restore blood flow to the tongue using balloon angioplasty of the proximal segment of the right ECA followed by deployment of a self-expanding stent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Tongue pain subsided shortly after the procedure, and configuration of the tongue returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> 4 months after intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Tongue infarction is rare and usually associated with systemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042384" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vasculitides</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Tongue infarction due to unilateral occlusion of the ECA is extremely rare because of the rich collateral circulation to the tongue from the ipsilateral VA and contralateral ECA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Atherothrombotic unilateral occlusion of the ECA should be included in the differential diagnosis of tongue infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Revascularization of the occluded ECA is worth attempting despite substantial tissue damage because of the viability of the tongue muscles and the minimal risk of complications in experienced hands </plain></SENT>
