<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Temporary balloon occlusion (TBO) is the principal means to evaluate cerebrovascular reserve before carotid sacrifice (CS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite TBO, the incidence of ischemic events after CS remains a substantive problem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that differential alteration of systemic hemodynamic parameters during TBO could serve as measures of potential cerebral autoregulation-induced systemic compensatory responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These responses indicate compromised cerebrovascular reserve, thereby predicting ischemic events after CS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of patients who underwent TBO and CS from 1995 to the present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Demographics, neuroimaging including angiography, and hemodynamic parameters at baseline, during TBO, and after CS were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> after CS was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariable logistic regression models were used to predict the risk of ischemic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 139 patients who underwent TBO, 128 (92.1%) passed according to established criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of 65 patients who underwent CS, 11 patients had unchanged or decreased systolic blood pressure (SBP), whereas 54 patients had a spontaneous elevation of SBP during TBO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Only patients with a spontaneous elevation of SBP experienced ischemic events after CS (11 patients, 16.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> ischemic events occurred within 4 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Men and individuals older than age 50 were at higher risk of ischemic complications, despite demonstration of tolerance to TBO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: SBP changes during TBO are manifestations of systemic response to an adequate or a compromised cerebrovascular reserve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These systemic responses are crucial to predict outcome after CS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>We strongly recommend adjunctive tests in the instances of spontaneous elevation of SBP during TBO, particularly in men and the elderly </plain></SENT>
