<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> damage was demonstrable grossly by the presence of areas of blue discoloration, and microscopically by the presence of a bright red fluorescent tracer, localized mostly in the neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The survey of various groups of animals revealed a direct relationship between the incidence and time of appearance of the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> lesions and the duration of the ischemic occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This relationship can be interpreted as another example of the previously described "maturation" phenomenon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A relatively late occurrence of the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> injury in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, at the time when the affected brain tissue shows severe, edematous histopathologic changes indicates that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo>, as the main complication of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, could be regarded as being primarily of the cytotoxic type </plain></SENT>
