<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>From March 1980 to April 1990, 375 consecutive patients underwent 439 CEAs at the First Department of Vascular Surgery of Padova Medical School </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into two groups; group 1 (61 patients) had contralateral internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and group 2 (314 patients) did not (378 CEAs, 64 bilateral) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Indications for CEA were similar in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The only significant difference in patient characteristics was a higher rate of previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in group 1 (11% vs. 3%, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>General anesthesia, continuous EEG monitoring, selective intraluminal shunt, and arteriotomy closure with a <z:chebi fb="3" ids="53251">polytetrafluoroethylene</z:chebi> patch (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="53251">PTFE</z:chebi>) were used routinely in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An intraluminal shunt was inserted more frequently in group 1 than in group 2 (69% vs. 17%, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Major perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> occurred in one patient in each group (1.7% vs. 0.31%, respectively; NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Early fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rates were 0% and 0.95% in groups 1 and 2, respectively (NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had neurologic examinations and duplex scans every 6 months (range 6 to 118 months; mean 42 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier survival curves were virtually identical in the two groups; the majority of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were caused by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were no <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in group 1 as compared with 8.2% in group 2 (NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>New neurologic symptoms appeared in 4.7% of patients in group 1 and 6% in group 2 (NS) whereas the late <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rates were 0% and 3.1%, respectively (NS).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
