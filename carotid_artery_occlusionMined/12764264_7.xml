<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The efficacy of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) for prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> has been demonstrated in randomized trials; however, the optimal approach in patients excluded from these trials or who have other significant comorbid conditions remains controversial, particularly with the advent of percutaneous interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the influence of putative risk factors on outcome of CEA in a single-center experience </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 1370 consecutive CEA performed from 1990 to 1999 was undertaken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Preoperative risk factors examined included age older than 80 years, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0006510'>chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo> (serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> concentration &gt; 2.0 mg/dL), contralateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, recurrent ipsilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp>, ipsilateral hemispheric symptoms within 6 weeks, and recent coronary bypass grafting (CABG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Fisher exact test was used to identify baseline variables associated with perioperative (30 days) risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis with Poisson regression was used to study the effect of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> univariate criteria in combination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the overall cohort, there were 32 adverse events (2.3%), including 11 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (0.8%), 6 disabling <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> (0.4%), and 10 nondisabling <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> (0.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in incidence of perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> between patients with one or more risk factors (n = 689) and those with no risk factors (low risk, n = 681) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thirty-day mortality was significantly greater in patients with two or more risk factors compared with patients with no risk factors (2.8% vs 0.3%; P =.04), but no significant difference was noted in perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate (2.3% vs 1.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Univariate analysis demonstrated that contralateral carotid occlusion (n = 75) was the only significant predictor of adverse outcome (5 events, 6.7%) among the variables tested; this was confirmed with multivariate analysis (relative risk, 4.3; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-12.3; P =.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Five-year survival for patients with two or more risk factors was notably diminished compared with that for patients with no risk factors (38.7% +/- 5.9% vs 75.0% +/- 2.6%; P &lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Contralateral occlusion was also associated with reduced 5-year survival (38 +/- 11% vs 67 +/- 2%; P &lt;.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CEA can be safely performed in patients deemed at high risk, including those aged 80 years or older and others with significant comorbid conditions, with combined <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and mortality rates comparable to those found in randomized trials, ie, the Asymptomatic Carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>Atherosclerosis</z:hpo> Study and the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Contralateral occlusion may be a predictor for moderately increased perioperative risk and for reduced long-term survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Caution may be warranted in asymptomatic patients with multiple risk factors, in whom presumed long-term benefit of CEA may be compromised by markedly reduced 5-year survival </plain></SENT>
