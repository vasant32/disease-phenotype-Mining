<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While the human genome contains a single copy of the kininogen gene, 3 copies exist in the rat (1 encoding K-kininogen and 2 encoding T-kininogen) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we confirm that the mouse genome contains 2 homologous kininogen genes, mKng1 and mKng2, and demonstrate that these genes are expressed in a tissue-specific manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To determine the roles of these genes in murine development and <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp>, we disrupted mKng1, which is expressed primarily in the liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>mKng1(-/-) mice were viable, but lacked plasma HK and low-molecular-weight kininogen (LK), as well as DeltamHK-D5, a novel kininogen isoform that lacks kininogen domain 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, despite <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tail vein <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> times, mKng1(-/-) mice displayed a significantly prolonged time to carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> following <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52261">Rose Bengal</z:chebi> administration and laser-induced arterial injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that a single gene, mKng1, is responsible for production of plasma kininogen, and that plasma HK contributes to induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> in mice </plain></SENT>
