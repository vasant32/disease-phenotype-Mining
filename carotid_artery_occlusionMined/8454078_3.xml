<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the effects of carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> on cerebral blood flow (CBF), both hemispheric and regional CBF (rCBF) were investigated using intravenously (i.v.) administered 133Xenon with 3 min clearance recording time for two-dimensionally (hemispheric CBF) and 99m-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="33353">technetium</z:chebi>-hexamethylpropylene <z:chebi fb="39" ids="32952">amine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25750">oxime</z:chebi> (99mTC-HMPAO) for three-dimensionally single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography (SPECT) measurements (rCBF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients scheduled to undergo carotid endarterectomy anaesthetised with fentanyl/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> participated in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Preoperative evaluation included investigation of rCBF with SPECT in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two intraoperative 133Xe CBF measurements were performed in each patient, before and after occlusion of the carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The preoperative rCBF measurement constituted the reference, for technical reasons, for the intraoperative investigations of rCBF during cross-clamping, which was completed immediately after the hemispheric measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The increase in preoperative risk evaluation as described by Sundt et al. and modified by Cho et al. corresponded excellently to a decrease in hemispheric CBF due to cross-clamping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A significant decrease in rCBF (p &lt; 0.005) was present between patients with high and low preoperative risk score for the region of the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In this region, a correlation between decrease in rCBF and corresponding decrease in hemispheric CBF was also present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The present study demonstrates that the vascular regions of the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery are the most vulnerable vascular area during cross-clamping in individuals with high preoperative risk score.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
