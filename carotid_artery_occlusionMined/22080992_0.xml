<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The selection of patients with cervical internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (ICAO) for extracranial-intracranial bypass surgery is based on exhausted cerebrovascular reactivity to vasodilatory stimuli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, a spontaneous increase in this reactivity can occur with time, questioning the ideal time for bypass surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the natural course of dynamic cerebral autoregulation is not known in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with cervical ICAO were examined at baseline and after a mean interval of 15 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Dynamic autoregulation was determined by transcranial Doppler sonography in both middle cerebral arteries via respiratory-induced 0.1-Hz oscillations (phase, available for n=47 patients) and correlation analysis between diastolic blood pressure and Doppler signal (index Dx, n=55 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pre-defined cut-off values and repeatability measures of healthy controls were used to define significant individual changes in autoregulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Group mean comparisons between studies were not significant for any autoregulation parameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The intraclass correlation coefficient between studies was high for phase (ipsilateral: 0.83; contralateral: 0.74), and moderate for Dx (ipsilateral: 0.63; contralateral: 0.35) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no clear trend for an improvement across cut-off values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A significant individual improvement/deterioration in autoregulation occurred in 6%/6% for phase and 13%/9% for Dx </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Dynamic autoregulation only rarely improves during the course of ICAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This finding should be considered when deciding for or against a policy of delaying extracranial-intracranial bypass surgery for reasons of a potentially improving hemodynamic status </plain></SENT>
