<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Seventeen patients and 17 control subjects were studied, using T2*-weighted gradient echo acquisition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Gray and white matter regions were obtained by segmentation of inversion recovery MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Lesions were excluded by segmentation of T2-weighted MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the symptomatic hemisphere, cerebral blood volume was increased in white matter (P &lt; .05) but not in gray matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No cerebral blood flow changes were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> timing parameters (mean transit time [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi>], time of appearance, and time to peak) showed a significant delay for both white and gray matter (P &lt; .05), but the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> increase of white matter was significantly larger than for gray matter (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that differentiation between gray and white matter is essential to determine the hemodynamic effects of an ICA occlusion </plain></SENT>
