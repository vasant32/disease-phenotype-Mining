<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Researchers failed to reproduce preclinical efficacy in subsequent clinical development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To bridge this translation failure, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Therapy Academic Industry Round Table (STAIR) has suggested a rigorous, robust, and detailed preclinical evaluation in at least 2 species and multiple <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> models to avoid the clinical failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Considering these recommendations, in the present study, we have investigated the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> in global model cerebral ischemic-reperfusion (IR) injury in gerbils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Global cerebral IR injury, produced by bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> for 5 min, was characterized by neurological deficits, <z:mp ids='MP_0001399'>hyperlocomotion</z:mp>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegeneration</z:hpo> in the hippocampal CA1 region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was also associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and DNA fragmentation as evident from increased malondialdehyde (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>) levels and TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi> nick end labeling)-positive cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Global cerebral IR injury associated neurological damage was significantly attenuated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> pretreatment as evident from reduction in neurological symptoms, <z:mp ids='MP_0001399'>hyperlocomotion</z:mp>, and CA1 hippocampal neuronal damage in IR-challenged gerbils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">Pioglitazone</z:chebi> pretreatment also attenuated the <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and DNA fragmentation after cerebral IR injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">Pioglitazone</z:chebi> post-treatment has also significantly reduced the CA1 hippocampal neuronal damage and DNA fragmentation after cerebral IR injury in IR-challenged gerbils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates the neuroprotective activity of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8228">pioglitazone</z:chebi> in global cerebral IR injury and its neuroprotective effects may be attributed to reduction in <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and DNA fragmentation </plain></SENT>
