<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine the predictors of clinical and angiographic outcomes in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The trial cohorts were combined in a data set of 305 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-eight baseline variables were included in univariate and multivariate analyses to define the independent predictors of good outcomes (modified Rankin Scale score &lt;/=2), mortality, and successful revascularization (Thrombolysis In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">Myocardial Ischemia</z:e> 2 to 3 flow) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the univariate analysis, final revascularization, baseline National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale, age, and systolic blood pressure were associated with both good outcomes and mortality at 90 days (P&lt;0.0018 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the multivariate analysis, final revascularization (OR, 20.4; 95% CI, 7.7 to 53.9; P&lt;0.0001), baseline National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (OR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.81 to 0.92; P&lt;0.0001), and age (OR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.95 to 0.98; P=0.0004) were independent predictors of good outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Final revascularization (OR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.16 to 0.50; P&lt;0.0001), baseline National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale score (odds ratio, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.04 to 1.14; P=0.0001), age (OR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.03 to 1.07; P&lt;0.0001), and internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (OR, 2.17; 95% CI, 1.22 to 3.86; P=0.0084) were the strongest predictors of mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Systolic blood pressure (&lt;150 versus &gt;or=150 mm Hg; OR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.26 to 0.70; P=0.0007) and M2 occlusion (OR, 3.86; 95% CI, 1.28 to 11.67; P=0.0168) were independent predictors of revascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Final recanalization status represents the strongest predictor of clinical outcomes in patients undergoing thrombectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The ability to remove the clot is negatively influenced by systolic blood pressure on presentation perhaps because of the hydraulic forces imposed by higher blood pressures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusions</z:mp> are associated with increased mortality, they do not appear to influence the chances of good outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This finding supports the inclusion of internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusions</z:mp> in future efficacy trials </plain></SENT>
