<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In these patients, dilation of the stenotic ECA is required to improve the blood flow in the STA before STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A 71-year-old man presented with left <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001260'>dysarthria</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging revealed an old watershed infarction in the right cerebral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Right carotid angiography showed right ICA occlusion and severe ipsilateral ECA stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography (SPECT) demonstrated severe hemodynamic insufficiency in the right <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Instead of endarterectomy of the ECA, angioplasty and stenting (CAS) for ECA was performed to ensure adequate blood flow in the STA, due to the history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> and bifurcation of the common carotid artery at a high level (C2 level) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Then STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis was performed 1 month later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Postoperative SPECT demonstrated marked improvement of hemodynamic insufficiency in the right <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After treatment, the patient had no ischemic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This case suggests external CAS together with STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis is a good therapeutic option for a patient with symptomatic ICA occlusion and severe stenosis of the ipsilateral ECA if external CEA is difficult to perform </plain></SENT>
