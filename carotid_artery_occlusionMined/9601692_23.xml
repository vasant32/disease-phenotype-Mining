<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>When administered at 50 mg/kg, i.p., 30 min and 6 h after a 3 min period of bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (BCAO), the compound reduced the damage to CA1 hippocampal neurones to a significant level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, when the ischaemic insult was made more severe, by increasing the period of occlusion to 4 and 5 min, the neuroprotective effects of LY354740 were reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From these findings, it would appear that Group II mGluRs may play a role in ischaemic damage in the gerbil hippocampus and that <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> at these receptors are potential neuroprotective agents </plain></SENT>
