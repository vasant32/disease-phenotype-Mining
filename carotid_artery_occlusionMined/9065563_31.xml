<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether moderate, transient whole-body <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>hyperthermia</z:hpo> (approximately 39.6 degrees C), if imposed 1 day following a brief episode of forebrain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, would affect the neuropathologic outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Forty-two Wistar rats were subjected to either a 5- or 7-minute period of bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> plus <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> (50 mm Hg), or to the equivalent sham procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four hours later, rats of one subgroup were placed into a hyperthermic chamber containing high-intensity lamps designed to elevate rectal temperature to 39 to 40 degrees C for 3 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Normothermic subgroups received the same procedures, but the heating lamps were turned off </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eight days after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> or the sham procedure, brains were perfusion-fixed, and numbers of ischemic-appearing CA1 pyramidal neurons were counted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In rats with 7-minute forebrain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, delayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>hyperthermia</z:hpo> increased mean numbers of ischemic neurons by 2.6- to 2.7-fold in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subsectors of area CA1 (p &lt; 0.05, ANOVA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Delayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>hyperthermia</z:hpo> in 5-minute ischemic rats also tended to increase mean numbers of ischemic neurons (by 11-fold in lateral, 6-fold in middle, and 5-fold in medial CA1 subsectors), but these differences were not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that moderate, transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>hyperthermia</z:hpo>, even if occurring 1 day after a 7-minute global ischemic insult, exacerbates the extent of ischemic neuronal injury </plain></SENT>
