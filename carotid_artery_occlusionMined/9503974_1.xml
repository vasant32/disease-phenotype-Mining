<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Brain CT and MRI revealed bilateral caudate head hemorrhagic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> including bilateral anterior internal capsules, in which the left lesion was more extensive than right one and involved the part of the left putamen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> locations were thought to be supplied by the area around the medial striate artery including Heubner's arteries and the A1 perforator </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Bilateral caudate head <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> involving the anterior internal capsule may cause prominent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0919974" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">abulia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
