<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The morphological patterns of the ischaemic lesions were classified into three categories: lacunar, thromboembolic and haemodynamic infarctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of 29 patients with an exhausted <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> reactivity, 19 showed a haemodynamic type of infarction, whereas of 45 cases with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> reactivity only 2, and of 38 patients with a diminished <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> reactivity only 3 had haemodynamically caused infarctions (P less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The correlation between an exhausted <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> reactivity and the presence of haemodynamic infarctions could be of value for therapy in patients with carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusions</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
