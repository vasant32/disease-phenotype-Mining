<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rat pial microcirculation was visualized by fluorescence microscopy through a closed cranial window </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pial arterioles were classified in five orders of branchings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Capillaries were assigned order 0, the smallest arterioles order 1, and the largest ones order 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In ischemic rats, 30 min BCCAO and 60 min reperfusion caused arteriolar diameter decrease (by 14.5 ± 3.3% of baseline in order 2), microvascular leakage [0.47 ± 0.04, normalized gray levels (NGL)], leukocyte <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> in venules (9 ± 2/100 μm venular length, v.l./30 s), and reduction of capillary perfusion (by 40 ± 7% of baseline) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, at the end of BCCAO and reperfusion there was a significant increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation when compared with baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="16243">Quercetin</z:chebi> highest dose determined dilation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> arteriolar orders (by 40 ± 4% of baseline in order 2) and prevented microvascular permeability (0.15 ± 0.02 NGL), leukocyte <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> (3 ± 1/100 μm v.l./30 s) as well as ROS formation, while capillary perfusion was protected </plain></SENT>
