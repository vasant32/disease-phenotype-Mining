<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We describe a technique to predict preoperatively the safety of permanently occluding an internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The method was performed by imaging stable <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi> cerebral blood flow (CBF) with the internal carotid artery both open and temporarily occluded with a nondetachable balloon on a double lumen Swan-Ganz catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were those in whom we planned to sacrifice the internal carotid artery (those with giant or inaccessible <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>) or those in whom such a sacrifice was at least likely (those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376527" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">skull base tumors</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into three groups on the basis of a comparison of occluded and nonoccluded CBF values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Group-I patients had no significant change in CBF with internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>; group-II patients showed a symmetric decrease in CBF; and group-III patients had an asymmetric decrease in CBF, always greater on the occluded side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A fourth group clinically failed to tolerate even brief carotid occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The internal carotid artery in one patients from group III was sacrificed at surgery: the size and shape of his postoperative <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> corresponded almost exactly to the area of asymmetrically decreased CBF on his occluded study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The data suggest that if surgery is likely to result in permanent occlusion of the internal carotid artery, then patients who are at risk for delayed neurologic injury due to a compromised cerebral blood flow should have arterial bypass grafts before such surgery is performed </plain></SENT>
