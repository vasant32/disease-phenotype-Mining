<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At 0 min of recovery the tryptophan hydroxylation rate was 40% of control, whereas tyrosine hydroxylation was unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Removal of the clamp and reoxygenation for 60 min resulted in a normalization of oxidative metabolism and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33856">aromatic amino acid</z:chebi> hydroxylase function and thus indicated no permanent detectable defect of these processes in the restituted hypoxemic-oligemic brain </plain></SENT>
