<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Regional rates of incorporation of plasma <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi> into the hippocampus and other regions of the anterior circulation were determined relative to the mean rate of incorporation into regions of the posterior circulation using quantitative autoradiography and a ratio method of analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One day after bilateral carotid occlusion, relative <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi> incorporation was elevated significantly by 16% in the CA4 pyramidal cell layer and by 20% in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus compared with sham-operated gerbils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At 3 days, significant elevations of this magnitude were found in the CA3 and CA4 cell layers, whereas relative incorporation was reduced by 26% in the CA1 pyramidal cell layer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At 7 days, the only significant difference from control was a 15% elevated incorporation in the CA3 pyramidal cell layer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Histologic examination indicated substantial cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in the CA1 pyramidal layer at 3 days, with extensive glial reaction and phagocytic invasion at 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that the turnover of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29889">palmitate</z:chebi>-containing <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> is reduced in the CA1 layer of the gerbil hippocampus but that <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> synthesis is stimulated in hippocampal regions (CA3, CA4, dentate gyrus) affected by but recovering from transient bilateral carotid occlusion </plain></SENT>
