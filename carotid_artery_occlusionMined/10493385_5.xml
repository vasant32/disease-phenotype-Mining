<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE AND IMPORTANCE: The vasa vasorum are involved in the pathophysiological development of carotid artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, providing vascular support to the thickened intima and plaque </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>When advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> causes carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, the vasa vasorum may serve as a means of revascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL PRESENTATION: We studied four patients with internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> who exhibited revascularization, distal to the occlusion, by small vascular channels that were inconsistent with recanalization through the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The channels had an angiographic appearance consistent with their being hypertrophied vasa vasorum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Significant collateral circulation was provided by the revascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> four patients exhibited adequate collateral circulation and were treated with antiplatelet or anticoagulation medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The vasa vasorum have not been previously reported to contribute to the revascularization of occluded arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The four cases presented in this report suggest that the vasa vasorum can be a source of collateral circulation after carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> secondary to atherosclerotic disease </plain></SENT>
