<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There was a significantly lower resting Vmca in Group II patients on the occluded side, but not on the stenosed side in Group III, but there was considerable overlap of results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, during breath holding, the rate of increase of Vmca allowed better separation of the occluded side (Group II) from the contralateral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> side as well as from controls, and from the stenosed side in Group III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Also there was a lower rate of rise of Vmca on the stenosed side in Group III than controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As a test in symptomatic patients with a relevant carotid occlusion, values of less than 2.4 mm/sec2 were found in 100% of patients and only 4.5% of controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Reactivity to breath holding promises to be a useful test in the evaluation of symptomatic patients with extra cranial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
