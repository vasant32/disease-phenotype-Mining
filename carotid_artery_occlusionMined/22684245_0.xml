<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, little is known regarding the potential retinoprotective effects of preconditioning by <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anaesthetic</z:chebi> drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0006190'>Retinal ischemia</z:mp> can be modeled by permanent bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (BCCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we studied the degree of ischemic injury with preconditioning by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9130">sevoflurane</z:chebi> in the rat retina </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During the BCCAO operation and preconditioning Wistar rats were anaesthetized with 1 MAC of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9130">sevoflurane</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The oxygen, carbon dioxide, and <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anaesthetic</z:chebi> vapor concentration in the anaesthetizing box was monitored with a gas analyzer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We examined 4 groups: non- and preconditioning groups in control and BCCAO animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The duration of preconditioning period was 1 h and it was performed 1 day before BCCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The retinas were processed for histological evaluation after 2 weeks survival to determine the cell number in the ganglion cell layer and the thickness of the whole retina and that of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> layers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>BCCAO-induced <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> ischemic injury was ameliorated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9130">sevoflurane</z:chebi> preconditioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">Retinal</z:chebi> thickness and the cell number in the ganglion cell layer were more retained in preconditioned animals after BCCAO compared to non-preconditioned group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that preconditioning using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9130">sevoflurane</z:chebi> could provide a new perspective in retinoprotective strategies </plain></SENT>
