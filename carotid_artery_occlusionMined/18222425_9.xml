<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Some lines of evidence have suggested that subcortical ischemic vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (SIVD) is a common form of vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VaD), and that its pathological changes are the development of ischemic white matter (WM) lesions under <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> hypoperfusion and lacunes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we have developed a novel mouse model of VaD with WM lesions, which was induced by right unilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (rUCCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mice subjected to rUCCAO exhibited <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1695782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral hypoperfusion</z:e> in the cerebral hemisphere ipsilateral to rUCCAO monitored using a laser-Doppler flow meter (p&lt;0.01), and significant WM damage in the corpus callosum (p&lt;0.05) and deficits in object recognition test correlated with the damage of frontal-subcortical circuits (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, no differences in spontaneous alternation or spontaneous motor activity were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), significantly increased (p&lt;0.01), and those of anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-10 (IL-10), significantly decreased in the ischemic brain (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that this model is a useful tool for investigating the associations among inflammatory reactions, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo>, and WM damage, which may help elucidating the pathomechanism of VaD, particularly SIVD </plain></SENT>
