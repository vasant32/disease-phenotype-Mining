<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Patients with critical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007282" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery stenoses</z:e> have been considered to be at high risk for carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> necessitating urgent or emergency endarterectomy once the stenosis is identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Included in this group of patients are those with carotid string sign or atheromatous pseudoocclusion (<z:chebi fb="16" ids="53704">APO</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This review was conducted to determine the impact of the severity of stenosis including <z:chebi fb="16" ids="53704">APO</z:chebi> on the treatment and outcome of patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The records of 203 consecutive carotid endarterectomies performed in 197 patients were reviewed in detail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were stratified into a critical stenosis group (80% to 99% diameter) and noncritical stenosis group based on noninvasive vascular laboratory and carotid arteriography results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Comparisons were performed of demographic data, atherosclerotic risk factors, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery disease</z:e> presentation, interval between arteriography and endarterectomy, operative details, and surgical results between the critical and noncritical groups and between patients in the critical group with and without <z:chebi fb="16" ids="53704">APO</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Carotid endarterectomies were performed on 91 critical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007282" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery stenoses</z:e> and 112 noncritical stenoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The groups did not differ significantly with regards to demographics, risk factors, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery disease</z:e> presentation, mean back pressure, and operative use of shunt or patch closure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For the critical group the interval between arteriography and endarterectomy was 8.63 +/- 2.38 days compared with 9.64 +/- 2.14 days for the noncritical group (mean +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>, p = 0.75) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No patient in either group progressed to occlusion in the interval between arteriography and endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> occurred in two patients (2%) in the critical group and four patients (3.6%) in the noncritical group (p = 0.09) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Likewise, no significant difference was demonstrated in these variables when comparing patients with critical carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> and <z:chebi fb="16" ids="53704">APO</z:chebi> with those without <z:chebi fb="16" ids="53704">APO</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The presence of a critical carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> including <z:chebi fb="16" ids="53704">APO</z:chebi> did not impact on the treatment or outcome of patients requiring endarterectomy nor did it imply the need for emergency intervention to prevent <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Surgical intervention can proceed after evaluation and optimization of comorbid conditions without undue concern for interval <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
