<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The methodology is based upon the surgical isolation and instrumentation of both common carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A loop of dental floss is placed around each carotid artery and passed through double lumen catheter material; this allows for later occlusion of the carotid arteries and their release in unanesthetized subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Functional changes following transient carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> are readily demonstrated by the occurrence of altered spontaneous locomotor activity at various times postischemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This model should be useful in the evaluation of potential therapeutic agents in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
