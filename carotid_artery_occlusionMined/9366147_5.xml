<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and regional <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> utilization (rCGU) were analyzed by autoradiographical methods, pathological observation of the brains was also conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male Wistar rats aged 12 weeks were anesthetized and the bilateral carotid arteries were occluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Physiological parameters, ABG, MABP, and rectal temperature were measured before and through occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 2 days, 1, 4, and 8 weeks and controls of rCBF (Sakurada) and rCGU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>(Sokoloff) were measured (n = 6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Evaluated regions included frontal cortex (Fcor), parietal cortex (Pcor), temporal cortex (Tcor), occipital cortex (Ocor), genu corpus callosum (gCC), corpus callosum (CC), splenium corpus callosum (sCC), caudate putamen (CPu), globus pallidus (GP), internal capsule (IC), thalamus (Thal), hippocampus CA 1 (CA 1), hypothalamus (HypoTh), amygdal (Amygd), and substantia nigra (SNR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In separate animals (n = 3) tissue sections were stained using Kl√ºver-Barrera (KB) and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">Hematoxylin</z:chebi>-Eosin (HE), and pathological changes were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After 2 days the rCBF values were significantly reduced to 33-58% of control values in the Fcor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Pcor, Tcor, Ocor, gCC, CC, sCC, CPu, GP, JC, and Amygd </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The reductions were observed from the 2nd day to the 1st week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>From the 1st week to the 4th week values began to recover to control levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, after 4 weeks they were still significantly reduced in the Ocor, gCC, CC, sCC, GP, IC, and SNR (51-63%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>After 8 weeks, the rCBF values in the areas except white matter, CPu, GP, and Ocor, etc., recovered to approximately 90% of control levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>However, in the Ocor, gCC, CC, sCC, CPu, GP, and IC, they were still 70-89% of control levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>After 2 days the rCGU values were reduced to 56-95% (except Amygd) in the measured regions, although not as reduced as the rCBF levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>From the 2nd day to the 1st week, the rCGU values were reduced further and after 1 week the rCGU values were significantly reduced to 39-69% in the Fcor, Pcor, Tcor, Ocor, gCC, CC, sCC, CPu, GP, IC (Lt), Thal (Rt), Amygd, and SNR From the 1st week to the 4th week, the values began to recover to control levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>After 4 weeks, rCGU improved to approximately 90-100% of controls, and remained at that level through 8 weeks occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Rarefaction of the myelinated fibers was observed in the white matter from the 1st week to the 4th week in the KB stained sections, while little change in cortex was observed throughout 1st to 8th week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In this <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> hypoperfusion model rCBF remained depressed after 8 weeks in the Ocor, white matter, and basal ganglia, and rarefaction of the white matter was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that this model is suitable for the study of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1695782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral hypoperfusion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
