<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Regional cerebral protein synthesis was investigated in the Mongolian gerbil during recovery from forebrain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> produced by bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> for 5 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At various recirculation periods up to 72 h animals received a single dose of L-(3,5-3H)tyrosine and were killed 30 min later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Brains were processed for autoradiography using the stripping film technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During the initial 30 min of recirculation autoradiographs revealed an almost complete inhibition of protein synthesis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> forebrain structures with the exception of the medio-dorsal thalamic nuclei </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Between 30 min and 12 h of recirculation amino acid incorporation was completely restored in neurons of the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, hippocampal CA3 and CA4 zones and the dentate gyrus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In CA1, early (90-min postischemia) and progressive recovery of a few irregularly dispersed neurons was observed, but the vast majority of pyramidal cells never regained their <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> biosynthetic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Between 3 and 6 h of recirculation CA1 neurons showed faint labeling, followed by a secondary deterioration resulting in complete lack of incorporation within 12 h after restoration of blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Autoradiographs at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subsequent time points exhibited persistent inhibition of protein synthesis in CA1 until neuronal <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> occurred 2-3 days later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, in contrast to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-resistant cell populations with rapid progressive and complete restoration of protein synthesis, hippocampal neurons undergoing delayed <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> are characterized by an early incomplete recovery immediately followed by a secondary persistent inhibition </plain></SENT>
