<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We examined 84 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> treated with intravenous rt-PA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ischemic changes and vascular lesions were identified using DWI, and magnetic resonance angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Early ischemic signs were assessed using ASPECTS-DWI (11 points) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Independent outcome was defined by NIHSS at 24 hours after intravenous rt-PA therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 58 patients were studied, and NIHSS 27 (46.6%) of them had improved by 4 points in 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Cases of 0≦AD≦3, cardioembolic type cases with internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in the group of 4≦AD≦7 and branch atheromatous disease in the group of 8≦AD were poor outcome at NIHSS 24 hours after intravenous rt-PA therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
