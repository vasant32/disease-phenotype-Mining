<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the effect of neuropeptide NAP (NAPVSIPQ) on early cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, long-term neurological function and brain injury after neonatal HI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seven-day-old rat pups were subjected to an HI model by applying a unilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The animals were randomly assigned to groups receiving an intraperitoneal injection of NAP (3 Î¼g/g) or vehicle immediately (0 h) and 24 h after HI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Brain DNA damage, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation and reduced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> (GSH) content were determined 24 h after the last NAP injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>Cognitive impairment</z:hpo> was assessed on postnatal day 60 using the spatial version of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water maze</z:mp> learning task </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Next, the animals were euthanized to assess the cerebral hemispheric volume using the Cavalieri principle associated with the counting point method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We observed that NAP prevented the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> HI-induced DNA and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> membrane damage and also recovered the GSH levels in the injured hemisphere of the HI rat pups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further, NAP was able to prevent impairments in learning and long-term spatial memory and to significantly reduce brain damage up to 7 weeks following the neonatal HI injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our findings demonstrate that NAP confers potent neuroprotection from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> brain <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, long-term <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> induced by neonatal HI through, at least in part, the modulation of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi>-mediated <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> system </plain></SENT>
