<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nine had complete internal carotid occlusion on arteriography and 10 had severe stenosis which had progressed to total occlusion by the time of surgical exploration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At operation irreparable fibrotic changes were observed in four patients, but in 15 a pattern of proximal focal obstruction with relatively healthy distal internal carotid vessels was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thromboendarterectomy produced good back-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> in most of these and resulted in improved carotid flow after operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seventeen of 19 patients were relieved of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two patients continued to have symptoms, but less frequently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> after operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Follow-up from 3 to 36 months showed no change from immediate postoperative results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that carotid artery exploration and thromboendarterectomy should be considered when transient ischemic episodes are present despite complete internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
