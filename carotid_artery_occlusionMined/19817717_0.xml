<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: After <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> by right common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in combination with hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> (35 mmHg) for 30 min, 1.0 minimum alveolar concentration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9130">sevoflurane</z:chebi> was administered for 15 min (Post-C 15, n=8), 30 min (Post-C 30, n=8), or 60 min (Post-C 60, n=8) in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="9130">Sevoflurane</z:chebi> was not administered in control (n=8) and sham control rats (n=8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neurologic evaluations were performed at 24, 48, and 72 h after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Degrees of neuronal damage in ischemic hippocampal CA1 and the cortex were assessed by counting eosinophilic neurons, and detection of DNA fragmentation was performed by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi> nick end-labeling (TUNEL) staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Neurologic deficit scores in the Post-C 60 group were higher than in the control group at 48 and 72 h post-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No differences were observed in the percentages of eosinophilic neurons among the control (CA1: 37.3 +/- 25.4, cortex: 26.0 +/- 8.9), Post-C 15 (CA1: 54.0 +/- 21.4, cortex: 30.8 +/- 19.9), or Post-C 30 (CA1: 68.4 +/- 17.5, cortex: 38.0 +/- 11.0) groups in ischemic CA1 and cortices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, in the Post-C 60 group, the percentages of eosinophilic neurons were higher than in the control group in CA1 and cortices (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The percentages of TUNEL-positive cell were similar in the control group and the post-conditioned groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These findings show that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9130">sevoflurane</z:chebi> administration after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> does not provide neuroprotection in rats subjected to incomplete <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
