<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the prognosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751815" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">internal carotid artery dissection</z:e> is worse than classically reported by comparing the characteristics of patients who had an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> admitted to a population-based primary care center with internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> due to either dissection (DO) or atherothrombosis (AO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Among 3502 patients admitted to our population-based primary care center, DO (n = 73) was diagnosed by angiography or magnetic resonance imaging, while AO (n = 81) was diagnosed by angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The characteristics of patients with DO or AO were compared using univariate and multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with DO were younger (mean [SD] age, 44.6 [10] vs. 60.1 [10] years, P&lt;.001), had fewer vascular risk factors, and presented more frequently with global middle cerebral artery territory involvement (42% vs. 17%, P&lt;.05) and less frequently with watershed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (3% vs. 19%, P&lt;.05) than patients with AO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Unexpectedly, patients with DO were noted to have more severe clinical impairment, with an increased frequency of decreased consciousness, and a poorer outcome at 1 month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed that the independent factors associated with DO were age younger than 55 years, nonsmoker, no history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> at presentation, and global <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with DO are younger and are initially seen with fewer risk factors than patients with AO, but their clinical features and prognosis are worse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Large <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> involving the whole middle cerebral artery territory that may be due to the lack of collateral circulation are responsible for the bad prognosis of patients with DO </plain></SENT>
