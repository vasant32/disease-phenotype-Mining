<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>For the first time we set up a new model for global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in the infant mice, and time-dependent changes of the blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) disruption and neuronal cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were investigated in detail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Infant C57/B16 mice (postnatal 13 days) were anesthetized with inhalation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9130">sevoflurane</z:chebi> in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17045,29796">N2O</z:chebi>/O2 (70/30%) and were subjected to global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> by bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (CCAO) for 25 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Disruption of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> was noted at 4 hours and increased up to 24 hours after the injection of 2% Evan's Blue in the transient CCAO (tCCAO) model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Evaluation of neuronal cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was determined with toluidine blue staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Morphological changes of neurons after tCCAO were clearly observed in the hippocampal CA1 region but were slightly detected in the CA3 region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, there were no morphological changes in the hippocampal dentate gyrus, the neocortex, the striatum and the hypothalamus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The number of survival neurons in the CA1 was significantly decreased at 2 days and sustained up to 4 days after tCCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that this method is very useful to induce selective vulnerability in mouse hippocampus, and it provides a reliable ischemic model in infant mice </plain></SENT>
