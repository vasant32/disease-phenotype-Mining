<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We investigated the hypothesis that bradykinin generation may induce ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> in spontaneously hypertensive rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>Cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> lasting 3 hours was produced by bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in 67 rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After the ischemic period, the rats were reperfused </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cerebral water content and energy metabolites (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="15422">adenosine triphosphate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi>), as well as plasma and tissue bradykinin, were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Additionally, using the same experimental paradigm, bradykinin synthesis inhibitors (aprotinin [n = 7] and soybean trypsin inhibitor [n = 7]) were administered immediately after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> induction to determine the relation of bradykinin generation to the progression of ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Cerebral water content increased during the 3-hour ischemic period, peaked at 30 minutes of reperfusion, and declined thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Bradykinin levels in plasma and tissue rose markedly 30 minutes after reperfusion and fell thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The progressive loss of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15422">adenosine triphosphate</z:chebi> was mirrored by the rise in <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the treated groups, aprotinin and soybean trypsin inhibitor administration significantly attenuated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> (p &lt; 0.01 and p &lt; 0.05, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The treated groups also showed less <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> accumulation and more <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15422">adenosine triphosphate</z:chebi> preservation than did the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that bradykinin levels in plasma and tissue corresponded to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> progression and that bradykinin suppression decreased <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These novel findings indicate that bradykinin activation augments the progression of ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
