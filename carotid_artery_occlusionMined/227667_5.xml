<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effects of partial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> induced by either <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> or intermittent carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> on these parameters were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nonischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> were characterized by gradual generalized decreases in cortical <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16908">NADH</z:chebi> fluorescence and increases in O2 consumption, along with rapid increases in [K+]0, which then usually fell slightly as the ictal discharge continued </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, on the other hand, were accompanied by complex changes in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16908">NADH</z:chebi> fluorescence, by smaller delayed maximal increases in O2 consumption that lasted beyond the end of ictal activity, and by more sustained increases in [K+]0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The decay of [K+]0 after the termination of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> in both nonischemic and moderately ischemic animals was not a monoexponential function: plots of ln delta [K+]0 versus time showed an initial linear decline (of slope M1) that rather abruptly slowed (to slope M2) after 2 to 5 sec and then often increased to the original rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both M1 and M2 were proportionately decreased by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, the rate of [K+]0 removal could be slowed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> induced either during or after the end of ictal activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The initial rate of postictal [K+]0 removal (M1) was found to be linearly and inversely related to the level of cortical <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16908">NADH</z:chebi> fluorescence at the time of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> termination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results of this study suggest that an O2-dependent transport mechanism plays a major role in the removal of [K+]0 during and following the termination of generalized pentylenetetrazol <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> in the cat </plain></SENT>
