<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There were 10 males and 10 females, with an average age of 55 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The left middle cerebral artery was involved in 17 patients and the right in three </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Flow was restored in 16 patients (75%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> originated in the heart in seven, the carotid artery in seven, the aorta in three, an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> in one, and an indeterminate source in two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It was technically most difficult to achieve patency with atheromatous emboli from the aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two patients (10%) had an excellent result with no neurological deficit, five (25%) were left with a minimal deficit but were employable, seven (35%) had a fair result but were still independent and employable, four (20%) did poorly, and two (10%) died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with an associated ipsilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> did poorly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Collateral flow, as judged from preoperative angiograms, was the best predictor of outcome </plain></SENT>
