<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Previous studies concerning internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion have focused on long-term prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present study was to evaluate short-term outcomes of patients with symptomatic ICA occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used data from the Registry of the Canadian <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Network on consecutive patients presenting to 11 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> centers in Ontario </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We included patients with noncardioembolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> within the anterior circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The resulting cohort was divided into 4 groups based on vascular imaging of the ipsilateral extracranial ICA: occlusion, severe stenosis, moderate stenosis, and mild/no stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Logistic regression modeling was used to evaluate the association between the degree of stenosis/occlusion of the symptomatic ICA and a series of short-term outcome measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 4144 patients who met study criteria, 283 patients had a symptomatic ICA occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with patients with ICA occlusion, patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other degrees of stenosis had a lower risk of in-hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, neurological worsening, and poor functional outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Particularly, severe stenosis was associated with a lower risk of in-hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (adjusted OR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.20 to 0.79), neurological worsening (adjusted OR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.34 to 0.78), and poor functional outcome (adjusted OR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.41 to 0.94) compared with the ICA occlusion group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results of our study showed that patients with symptomatic ICA occlusion are at a high risk of adverse outcomes that is as severe, if not worse, than any other degree of ICA stenosis in the short term </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, more aggressive management may be warranted for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>, symptomatic ICA occlusion </plain></SENT>
