<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Lubeluzole is not an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">N-methyl-D-aspartate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> but prevents postischemic increase in extracellular <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study examined whether lubeluzole, administered after global incomplete <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in rats, is capable of preserving the structural integrity of CA1 hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Ischemia</z:e> was induced by bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> for a duration of 9 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Delayed neuronal cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was histologically evaluated 7 days later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This was done by scoring acidophilic cell change and coagulative <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> and by counting the number of surviving neurons in the CA1 subfield </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Experiments were performed according to a paired design (13 animals per treatment group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Posttreatment with lubeluzole (0.31 mg/kg i.v. bolus at 5 minutes and 0.31 mg/kg i.v. infusion during 1 hour) resulted in significant neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Whereas in the untreated rats there were 42 (median) viable neurons per millimeter CA1 layer in the left and 69 in the right hemisphere, in the drug-treated rats 99 viable neurons per millimeter were found in the left (P = .002) and 113 in the right hemisphere (P = .013) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Histological scores, reflecting altered staining properties of the hippocampal cells, correlated strongly with the quantitative data, reflecting the structural integrity of CA1 pyramidal neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Lubeluzole, when administered after an ischemic insult in rats, protects vulnerable brain regions against delayed structural injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The results support the potential clinical use of this new drug in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> treatment </plain></SENT>
