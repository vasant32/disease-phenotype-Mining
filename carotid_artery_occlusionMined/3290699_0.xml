<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The efficiency of the anastomosis was evaluated by the modified Pourcelot indices (relative end-diastolic flow velocities) of the preauricular superficial temporal artery and of the bypass-supplying branch at the edge of the burr-hole </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The influence of intermittent compression of the bypass-supplying branch on the modified Pourcelot index of the ipsilateral common carotid was used as a further criterion in the sonographic evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> efficient anastomoses, defined by a modified Pourcelot index of at least 0.20 at the edge of the burr-hole, exhibited a reduction of the relative end-diastolic flow velocity of 0.08 on the average in the common carotid during compression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the 18 cases with unilateral occlusion of the internal carotid, bypass surgery was predominantly efficacious in those patients who showed a reduction in the sum of the modified Pourcelot indices of the remaining brain-supplying arteries of at least two standard deviations with respect to the mean of age-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The subgroups of patent and absent collaterals through the ophthalmic artery did not show any difference with respect to the percentage of efficient anastomoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 4 patients with bilateral internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, bypass surgery was effective, while 50% of the patients with intracranial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery disease</z:e> exhibited an insufficient anastomosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
