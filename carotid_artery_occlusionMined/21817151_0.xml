<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: NB-3 is a member of the F3/contactin family of neural recognition molecules, which are crucial for cell morphogenesis and motility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>NB-3 is expressed in neurons and plays an important role in axonal extension and neuronal survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the role of NB-3 in cerebral ischemic injury remains unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Adult male <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> and NB-3 knockout mice were subjected to ischemic injury by unilateral middle cerebral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> for 3 hours, 6 hours, and 12 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ischemic infarction volumes were then determined by 2, 3, 5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neurological dysfunction analysis was also performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Primary culture of neuronal cells from <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> and knockout animals was also used for analysis of neuronal survival and neurite outgrowth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: NB-3 expression in the ischemic hemisphere was decreased after transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>NB-3-knockout mice developed a 2.6-fold larger <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and exhibited increased neurological deficit scores after transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> compared with control mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Substrate with NB-3 promoted neuronal survival and neurite outgrowth in vitro, whereas neurite outgrowth and neuronal survival were significantly reduced in NB-3-deficient neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, NB-3 deficiency renders neurons more susceptible to oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation-induced damage and NB-3 as substrate could partially through homophilic mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that NB-3 deficiency may aggravate brain damage after middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> by impairing neuronal survival and neurite growth </plain></SENT>
