<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We present the results of endovascular photoacoustic recanalization (EPAR) treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> from the Safety and Performance Study at 6 centers in Europe and North America </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objectives of mechanical thrombolysis are rapid vessel recanalization and minimal use of chemical thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study was a prospective, nonrandomized study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) score and the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score were recorded before treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The presence of recanalization was assessed by angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To measure outcome, follow-up examinations were performed at 24 hours, 7 days, and 30 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-four patients (median NIHSS 19) were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ten patients had internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, 12 patients had middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, 11 patients had vertebrobasilar occlusion, and 1 patient had posterior cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The overall recanalization rate was 41.1% (14/34) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Complete EPAR treatment was possible in 18 patients (median NIHSS 18), with vessel recanalization in 11 patients (61.1%) after EPAR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The average lasing time was 9.65 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Incomplete EPAR treatment (16/34, median NIHSS 19) was defined as intention to treat with EPAR and that the EPAR microcatheter entered the patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Additional treatment with intraarterial application of rTPA occurred in 13 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>An adverse event associated with use of the device occurred in 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> occurred in 2 patients (5.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The mortality rate was 38.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the safety and technical feasibility of EPAR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>This new technique may provide another treatment option in the therapeutic armamentarium for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
