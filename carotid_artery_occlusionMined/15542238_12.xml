<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The molecular mechanisms responsible for differential neuronal vulnerability to ischemic injury are incompletely understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have reported that the expression and activity of protein kinase C (PKC), some subtypes of which are activated by Ca(2+) and diacylglycerol (DG), are altered after ischemic insults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, DG kinase (DGK), which is responsible for controlling PKC activity through DG metabolism, may also be involved in this process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DGKzeta, which is abundantly expressed in the brain, contains a nuclear localization signal (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NLS</z:e>), suggesting its involvement in some nuclear processes in neuronal cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To elucidate the functional implications of DGKzeta in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, we examined detailed localization of DGKzeta in rat brain after ischemic insults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We used an ischemic model of global <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> for 20 min by bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> combined with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> and followed time-points of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DGKzeta expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry using affinity-purified anti-DGKzeta antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In sham-operated rats, a strong DGKzeta-immunoreactivity was observed in the nucleus of neurons in various parts of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the global ischemic model DGKzeta-immunoreactivity was reduced in intensity in the hippocampal formation and detected in the cytoplasm of CA1 pyramidal neurons throughout reperfusion time courses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Change in the subcellular localization was restricted to the pyramidal cells in CA1 and later in CA3, but not observed in other areas of hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No change was observed in the cerebral and cerebellar cortices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The present study suggests that DGKzeta might be involved in the process of selective vulnerability of hippocampal pyramidal neurons in postischemic brain </plain></SENT>
