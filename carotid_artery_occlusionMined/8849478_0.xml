<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Brain MRI showed a hemorrhagic lesion in the right subthalamic nucleus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MRA demonstrated occlusion of the right internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cerebral angiogram indicated a leptomeningeal anastomosis to the right middle cerebral artery from the right posterior cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SPECT with 99mTc-HMPAO demonstrated the reduction of cerebral blood flow in the right frontotemporal region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Right superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery anastomosis was performed 7 months after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Monoballism disappeared after surgery and the patient had a good clinical course during the postoperative period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Monoballism associated with internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> is rare, and we were able to show the subthalamic nucleus lesion with MRI soon after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We considered that the reason for this <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> in the subthalamic nucleus was the hemodynamic stress to the posterior cerebral artery area caused by the ipsilateral occlusion of the internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
