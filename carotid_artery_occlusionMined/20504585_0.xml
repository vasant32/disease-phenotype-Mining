<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A morphological and functional characterization of the four-vessel occlusion model of transient (30 min) forebrain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> has been carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The rats were classified as fully ischemic when an isoelectric pattern of electroencephalographic activity was present within 5 min of the occlusion of carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Otherwise they were considered as partially ischemic rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The modifications of cerebral blood content during and after the ischemic insult were assessed by a histochemical method which visualizes red blood cells in cerebral vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The periods of increase and decrease of red blood cell content were found to correspond to previous reports of post-ischemic hyper- and hypoperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neuronal damage was assessed by a quantitative analysis of Nissl stained preparations of cingulate cortex, dorsal hippocampus and striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The signs of morphological damage were quantified by means of computer-assisted image analysis of Nissl preparations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The highest vulnerability to the ischemic insult was demonstrated in the pyramidal layer of the hippocampal CA1 field and in the lateral striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Arterial blood pressure measurements were performed during the ischemic and post-ischemic periods, demonstrating a peak increase of arterial blood pressure within 2 min after carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, followed by a slow decrease towards basal levels during the ischemic period and a full recovery within 15 min of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ischemic rats were tested in a neurological test battery and in a passive avoidance task </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>While a full recovery of the relatively simple tasks of the neurological test battery was attained within 14 days of reperfusion, a highly significant impairment of passive avoidance behavior was still present 15 days after the ischemic insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Finally, a discriminant analysis was applied to separate, on the basis of non-invasive techniques (neurological tests and hot plate), the group of completely ischemic rats from that of partially ischemic rats </plain></SENT>
