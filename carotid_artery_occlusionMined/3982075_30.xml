<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report herein an 8-year experience through June 1982 with 415 operations in 403 patients in whom a branch of the superficial temporal artery was anastomosed to a branch of the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients selected for operation usually had had more than one form of ischemic symptom </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary indication for operation was <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo>, and the most common vascular pathologic condition was internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Preoperatively, 183 patients were taking antiplatelet agents and 157 were taking <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neurologic function 6 months postoperatively was equal to or better than the function preoperatively in 95% of survivors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The bypass pedicle was patent in 99% of patients studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mortality and morbidity associated with the surgical procedure varied on the basis of the patient's preoperative neurologic condition but were 1% and 4%, respectively, for the entire group at 30 days postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the 54 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> during the entire follow-up period, 27 were cardiogenic and 6 were from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On the basis of patient-months of follow-up, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was 8 times more likely to occur within 6 months after operation than thereafter </plain></SENT>
