<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In contrast, spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) demonstrated small depressor responses at 50 microamperemeter and 50 Hz, but no consistent pressure or heart rate changes at either 50 or 100 muA stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The LC pressor threshold current (current necessary to increase arterial pressure by greater than or equal 10 mm Hg) was higher in SHR than WKY (136 +/- 5 muA vs. 84 +/- 7 muA; P less than 0.001); and only the SHR LC demonstrated a depressor threshold (current necessary to reduce arterial pressure by greater than or equal to 10 mm Hg) (53 +/- 3 muA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These threshold current levels did not seem to change with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> alterations of arterial pressure produced by either bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> or caortid sinus stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, these studies indicate altered levels of responsiveness of the SHR LC to stimulation but that the pressor function of the LC does not seem to be importantly involved in further elevation of abnormally high arterial pressure in the SHR </plain></SENT>
