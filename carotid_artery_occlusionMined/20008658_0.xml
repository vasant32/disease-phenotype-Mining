<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether the extent of infarction and clinical outcomes after internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion depends on the additional occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Using statistical parametric mapping, we compared <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> patterns in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: A tertiary care hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Patients with coexistent ICA and <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion (n = 25), isolated ICA occlusion (n = 20), and isolated <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion (n = 40) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Modified Rankin scale score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The independent effect of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> type on clinical outcome was estimated using logistic regression, adjusting for age and sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean age was 62.6 years (standard deviation [SD], 15.5 years) in patients with ICA and <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, 64.3 years (SD, 12.9 years) in patients with isolated ICA occlusion, and 67.4 years (SD, 14.2 years) in patients with isolated <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> patterns, volume (P = .13), and the proportion of patients with poor outcomes (P = .5) were similar between those with ICA and <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusions and those with isolated <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Compared with the other 2 groups, those with isolated ICA occlusion were less likely to have infarction of the insula (P &lt; .001) and superior temporal lobe (P &lt; .001) and had smaller <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and lower modified Rankin scale scores (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Compared with those with isolated ICA occlusion, the risk of poor clinical outcome was greater in those with coexistent ICA and <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion (P = .02) and those with isolated <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion (P = .06) independent of age and sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>COMMENTS: Patients with ICA occlusion but without coexistent <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion have different <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> patterns, less extensive <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>, and better clinical outcomes than those with coexistent <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion or <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It may not be warranted to exclude such patients from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> trials </plain></SENT>
