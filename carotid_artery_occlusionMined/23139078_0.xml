<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the outcome for patients with tandem occlusions in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> and/or distal ICA, retrospectively, who had undergone stent implantation in the proximal segment of the ICA in addition to intra-arterial thrombolysis.MATERIALS AND METHODS:Thirty-five patients with tandem occlusions of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> and/or distal ICA and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> occlusion of the proximal ICA underwent stent implantation for the proximal ICA occlusion and IAT for the tandem occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical outcome measures were assessed on admission and at discharge by using the National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale as well as 3 months after treatment by using the modified Rankin Scale.RESULTS:The median NIHSS score on admission was 12 (range, 6-22) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had patent flow into the M1 and ICA after carotid artery stent placement and IAT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After the procedure, 19 patients (54.3%) were TICI grade III; 7 (20.0%), TICI grade IIb; and 9 (25.7%), TICI grade IIa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> occurred in 1 patient (2.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The overall mortality rate was 11.4% (4/35) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At 3-month follow-up, the median NIHSS score was 4 (range, 1-17) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>NIHSS score at admission and TICI grade were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> found to be independently associated with an unfavorable outcome at 3 months.CONCLUSIONS:Initial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> severity, degree of successful revascularization, and the side of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> were found to independently predict the functional outcome at 3 months after treatment </plain></SENT>
