<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Five minutes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> significantly reduced nesting behavior for 3 days; while 10 min attenuated nesting 6 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Semi-novel re-exposure to nesting material also resulted in deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These disruptions in nesting behavior directly correlate to the amount of ischemic morphological damage and thus serve as a behavioral indicator of tissue damage </plain></SENT>
