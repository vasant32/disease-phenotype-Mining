<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hypothermic treatment was applied selectively to the brain during a 5 min carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in gerbils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Following a period of recovery, two independent measures were used to assess hippocampal function: (1) an open field test of spatial memory (assessment was made during the first 10 d after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>) and (2) measurement of evoked potentials from area CA1 in hippocampal slices (3 weeks after the ischemic episode) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The functional outcome portrayed by these tests was compared to a morphological evaluation of CA1 pyramidal cells at three rostrocaudal levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> evaluations were carried out in the same animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found converging evidence that intraischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> provides virtually complete protection against a 5 min episode of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Animals treated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> performed as well as sham-operated controls in a spatial memory task, had field potentials that were indistinguishable from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> animals and CA1 cells appeared <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> when assessed histologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> at normothermia resulted in a deficit in open field behavior (p &lt; 0.01), diminished field potentials in stratum radiatum (p &lt; 0.01), and near total loss of pyramidal cells in dorsal CA1 (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a remarkably high correlation between these diverse measures (r ranged from 0.7 to 0.9, p &lt; 0.01), which provides strong support for the use of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> as an effective treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study introduces a novel approach for the evaluation of putative anti-ischemic treatments: combining behavioral, electrophysiological, and histological measures.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
