<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The correlation between regional <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37532">phorbol ester</z:chebi> binding and cerebral blood flow (CBF) was evaluated in the gerbil brain after 2-hour unilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>[3H]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17598">phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17598">PDBu</z:chebi>) was used as a specific ligand for estimating the translocation of protein kinase C (PKC), and CBF was determined by the [<z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>]iodoantipyrine method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A quantitative autoradiographic method permitted concurrent measurement of these two parameters in the same brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> group of the animals, statistically significant, inverse correlations were noted between the CBF and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17598">PDBu</z:chebi> binding in the hippocampus (CA1 and CA3 regions and dentate gyrus), the caudate-putamen and lateral nuclei of the thalamus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In these regions, the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17598">PDBu</z:chebi> binding increased progressively as CBF fell below 35-40 ml/100 g/min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17598">PDBu</z:chebi> binding in the cerebral cortices did not show any significant changes even when CBF was decreased to below 35 ml/100 g/min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The above data suggest that (1) the translocation of PKC to the cell membrane may be regionally specific in response to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, and may remain in the regions particularly vulnerable to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> such as the hippocampus, caudate-putamen and lateral nuclei of the thalamus in the early ischemic phase; (2) the threshold of CBF below which PKC begins to translocate to the cell membrane in the above regions, may be 35-40 ml/100 g/min in 2-hour <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
