<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The same tissue sample served for the determination of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi> and energy reserve by a simple enzymatic fluoro- and spectrometric assay after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29221">perchloric acid</z:chebi> extraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>Cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> increased the levels of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi> (8- to 10-fold) and depleted the energy stores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During the first hour of recirculation, the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi> content decreased and thereafter (at 2 h), normalized in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi> content was still twice as high in the striatum and hippocampus as compared to their respective controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At the same time, an incomplete restoration of energy reserves was observed in these structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The findings indicate that <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi> is not a stable postischemic indicator of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced membrane damage </plain></SENT>
