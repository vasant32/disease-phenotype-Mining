<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: Elongation and tortuosity of the internal carotid artery (ICAET) is a common angiographic, angioMR or Duplex scanning finding: it can be "pure" and, in a great majority of cases, it is not correlated to neurological symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It can be associated with atherosclerotic bifurcation plaque, therefore in this case, indications to surgery follow that of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On the other hand in some patients ICAET seems potentially correlated to hemispheric or non hemispheric symptoms: ICAET may show as kinking with a wide or narrow <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> angle, single (&lt; shaped) or double (Z shaped), or less frequently as a coiling (S,U, or C shaped) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Surgical indications are controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the author's opinion, surgery may represent the safest tool in the prevention of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> due to carotid occlusion, in selected patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to describe the author's experience in the surgical treatment of carotid kinking not associated with significant <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From March 1994 to March 2001, 29 patients (11 male, 18 female) with a pure ICAET underwent surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients presented hemispheric symptoms (24.13%), non hemispheric symptoms (41.3%) or both (27.5 %) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two asymptomatic patients (6.9%) underwent surgery because of contralateral carotid occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The postoperative (within 30 days from operation) results, no mortality was observed, 1 patient presented a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (3.4%), and 1 patient had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> at awakening (negative cerebral CT scan) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with hemispheric symptoms (15 patients) had complete remission, whereas only 6 out of 12 patients (50%) presenting non-hemispheric symptoms had remission (1 patient underwent a controlateral ICAET correction) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The natural history of symptomatic and asymptomatic ICAET is practically unknown, but in some cases selected indication to surgery is justified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Surgery was indicated for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tia|TIA|T.I.A.">transient ischaemic attacks</z:e> ( hemispheric symptoms); in asymptomatic patients presenting a kinking with an angle inferior to 30 degrees, and a contralateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>; in patients with non hemispheric symptoms, after a screening to exclude <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other possible neurological or non-neurological causes with duplex scan positive for significant increase of flow velocity in ICA and positive cerebral CT scan or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> scan for ischaemic lesions in the homolateral hemisphere, and/or a flow inversion in anterior cerebral artery or flow reduction in the middle cerebral artery, according to different head positions (rotation and flex-extension) </plain></SENT>
