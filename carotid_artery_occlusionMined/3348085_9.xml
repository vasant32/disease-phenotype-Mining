<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The interval of 1 h was chosen to allow for the development of post-ischemic hypoperfusion between the ischemic episodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three minutes and 1 h after each ischemic episode, and 6 and 24 h after the third occlusion, Evan's blue (EB) was injected intravenously to trace circulating blood, and the number of perfused capillaries was determined in various brain regions by fluorescence microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>Brain edema</z:hpo> was evaluated by measuring specific gravity in tissue samples taken from adjacent areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Repetitive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> caused progressively increasing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> and a progressive reduction of the number of perfused capillaries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immediately after each ischemic episode, transient recruitment of capillaries occurred, thus excluding no-reflow as a main pathogenetic factor of microcirculatory disturbances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The pattern of microcirculation 6 and 24 h after the last occlusion revealed a redistribution of circulating blood, characterized by a reduction in the number of EB-filled capillaries associated with a noticeable <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of the larger vascular channels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our studies suggest a close interrelationship between post-ischemic microcirculatory hypoperfusion and the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo>, the degree and extent of which progresses with the repetition of ischemic episodes when they are carried out during the periods of hypoperfusion </plain></SENT>
