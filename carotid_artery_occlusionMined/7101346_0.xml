<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In normoxic brain <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8461">promethazine</z:chebi> (25-100 mg/kg-1) was associated with unaltered adenylates, increased <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi> and decreased <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> and malate; a pattern which was compatible with cerebral metabolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hypoxemic animals receiving either saline or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8461">promethazine</z:chebi> (25 mg/kg-1) showed equivalent decreases in ATP and increases in <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> which indicated that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8461">promethazine</z:chebi> had no significant effect on the metabolism of the acutely hypoxic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In animals exposed to hypoxemia plus right carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (oligemia) the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8461">promethazine</z:chebi> treated group (25 mg/kg-1) showed significantly lower ATP and higher <z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi> contents which suggested an adverse effect on the metabolism of the acutely hypoxic-oligemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8461">promethazine</z:chebi> does not beneficially alter the energy metabolism of the acutely hypoxic or hypoxic-oligemic brain </plain></SENT>
