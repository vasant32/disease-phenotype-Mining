<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These phenomena were examined to determine if an association could be made between the site or degree of <z:mp ids='MP_0002229'>neuronal degeneration</z:mp> and the increase in locomotor activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The distance traveled by the BCO gerbils in a novel cage 1, 4, and 28 days after a 5 min occlusion was significantly greater than control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The extensive pyramidal cell damage in the CA1 region of the hippocampus in BCO gerbils was associated with the significant increase in locomotor activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The increase in locomotor activity did not correlate with either the striatal or cortical damage present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The increase in gerbil locomotor activity following a 5 min BCO can be used as a predictor of CA1 damage, but not as a predictor of striatal or cortical damage </plain></SENT>
