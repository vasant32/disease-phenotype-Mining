<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Controversy about the optimal method of performing a carotid endarterectomy (CEA) exists despite its widespread application and support from various randomized clinical trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Many surgeons selectively or routinely use electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring as well as shunting when performing this operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>ETHODS: We conducted this retrospective study to assess the maximum carotid clamp time without shunting or EEG monitoring during a CEA without the development of neurological deficits in an already compromised cerebral circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifteen consecutive patients who underwent CEAs between 1988 and 1999 met our criteria of angiographically documented ipsilateral internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis with contralateral ICA occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient presentations included asymptomatic (14%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>) (50%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (36%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were operated under general anesthesia without shunting and only 4 patients underwent EEG monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On angiography, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 15 patients had ipsilateral ICA stenosis (70-99%) and contralateral occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 54% of patients, the vertebral arteries (VAs) were both patent, while in 46% of patients only 1 VA was patent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eighty-five percent of patients had at least 1 patent anterior communicating (Pcomm) artery, while 15% had nonvisualized Pcomm arteries bilaterally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of the 15 patients, 14 had a patent anterior communicating artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mean clamp time of the CCA was 18.5 minutes (range 14-30 minutes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>None of the 15 patients had new neurological changes immediately postoperatively or during the 6 weeks of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We propose that shunting may not be necessary during CEA for high-grade stenosis with contralateral ICA occlusion, presumably because of adequate distal small vessel collaterals </plain></SENT>
