<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Seven-day postnatal rats received a subcutaneous injection of either IAP (5 microCi) of IPIA (10 microCi), two minutes following which the animals were sacrificed and their brains prepared for quantitative autoradiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Blood flows to cerebral cortex, hippocampus, striatum, thalamus and hypothalamus were comparable using the two methods, whereas blood flows to white matter structures were substantially higher (+ 64-85%) with IAP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Spatial resolution, especially of the gray matter structures, was greater with IPIA than with IAP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (unilateral common carotid artery ligation and <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> with 8% oxygen), blood flows to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> regions of the ipsilateral cerebral hemisphere were not different from control at 10 and 20 min </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A columnar or patchy distribution of preferential perfusion was seen within the cerebral cortex, striatum and thalamus, with IPIA, which corresponds closely to the pathologic pattern of injury seen within these structures of the immature rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Such a preferential perfusion was not seen in hippocampus, in which metabolic factors (intrinsic vulnerability) most likely predict the distribution of hypoxic-ischemic brain damage </plain></SENT>
