<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the anatomic and vascular predictors of MI-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: The authors evaluated 192 consecutive autopsies of patients with nonlacunar <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> affecting the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MI-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> was defined by an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> with temporal or central brain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019270" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herniation</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527311" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain swelling</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The autopsy protocol included a systematic analysis of intracranial arteries (including the bony segments of carotid and vertebral arteries and the circle of Willis), extracranial arteries, the aortic arch, and the heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 45 patients with MI-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Their median (range) survival time was 6 (0 to 20) days as compared with 18 (0 to 2,040) days for non-MI-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with non-MI-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>, MI-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> cases more frequently involved the superficial and deep <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory and were more frequently associated with anterior cerebral and anterior choroidal artery territory <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Hemorrhagic transformation, Duret <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp>, carotid occlusion, and ipsilateral abnormalities of the circle of Willis were also more frequent (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multivariable analysis showed that younger age, female sex, absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> history, higher heart weight, carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, and abnormal circle of Willis ipsilaterally were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> independently associated with MI-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> (p &lt; 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Typical pathologic pattern for development of malignant infarction of the middle cerebral artery is a carotid occlusion with abnormal ipsilateral circle of Willis in a young patient who had a first-ever large hemispheric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> including the superficial territory with possibly a slight predominance of female sex </plain></SENT>
