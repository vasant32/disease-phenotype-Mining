<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: For patients with internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> with advanced narrowing of the ipsilateral external carotid artery (ECA), we performed preventive carotid endarterectomy (CEA) for the ECA stenosis before superficial temporal artery (STA) to middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) anastomosis for internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between August 2002 and July 2005, we treated seven patients with such lesions, six men and one woman, ranging in age from 52 to 66 years (median, 60 yr) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Before STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis, we performed preventive CEA for advanced ECA stenosis (&gt;70%) to ensure sufficient blood flow to the STA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> double anastomoses were performed more than 1 month after the CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Postoperative cerebrovascular complications and carotid restenosis were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients in the present series had an excellent postoperative course without cerebrovascular complications during either the CEA or STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, no postoperative carotid restenosis occurred, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomoses were patent during a mean follow-up period of 35.6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The present study suggests that surgical management by external CEA followed by STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis is safe and effective for patients with internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and advanced stenosis of the ipsilateral ECA </plain></SENT>
