<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Test balloon occlusion of the internal carotid artery was performed in 17 patients, and 99mTc-HMPAO was injected intravenously while the balloon was inflated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The balloon was deflated and removed approximately 15-20 min later, and single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission CT (SPECT) imaging of the brain was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In patients with an area of focal hypoperfusion, the 99mTc-HMPAO study was repeated the next day to determine if the hypoperfusion was due to the temporary balloon occlusion or to a preexisting abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 17 patients had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> neurologic examinations at the time of the balloon test occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fifteen had symmetric perfusion on the 99mTc-HMPAO SPECT scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five of these had permanent internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, and four did not develop a neurologic deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One patient developed an ipsilateral watershed infarction after internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> during significant intraoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two patients had ipsilateral regions of hypoperfusion with the test occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both these patients had repeat nonocclusion 99mTc-HMPAO SPECT studies that were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One patient is being followed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The second patient had ipsilateral EEG changes associated with temporary intraoperative occlusion of the internal carotid artery during <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Although the numbers are relatively small, this study suggests that this protocol may be able to predict a good outcome after permanent carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> as well as to identify patients who are at greater risk for developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> after permanent occlusion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
