<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We present two cases of common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> that were treated by vascular reconstruction using the transverse cervical artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two patients with common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> resulting from decreased cerebral blood flow on the affected side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both patients underwent vascular reconstruction using the transverse cervical artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The transverse cervical artery was anastomosed to the ipsilateral external carotid artery at its origin, as a pedicle graft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery anastomosis was then performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The postoperative courses were uneventful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The transverse cervical artery bypass grafts were patent, and cerebral blood flow increased to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Transverse cervical artery grafting provides a less tedious alternative to saphenous vein interposition grafting for revascularization of the internal carotid artery domain </plain></SENT>
