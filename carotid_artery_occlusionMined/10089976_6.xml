<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective chart review of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases undergoing planned carotid artery resection for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent disease</z:e> at a major university hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: If the carotid artery was encased, a nonemergent carotid artery balloon test occlusion was performed for 30 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>If the patient tolerated this, he or she underwent permanent carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-three patients were prospectively evaluated for resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three underwent emergent carotid artery ligation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty others underwent nonemergent carotid artery test occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of these, 5 patients failed preoperative carotid artery balloon occlusion and 15 patients successfully underwent permanent carotid balloon occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although eight of these patients died of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent disease</z:e> in less than 1 year, seven patients survived more than 1 year with two patients surviving more than 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative carotid balloon occlusion predicted patients who could tolerate permanent occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients eventually developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent disease</z:e>, but in 14 of the 15 patients, no <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> occurred </plain></SENT>
