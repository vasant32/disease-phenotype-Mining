<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A fast compartment flow rate and an initial slope index were computed for each detector and for each hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The clinical presentation, angiographic findings, and rCBF results were then examined for significant correlations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with hemispheric infarction most frequently showed bilateral diffusely decreased rCBF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo>, no specific pattern emerged </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with severe internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> were more likely to show decreased rCBF than were patients with mild or moderate stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The initial slope index seemed to be a more sensitive indicator of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> than the fast compartment flow rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The possible pathophysiological significance and relationship to patient management of the various rCBF patterns are discussed </plain></SENT>
