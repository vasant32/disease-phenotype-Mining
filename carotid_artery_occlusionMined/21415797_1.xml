<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We report our experience of patency of arterial pedicle grafts and interposition vein grafts for the purpose of EC-IC bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed 294 consecutive patients who underwent 178 intracranial arterial pedicle bypass procedures and 152 intracranial vein bypass procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Bypass patency was assessed by digital subtraction angiography, computed tomographic angiography, and/or Doppler ultrasound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The modified Rankin Scale (mRS) was assigned for clinical grading at the last follow-up consultation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The main indication for arterial pedicle bypass surgery was internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (79 cases); for vein bypass surgery, it was giant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> (61 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Procedure-related complications due to surgery occurred in 3 cases (1.7%; 95% CI: 0.4-5.1%) of arterial pedicle bypass surgery and 12 cases (7.9%; 95% CI: 4.5-13.4%) of vein bypass surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patency rate at 6 weeks was 98% (95% CI: 95.0-99.7%) for arterial pedicle bypass and 93% (95% CI: 87.4-96%) for vein bypass, with almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> graft failures occurring within the first week following surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Beyond the first week, bypass patency was similar for both groups, with both arterial pedicle grafts and vein bypass grafts that were patent at 1 week having a long-term patency of 99% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no statistically significant difference in early, late, and overall patency between the 2 bypass groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The surgical complication rate was greater for vein bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Both arterial pedicle and vein bypass have good long-term patency </plain></SENT>
