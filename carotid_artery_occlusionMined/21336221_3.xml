<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Reperfusion therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> (AIS) is rapidly evolving, with the development of multiple endovascular modalities that can be used alone or in combination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine which pharmacologic or mechanical modality may be associated with increased rates of recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A cohort of 1122 patients with AIS involving the anterior circulation treated at 13 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> centers underwent intra-arterial (IA) therapy within 8 hours of symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Demographic information, admission National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS), mechanical and pharmacologic treatments used, recanalization grade, and hemorrhagic complications were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean age was 67 Â± 16 years and the median NIHSS was 17 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The sites of <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> before treatment were M1 middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) in 561 (50%) patients, carotid terminus in 214 (19%) patients, M2 <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> in 171 (15%) patients, tandem occlusions in 141 (13%) patients, and isolated extracranial internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in 35 (3%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therapeutic interventions included multimodal therapy in 584 (52%) patients, pharmacologic therapy only in 264 (24%) patients, and mechanical therapy only in 274 (24%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients treated with multimodal therapy had a significantly higher Thrombolysis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>Myocardial Infarction</z:hpo> 2 or 3 recanalization rate (435 patients [74%]) compared with pharmacologic therapy only (160 patients, [61%]) or mechanical only therapy (173 patients [63%]), P&lt;.001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In binary logistic regression modeling, independent predictors of Thrombolysis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>Myocardial Infarction</z:hpo> 2 or 3 recanalization were use of IA thrombolytic OR 1.58 (1.21-2.08), P&lt;.001 and stent deployment 1.91 (1.23-2.96), P&lt;.001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Multimodal therapy has significantly higher recanalization rates compared with pharmacologic or mechanical therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Among the individual treatment modalities, stent deployment or IA thrombolytics increase the chance of recanalization </plain></SENT>
