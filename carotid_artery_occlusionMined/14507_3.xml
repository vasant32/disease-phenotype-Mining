<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To elucidate the mechanism of the renal blood flow redistribution, carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was performed in anesthetized dogs with the left kidney either having renal perfusion pressure maintained constant (aortic constriction) or having alpha-adrenergic receptor blockade (phenoxybenzamine); the right kidney of the same dog served to document the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When renal perfusion pressure was maintained constant, renal blood flow distribution (microspheres) was unchanged by carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the presence of renal alpha-adrenergic receptor blockade, carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> elicited the usual redistribution of renal blood flow from inner to outer cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The redistribution of renal blood flow observed after carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> is mediated by the increase in renal perfusion pressure rather than the increase in renal sympathetic nerve activity </plain></SENT>
