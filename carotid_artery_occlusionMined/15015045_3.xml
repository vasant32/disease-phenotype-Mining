<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Surgical treatment of patients with suspected internal carotid artery (ICA) pseudo-occlusion and reduced cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) is still uncertain regarding the diagnostic procedures, the risks and the optimal timing as well as performance of revascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: From 1983-2001, 781 patients with symptomatic ICA stenosis were treated surgically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 53 patients, a final diagnosis of extracranial ICA pseudo-occlusion was established by repeating Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Angiographical findings were anterograde "string-like" filling of ICA beyond the carotid bifurcation or retrograde filling of the proximal, so called "occluded" extracranial ICA, extending up to the skull base </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The CVR was reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent direct surgery of extracranial carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic parameters, peri-operative risks and postoperative course of these patients were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: In 40 patients (75.5%) a successful revascularization of ICA was possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ICA pseudo-occlusion was in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of atheromatous origin, moreover in 8 patients combined with a floating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e>, distal to the stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thrombectomy was done by means of Fogarty catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In 13 patients (24.5%), a surgical re-opening of the ICA lumen was not possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Five of these patients showed in DSA an anterograde "string sign", eight presented retrograde filling of ICA reaching the skull base </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Peri-operative mortality was 1.9%, peri-operative morbidity was 7.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>After a 4 years (mean) follow-up, 95% of the reopened ICA remained patent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In patients with explicit carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> signs, careful selective DSA should be compulsory with a late series to detect ICA pseudo-occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>There is a chance for extracranial reopening ICA, even with compromised CVR, if anterograde "string like" or retrograde filling of proximal so called "occluded" ICA as far as the skull base is angiographically identified </plain></SENT>
