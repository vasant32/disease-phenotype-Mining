<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study sought to evaluate whether patients at increased perioperative risk for CEA may be treated with CAS while maintaining equivalent outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study was a nonblinded, retrospective analysis of data obtained from September 2002 to present in the CAS group and from January 1997 to present in the CEA group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two hundred thirty-one CAS and 647 CEA procedures were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were selected for CAS based on criteria that placed them at increased risk for standard CEA surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Except for percentage women treated, baseline demographics did not differ between patients treated with CAS and CEA: mean age (72.0 years [range 46-94] vs 70.5 years [range 42-92], P = NS), mean follow-up (12.8 +/- 11.8 months vs 8.7 +/- 10.0 months, P = NS) and percentage women treated (41.4% vs 32.3%, P = .03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cerebral protection devices were used in 228/231 patients treated with CAS, and each patient underwent an NIH <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale assessment 24 hours postoperatively and at 30 days follow-up by an independent observer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Preoperative neurologic symptoms did not differ between patients treated with CAS and CEA: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100576'>amaurosis fugax</z:hpo> (6.06% vs 6.96%, P = NS), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> (13.4% vs 13.9%, P = NS), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> (19.9% vs 14.1%, P = NS) and total symptoms (27.7% vs 30.5%, P = NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Due to the selection of patient groups based on predefined clinical characteristics, factors associated with an increased risk of complications from standard CEA surgery were generally more prevalent in patients treated with CAS: neck irradiation (6.06% vs 1.24%, P &lt; .001), neck dissection for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> therapy (7.8% vs 1.5%, P &lt; .001), prior ipsilateral CEA (15.2% vs 3.4%, P &lt;/= .001), contralateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (12.1% vs 1.1%, P &lt; .001), modified Goldman Cardiac Risk II-moderate risk (26.0% vs 11.3%, P &lt; .001) and modified Goldman Cardiac Risk III-high risk (16.4% vs 2.1%, P &lt; .001) in patients treated with CAS and CEA, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Perioperative outcomes did not differ between patients treated with CAS and CEA: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (MI) (1.7% vs 2.6%, P = NS), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> without residual symptoms (1.3% vs 1.2%, P = NS), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> with residual symptoms (0.4% vs 0.8%, P = NS), mortality (0.4% vs 0.6%, P = NS), and total MI/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>/mortality rate (3.9% vs 5.3%, P = NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The data in this study demonstrate that high-risk patients undergoing CAS had comparable outcomes to low-risk patients undergoing CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This study supports the use of CAS as a reasonable alternative for patients at increased perioperative risk for CEA </plain></SENT>
