<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To demonstrate the efficacy of carotid duplex ultrasound to diagnose common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (CCAO) and to define the clinical features of CCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed 5400 carotid duplex ultrasonograms obtained over a 7-year period for suspected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In cases of CCAO, medical records were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirteen cases (0.24%) of CCAO were diagnosed by carotid duplex ultrasonography, including five cases of isolated CCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seven cases were proved by cerebral angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cerebral angiography failed to demonstrate patent internal carotid arteries in two cases of isolated CCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> was 67 +/- 9 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The main clinical presentation was <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in nine cases (69%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The most common vascular risk factors were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (62%) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart diseases</z:e> (54%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three patients had a history of radiation therapy to the neck </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two of five patients with isolated CCAO had major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, with good recovery in one, whereas five of eight patients with CCAO had major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>; among them, only one had good recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patients with isolated CCAO may have a better outcome than patients with CCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Duplex sonography, particularly with color-coded flow imaging, provides an accurate examination to define the patency of the arteries distal to the carotid bifurcation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The clinical features of CCAO are similar to those of internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> except for the low prevalence of CCAO </plain></SENT>
