<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A prospective series of 875 CEAs done using regional anesthesia were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were operated upon under the direction of one neurosurgeon (REH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical outcomes measures evaluated were any <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> within 30 days of operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were followed to a clinical endpoint and/or six weeks post-operatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The incidence of adverse clinical outcomes in the suspected high risk patients was compared to the incidence in the entire series using contingency table analysis (Chi-square and Fisher's exact test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> (2.3%), four <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarctions</z:hpo> (0.5%) and three <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (0.3%) occurred within 30 days of CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>None of the suspected risk factors was associated with a significantly (p &lt; 0.05) increased risk of peri-operative morbidity or mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CEA using regional anesthesia can be performed in patients with advanced age, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, atherosclerotic coronary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> and contralateral ICA occlusion with acceptably low peri-operative morbidity </plain></SENT>
