<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: to evaluate early and mid-term term results of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in patient with and without contralateral carotid occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: between 1996 and 1999, 1324 CEAs were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 82 patients contralateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was present (group I); 1242 patients had patent contralateral carotid (group II) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were operated under general anaesthesia, and selective shunting was based on somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ultrasonographic follow-up was performed at 1, 6 and 12 months and then once a year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Early results and follow-up data were analysed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: in group I there was a significantly higher incidence of SEPs reduction and shunt insertion; however, there were no differences in terms of perioperative complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cumulative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate at 30 days in group 1 and group 2 were 2.4% vs 1.4% (p=n.s.), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At a mean follow-up of 15 months there were no differences between the two groups in terms of cumulative symptom-free survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS:the presence of contralateral carotid occlusion caused an increased use of shunt, but not in early complications rates </plain></SENT>
