<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A man with orthostatic-mediated right-sided limb <z:mp ids='MP_0000745'>shaking</z:mp> was found to have total left internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There was prominent reduction of cerebrovascular reserve seen on single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography (SPECT) performed with and without acetazolomide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During assumption of an upright position transcranial Doppler (TCD) revealed a marked attenuation of the left middle cerebral artery flow pattern not associated with changes during electroencephalographic monitoring, even after administration of acetazolomide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this man, limb <z:mp ids='MP_0000745'>shaking</z:mp> episodes were attributed to hypoperfusion of the contralateral cerebral hemisphere, and not to epileptogenic activity </plain></SENT>
