<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mice were subjected to BCCAO, and circulation was restored after 20 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Alaternin (10 mg/kg, p.o) treatment significantly prevented nitrotyrosine and <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation, as well as BCCAO induced-inducible nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (iNOS) expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Alaternin also significantly reduced microglial activation (a marker of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The number of viable neurons detected by Nissl staining increased with alaternin (10 mg/kg, p.o) treatment at 7 days post-BCCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the passive avoidance task, alaternin significantly ameliorated BCCAO-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairments</z:hpo> (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the neuroprotective effects of alaternin are mediated by its anti-inflammatory and radical scavenging activities </plain></SENT>
