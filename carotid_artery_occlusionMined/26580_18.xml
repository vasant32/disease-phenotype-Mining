<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In contrast to papaverine, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="8364">prazosin</z:chebi> failed to produce the same effect in dogs under spinal anaesthesia even when the intrinsic femoral vascular tone was increased with vasopressin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilator</z:chebi> effects of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="8364">prazosin</z:chebi> were again observed when the tone of the limb was elevated by either stimulating the sympathetic lumbar chain or by infusing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35569">alpha-adrenoceptor agonists</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A significant reduction of both aortic blood pressure and pressor response to bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was noted in a group of normotensive dogs anaesthetised 12 h after the last dose of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="8364">prazosin</z:chebi> given twice daily at 0.5 mg/kg, p.o., for 3 day period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This short-term treatment modified neither the resting heart rate nor the positive chronotropic effect induced by either intravenous <z:chebi fb="15" ids="33569">noradrenaline</z:chebi> or electrical stimulation of pre- and post-ganglionic nerve fibres of the right stellate ganglion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, it prevented the larger increase in heart rate in response to bilateral carotid occlusion in placebo-treated dogs after section of the vagi </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A decrease in baseline sympathetic tone of the perfused hind limb as well as vasoconstrictor effects produced by i.a. injections of several <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35569">alpha-adrenoceptor agonists</z:chebi> and electrical stimulation of the lumbar sympathetic chain was observed in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="8364">prazosin</z:chebi>-treated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The dose--pressor response profiles to these alpha-adrenoceptor stimulants after <z:chebi fb="1" ids="8364">prazosin</z:chebi> were not parallel to those obtained in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The vasoconstrictor response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> was not changed by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="8364">prazosin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In rabbit aortic strips, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="8364">prazosin</z:chebi> (0.1--3.0 micrometer) produced competitive antagonism of the contractile responses induced by cirazoline, <z:chebi fb="15" ids="33569">noradrenaline</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8093">phenylephrine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast to papaverine, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="8364">prazosin</z:chebi> in concentrations up to 100.0 micrometer neither relaxed the aortic strips contracted by <z:chebi fb="3" ids="29103">potassium ions</z:chebi> nor modified the concentration-response curve to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="39124">calcium ions</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These studies indicate that blood pressure lowering effects of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="8364">prazosin</z:chebi> given acutely or for three days can be accounted for by a clear-cut functional impairment of vascular postsynaptic alpha-adrenoceptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No evidence for a direct myorelaxant property of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="8364">prazosin</z:chebi> could be obtained in these studies </plain></SENT>
