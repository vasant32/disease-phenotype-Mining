<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We examined whether 7-Cl-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="29830">thio</z:chebi>-kynurenate, a potent <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> at the glycine site of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">N-methyl-D-aspartate</z:chebi> receptor which also inhibits <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation, protected CA1 pyramidal cells following transient forebrain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was produced in anesthetized gerbils by 5 min bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>; hippocampal injury was assessed seven days later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>7-Cl-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="29830">thio</z:chebi>-kynurenate (100 mg/kg, i.p. x 5) dramatically attenuated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced CA1 cell loss (from 95 +/- 1 to 7 +/- 3%): the protection was associated with a delayed and marked reduction in the animals' temperature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, when the gerbils were maintained normothermic for at least 360 min, 7-Cl-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="29830">thio</z:chebi>-kynurenate still provided partial (54 +/- 11%) but significant protection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No protection was observed when a reduction in temperature with a time course similar to that caused by 7-Cl-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="29830">thio</z:chebi>-kynurenate was experimentally induced in saline-treated ischemic animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In situ hybridization revealed that expression of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi>-R1, a subunit of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">N-methyl-D-aspartate</z:chebi> receptor, was selectively reduced in CA1 seven days following global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In ischemic gerbils treated with 7-Cl-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="29830">thio</z:chebi>-kynurenate, protected CA1 cells were still able to express <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> amounts of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi>-R1 <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrate that 7-Cl-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="29830">thio</z:chebi>-kynurenate, a <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> receptor blocker possessing radical scavenger properties, is effective in reducing CA1 hippocampal damage following global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in the gerbil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Since there is growing evidence that a positive feedback interaction between activation of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> receptors and free radical formation may be responsible for the generation of ischemic brain damage, drugs capable of interfering with both pathogenic mechanisms may be useful in preventing post-ischemic neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
