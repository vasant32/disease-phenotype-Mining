<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The presence of pericytes in brain regions undergoing repair is evident of the recruitment of bone marrow-derived multipotent regenerative cells to the neurovascular unit during <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At present, post mortem sampling is the only way to identify them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, such cell typing is inadequate for preserving neural progenitor cells for any meaningful stem cell therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We aimed to target cerebral pericytes in vivo using dual gene transcript-targeted MRI (GT-tMRI) in male C57black6 mice after a 60-min bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (BCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We attached superparamagnetic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50822">iron oxide nanoparticles</z:chebi> (SPIONs) to phosphorothioate-modified micro-DNA that targets actin or nestin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Because BCAO compromises the blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) and induces expression of α-smooth muscle (αSM)-actin and nestin antigens by pericytes in new vessels, we delivered pericyte-specific magnetic resonance contrast agents (SPION-actin or SPION-nestin at 4 mg Fe/kg) by i.p. injection to C57black6 mice that had experienced BCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated that the surge in cerebral iron content by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry matched the increase in the frequency of relaxivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We also found that SPION-nestin was colocalized in αSM- actin- and nestin-expressing pericytes in BCAO-treated C57black6 or transgenic mice [B6.Cg-Tg(CAG-mRFP1) 1F1Hadj/J, expressing red fluorescent protein by actin promoter] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We identified pericytes in the repair patch in living brains after BCAO with a voxel size of 0.03 mm(3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The presence of electron-dense nanoparticles in vascular pericytes in the region of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> injury led us to draw the conclusion that GT-tMRI can noninvasively reveal neural progenitor cells during vascularization </plain></SENT>
