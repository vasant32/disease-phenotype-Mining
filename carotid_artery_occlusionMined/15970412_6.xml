<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study we evaluated neuroprotective/cerebroprotective actions of KGT in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, using rat global and focal models of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Varied biochemical/enzymatic alterations, produced subsequent to the application of middle cerebral artery (MCAO) and bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (BCAO) followed by reperfusion viz. increase in <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation (LPO) and decrease in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> (GSH), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> reductase (GR), catalase (CAT), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi>-S-transferase (GST), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> peroxidase (GPx) and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (SOD), were markedly reversed and restored to near <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels in the groups pre-treated with KGT (350 mg/kg given orally for 10 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the protective action, exhibited by KGT against hypoperfusion/reperfusion induced brain injury, suggests its therapeutic potential in cerebrovascular diseases (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e>) including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings are important because: (a) the present treatment strategies for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVD</z:e> are far from adequate and (b) KGT with wide usage is known to be a safe natural product </plain></SENT>
