<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether the plasma brain natriuretic <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> (BNP) level on admission can serve as a biological marker of in-hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tia|TIA|T.I.A.">transient ischaemic attack</z:e> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>) patients with AF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: we prospectively enrolled ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> patients with AF within 24 h of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and measured plasma BNP on admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into two groups: the deceased group, who died during hospitalization, and the survival group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The factors associated with in-hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were investigated by multivariate logistic regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: a total of 221 patients with AF were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>Death</z:hpo> occurred in 24 (10.9%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean ± SD of the plasma BNP level of the deceased group was significantly higher than that of the survival group (714.1 ± 716.3 vs. 320.0 ± 380.7 pg/ml, P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The optimal cutoff level, sensitivity, and specificity of BNP levels to distinguish the deceased group from the survival group were 320 pg/ml, 79.2, and 69.0%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that age per 10 years increase (OR, 3.56; 95% CI, 1.728-7.346, P = 0.0006), internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (OR, 10.20; 95% CI, 2.525-41.177, P = 0.0011), NIHSS score of &gt;17 (OR, 4.68; 95% CI, 1.137-19.286, P = 0.0325), and plasma BNP level of &gt; 320 pg/ml (OR, 4.74; 95% CI, 1.260-17.800, P = 0.0213) were independent factors associated with in-hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: the plasma BNP level on admission can predict in-hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> patients with AF </plain></SENT>
