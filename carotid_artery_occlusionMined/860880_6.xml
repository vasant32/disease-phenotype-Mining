<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The overall incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was 10.7% and the mortality 3.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>From these 317 operations a standardized series of 253 operations performed on neurologically stable patients was analyzed for neurologic complications as related to the use of an intra-operative shunt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additional factors studied were length of time of carotid occlusion and degree of contralateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>From the standardized series the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in 137 shunted cases was 9.5%, and in 116 non-shunted cases was 0.9%, a significant difference (p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> times from 30 seconds to 12 minutes in the shunted group, and three minutes to 24 minutes in the non-shunted group had no relationship to the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Significant contralateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp>, present in 28/137 shunted cases and 30/116 non-shunted cases, had no predictive value in the development of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The use of an intra-operative shunt did not protect against <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in these patients </plain></SENT>
