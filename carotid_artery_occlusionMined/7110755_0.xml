<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>ISO increased heart rat (HR), while NOR and CAR produced comparatively little chronotropic response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Phentolamine (1 mg/kg) considerably reduced induced increases in dP/dt, Vmax and HR, while the same dose of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8499">propranolol</z:chebi> almost completely abolished such increases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that phentolamine, and alpha-adrenergic blocking drug, does have and ability to partially block induced positive inotropic responses in the canine heart, and perhaps chronotropic responses as well, although <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8499">propranolol</z:chebi>, a beta-blocker, is more effective. the results are in accord with the view that the principal cardiac adrenergic receptors are not adequately described either as classical beta- or alpha-adrenergic receptors </plain></SENT>
