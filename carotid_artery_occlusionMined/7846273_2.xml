<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both methods are compared with transcranial Doppler sonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There is a good correlation of the three methods in the changes in cerebral oxygen saturation and in blood velocity following <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> stimulation of cerebral blood flow, except found in one patient with unilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this patient we found a decreased cerebrovascular reserve capacity, revealed by a magnetic resonance technique designed to quantify CBV and CBF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We postulate a raised oxygen extraction as the cause of his changes in oxygen saturation </plain></SENT>
