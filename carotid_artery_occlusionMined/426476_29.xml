<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In typical SC the nucleus was eccentric and the Nissl substance was lost in the central eosinophilic cytoplasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In electron micrographs this area of cytoplasm showed disruption of smooth and rough endoplasmic reticulum with disaggregation of polyribosomes and accumulation of mitochrondria and various dense bodies </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> lasted 5 to 6 minutes, SC was seen in the hippocampal Sommer sector and cerebral cortex, while <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICC</z:e> was restricted to the endfolium (h3-5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Unlike <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICC</z:e>, the frequency of SC was not related to the duration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> but probably to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epileptic</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> (overt and subclinical) initiated by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in the gerbil </plain></SENT>
