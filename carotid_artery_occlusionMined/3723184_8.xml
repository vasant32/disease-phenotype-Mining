<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Arteriography demonstrated a left intrapetrous carotid artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patient was successfully treated with a left superficial temporal artery to middle cerebral artery bypass followed by balloon entrapment of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There have been at least 40 previously reported cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of the petrous portion of the carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> can be mycotic, traumatic, or developmental in origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They can present with massive otorrhagia or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000421'>epistaxis</z:hpo> from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> rupture or with decreased hearing and <z:mp ids='MP_0000754'>paresis</z:mp> of the fifth through eighth cranial nerves and, less frequently, of the ninth, 10th, and 12th cranial nerves caused by direct pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>They can also produce <z:hpo ids='HP_0008629'>pulsatile tinnitus</z:hpo>, and sometimes they are discovered as a retrotympanic vascular mass during otological examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The treatment of choice is carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Trapping of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> by detachable balloons eliminates immediately the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, offers the possibility of test occlusion of the internal carotid artery with the patient awake prior to permanent occlusion, and should also reduce the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It should be preceded by a bypass procedure when preliminary evaluation indicates that the patient will not tolerate internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
