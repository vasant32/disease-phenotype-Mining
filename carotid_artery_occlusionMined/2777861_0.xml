<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Over a four-year period at this institution 104 patients underwent carotid endarterectomy for stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this group the contralateral carotid was patent (Group A) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifty-four patients with unilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> underwent contralateral endarterectomy (Group B), 8 underwent ECA/ICA bypass (Group C) and 4 an ECA endarterectomy (Group D) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No statistically significant difference was noted in perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rates for Groups A and B were (1% and 1%) and (3.7% and 1.9%) respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One Group C patient died from perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (12.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For late events the life table adjusted annual rates for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and mortality were similar, Group A (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> 2.1% and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> 5%), and Group B (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> 1.6% and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> 5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In Group C <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate was 10% and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> 3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> four patients undergoing ECA endarterectomy were relieved of their symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that in patients with internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> <z:chebi fb="29" ids="28621,35026">TEA</z:chebi> may be performed with perioperative morbidity and mortality rates comparable to those when the opposite carotid artery is patent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The late outcome for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> compares favorably with the reported natural history of the disease and outcome for such patients treated medically in the Joint Study of Extracranial Occlusion and EC-IC Bypass Study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>External carotid artery endarterectomy appears useful in the treatment of embolic events on the occluded side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>ECA/ICA bypass does not appear to confer benefit </plain></SENT>
