<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> treated with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator in 10 Japanese <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> centers were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 600 patients (377 men, 72+/-12 years old) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Median National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale scores decreased from 13 before recombinant tissue plasminogen activator to 8 at 24 hours later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> within 36 hours with a &gt;or=1-point increase from the baseline National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale score developed in 23 patients (3.8%; 95% CI, 2.6% to 5.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 3 months, 43 patients had died (7.2%; 5.4% to 9.5%), and 199 patients (33.2%; 29.5% to 37.0%) had a modified Rankin Scale score &lt;or=1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analysis of 399 patients with a premorbid modified Rankin Scale score &lt;or=1 who met the criteria of the European license (&lt;or=80 years old, an initial National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale score &lt;or=24, etc) showed that 40.6% (35.9% to 45.5%) had a 3-month modified Rankin Scale score &lt;or=1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After multivariate adjustment, younger age, lower initial National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale score, absence of internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, higher Alberta <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Program Early CT Score on CT, and absence of intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensives</z:chebi> just before recombinant tissue plasminogen activator were independently related to a 3-month modified Rankin Scale score &lt;or=1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>Congestive heart failure</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> were independently related to mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Three-month outcomes of patients receiving low-dose intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator therapy in the present study were similar to those from postmarketing surveys using 0.9 mg/kg alteplase </plain></SENT>
