<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Prior to the induction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, 16 rats were given incremental doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi> intravenously until EEG slowing with sharp wave activity became evident </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An equal number of rats (controls) received saline prior to the ischemic insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Normoxia, normocapnia, and normothermia were maintained at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, the animals were allowed to recover </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 1.5 h post-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, eight rats from each treatment group were reanesthetized, and regional brain water content was assessed gravimetrically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Brain specific gravity was significantly reduced from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values in both treatment groups, and was unaltered by pre-ischemic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi> administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Seven days post-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, the remaining animals were reanesthetized; the brains were formalin fixed and processed for identification of irreversibly injured neurons in the hippocampus, neocortex, and caudate nucleus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Saline-treated rats displayed 75 +/- 4% (mean +/- SD) dead cells in the hippocampus (CA1); <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi>-treated rats had similar injury (78 +/- 7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the neocortex and caudate nucleus, injury was graded as moderate, and no difference in severity could be distinguished between the treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The authors conclude that pre-ischemic treatment with maximal sub-epileptogenic doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi> had no effect on either early post-ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> or delayed neuronal <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> in this rat model of near-complete global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
