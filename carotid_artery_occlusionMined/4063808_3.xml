<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A comparison of survival rates after 15, 30, 45 and 60 min of occlusion revealed that 45 min was the maximum duration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> after which most (72%) of the gerbils were alive at 1 week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7983">pentobarbital</z:chebi> (single dose, 30 mg/kg) postoperatively to badly seizing animals increased survival to 100% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Large, well-demarcated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were present in posterior thalamus or midbrain in 62% of gerbils subjected to 45 min bilateral occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 60% of these animals the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were unilateral; in 40% they were bilateral </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To quantitate cell proliferation in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> from 12 h to 25 days after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, gerbils were injected with [3H]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> 4 h prior to sacrifice, and autoradiographs were prepared from sectioned brains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Proliferation took place from 2 to 7 days after occlusion, with a maximum of 24% labeled cells at 6 days </plain></SENT>
