<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most of the endovascular studies so far have been dedicated to ICA, with little focus on the ECA </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report a case of an 80-year-old male with bilateral internal and contralateral external carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> who developed limb-<z:mp ids='MP_0000745'>shaking</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> as a result of significant stenosis of the right ECA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Percutaneous revascularization of the ECA was performed by angioplasty and stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At the follow-up 12 months later, the patient remained neurologically intact with complete resolution of his symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Stenting of the ECA should be considered as a reasonable alternative to conventional open repair especially in patients with contralateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo>, insufficient circle of Willis, and significant comorbidities </plain></SENT>
