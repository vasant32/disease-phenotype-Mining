<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the efficacy of OPG-GEE screening and our nonrandomized use of carotid endarterectomy in 2312 OHS patients from 1975 to 1989 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data was analyzed using the chi 2 squared and Fisher's exact tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OPG was performed in 1602/2312 (69%) of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>OPG was positive in 122/1602 patients (7.6%) and negative in 1480/1602 (92.4%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the patients with positive OPG, 31 patients had insignificant carotid bifurcation disease, 32 patients had total internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, and 59 patients had operable carotid bifurcation lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Selective use of angiography identified an additional 8 patients with operable carotid bifurcation lesions (total 67, 33 symptomatic and 34 asymptomatic) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate for 2312 patients was 40/2312 (1.7%) [30 day mortality rate 60/2312 (3.2%)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> incidence was significantly increased (P &lt; 0.01) in patients with a positive OPG, 8/122 (6.60%) vs those with negative OPG (23/1480, 1.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, it was most marked in patients with operable bifurcation lesions (6/67, 9.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> was not increased in patients with carotid occlusion or positive OPG without significant carotid bifurcation disease (2/63, 3.20%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Carotid endarterectomy in patients with operable bifurcation lesions was associated with a decreased (P &lt; 0.05) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate after OHS (1/44, 2.30% vs 5/23, 21.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our data suggests identification of significant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0741975" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid disease</z:e> and carotid endarterectomy will decrease <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> after OHS </plain></SENT>
