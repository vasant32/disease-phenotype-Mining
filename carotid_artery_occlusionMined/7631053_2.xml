<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 64-year-old man had an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in the left parietotemporal cortical-subcortical areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>He developed a severe right spastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002357'>dysphasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An angiographic study showed left internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and right internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A right internal endoarteriectomy was performed without any clinical improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 1 year the patient was a candidate for cervical spinal cord stimulation (SCS) for the treatment of his spastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An epidural electrode (Medtronic Sigma 3483) was positioned at the cervical level, mediodorsal to the cord </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical and neurophysiological studies (surface polyelectromyography, PEMG, for evaluation of brain motor control) were performed before and after 7 days of SCS (0.2 ms, 80 c/s, intensity for paresthesiae, continuous mode) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A transcranial Doppler (TCD) study of both middle cerebral arteries (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) at rest and during SCS was performed on two occasions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>SCS was followed by improvement of voluntary movement, decrease of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001257'>spasticity</z:hpo> and better endurance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The clinical findings were confirmed by the PEMG recordings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>TCD examination showed an increase of flow velocities on both the right <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> (+43%) and the left <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> (+130%) during SCS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Such a TCD pattern, suggesting an increase of cerebral blood flow (CBF) during SCS, was reproducible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This case confirms efficacy of SCS in the treatment of ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> and the increase of CBF following cervical SCS in man </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The marked increase of CBF, particularly evident on the ischemic side, may play a role in mediating the improvement of motor control in our patient together with a possible arousal of the so-called 'sleeping neurons' of the penumbra zone </plain></SENT>
