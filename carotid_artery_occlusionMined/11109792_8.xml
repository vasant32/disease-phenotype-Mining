<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Tolerance testing of complete internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion by balloon inflation for 20 minutes was performed in nine patients (<z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysm</z:hpo> 6, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027533" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neck tumor</z:e> 3) and CEA was performed in 15 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The probe of the cerebral oximeter was placed on the forehead of the affected side and regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO2) was monitored continuously during <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Stump pressure was measured just after ICA occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Collateral circulation detected by digital subtraction angiography was classified into three groups: good, moderate, or poor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Stump pressure was 41-90 mmHg (mean 61.3 mmHg) in the good collateral circulation group, 40-43 mmHg (41.5 mmHg) in the moderate group, and 14-30 mmHg (23.8 mmHg) in the poor group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Change in rSO2 after ICA occlusion was +3.5(-)-4.2% (mean -1.6%) in the good collateral circulation group, -1.2(-)-6.6% (-3.2%) in the moderate group, and -2.4(-)-10.2% (-6.6%) in the poor group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Changes in rSO2 were significantly different between the good and poor collateral circulation groups (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A greater than 5% fall in rSO2 was observed in 0 of 15 patients in the good collateral circulation group, one of five in the moderate group, and three of four in the poor group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The cerebral oximeter is a useful, real-time, non-invasive method to measure brain oxygenation during CEA, skull base surgery, or other procedures which need to evaluate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A fall of greater than 10% from the rSO2 baseline value is dangerous, but less than 5% is safe </plain></SENT>
