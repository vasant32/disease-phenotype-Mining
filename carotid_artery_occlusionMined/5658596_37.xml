<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> was induced by bilateral carotid artery ligation and cervical vagotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Within a few minutes after blood pressure rose (30-60 mm Hg above control levels), a moderate <z:mp ids='MP_0006316'>natriuresis</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001762'>diuresis</z:mp> began </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Proximal <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> reabsorption, measured by two independent methods, was found to be markedly suppressed, both in absolute amount per unit length and per unit of tubular volume (C/pir(2)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The ratio between tubular volume and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (pir(2)d/V(0)) was found to be increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These observations indicate that the inhibition of proximal <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> reabsorption induced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> cannot be explained by the tubular geometry hypothesis of <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> regulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Several possible hormonal mechanisms were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Intravenous d-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27584,30834">aldosterone</z:chebi> did not prevent the suppression of <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> transport due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, nor did <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> oral saline loading to reduce the renal content of renin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Constriction of the suprarenal aorta, with maintenance of a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> renal perfusion pressure, did prevent the inhibition of proximal transport during carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, thus excluding an extrarenally produced natriuretic hormone as the mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The observations are compatible with the view that <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> transport was inhibited either by an intrarenal natriuretic hormone or by an increase in the interstitial volume of the kidney produced by a transient hydrostatic pressure gradient across the peritubular capillaries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The latter seems more likely to us because of the rapidity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the <z:mp ids='MP_0006316'>natriuresis</z:mp>, and because removing the renal capsule and releasing the surface interstitial fluid prevented the effect of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> on proximal <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> transport </plain></SENT>
