<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Resting flow values (ISI) varied between 23.7 and 52.4 ml/100 g/min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An almost constant finding was interhemispheric asymmetry, the degree of which was correlated with the severity of the initial symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An ischemic focus was an insignificant finding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> response was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in patients with angiographic signs of circle of Willis collateral flow and without significant contralateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo>, whereas it was impaired in patients with a retrograde ophthalmic flow or collateral flow via the circle of Willis and contralateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> greater than or equal to 50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> response in useful rCBF variable and may be applied for analysis of collateral flow capacity in patients with carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> considered for bypass surgery </plain></SENT>
