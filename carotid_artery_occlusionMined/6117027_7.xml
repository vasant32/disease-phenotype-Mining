<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>No patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> only had retrograde ophthalmic artery flow, although such a pattern was found in 50 percent of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a follow-up study (mean 48 months), the same distribution of the collateral pattern was found on ultrasonic Doppler examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The absence of substantial retrograde ophthalmic flow was associated with an increased contralateral carotid flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The findings show that the efficiency of the collateral pathways, mainly the contralateral carotid artery and the circle of Willis, largely determines the outcome of carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
