<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In vivo two-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> microscopy of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-expressing microglia in mouse neocortex was used to examine microglial dynamics during the early periods of focal and global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A penumbra-like "area-at-risk" surrounded by a square-shaped area of severely hypoperfused tissue was created by laser-induced photothrombosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The dynamics of microglial processes in the area-at-risk was strongly correlated with capillary blood flow (BF) measured within 10 μm of microglial somata </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Changes in BF around distal microglial processes (&gt;30 μm from somata) had no effect on microglial dynamics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A severe reduction of capillary BF near somata by 84% ± 6% resulted in initiation of microglial deramification, suggesting activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A moderate decrease in BF near somata by 22% ± 5% or increase by 87% ± 10%, reflecting a redistribution of capillary BF, had no effect on microglial <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Complete BF loss during <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> (CA) or transient bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (BCCAO) entirely stalled <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> microglial processes without structural changes </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, the severe drop in BF around microglial somata coincides with morphological activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, this activation requires some residual BF, because complete perfusion loss (as during BCCAO and CA) did not support microglial deramification </plain></SENT>
