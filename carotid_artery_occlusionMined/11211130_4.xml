<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Forty patients with unilateral extracranial internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> confirmed by angiography were studied, and the results were compared with those obtained in 57 age-matched patients in whom cervical duplex ultrasonography showed no abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We measured the diameter, flow velocities, and blood flow volume in both vertebral arteries, and the side-to-side differences were also calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients (27.5%) with an occluded internal carotid artery had increased peak systolic velocity in the ipsilateral vertebral artery, and 6 (15%) had increased peak systolic velocity in the contralateral vertebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean peak systolic velocity and the mean blood flow volume were statistically greater in the ipsilateral vertebral arteries than in the same-side vertebral arteries of the control group (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also detected a mean increase of 14.29% of the net blood flow volume in the vertebral arteries compared with the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with extracranial unilateral internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> may have a compensatory increase in both the peak systolic velocity and the blood flow volume in both vertebral arteries </plain></SENT>
