<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty white rabbits were divided into 6 groups, before and during 0-50 days after CAO, we studied the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and CVR of frontal lobe on the same side, using laser doppler perfusion imager (LDI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULT: The rCBF-lesion caused by CAO could hardly be observed (P &gt; 0.5), but CVR cut down obviously (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The loading test-cerebral vascular <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> reactivity (CVR) allow the hemodynamic effect of a CAO on the intracerebral circulation to be observed before the reduced rCBF can be detected </plain></SENT>
