<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Duplex ultrasonography is an accurate, noninvasive method for diagnosing, characterizing, and classifying atherosclerotic stenoses of the extracranial carotid artery system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To date, however, no large series has studied the predictive value of duplex sonography in the diagnosis of carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, an important consideration, given the marked difference in clinical treatment between patients with high-grade stenosis (surgical therapy) and those with occlusive disease (nonsurgical therapy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 158 patients with 174 occluded carotid artery segments (examined over a 6 1/2-year period) to determine the predicative value of duplex sonography in differentiating carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> from high-grade stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had arteriographic correlation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Duplex ultrasonography had a positive predictive value of 92.5% (7.5% false-positive rate; 95% confidence interval, 3.6% to 11.4%) in establishing a diagnosis of carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further analysis revealed no significant improvement in the false-positive rate with the addition of color Doppler flow imaging to high-resolution B-mode scanning and pulsed Doppler spectral analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Predictive value increased to 96.7% (95% confidence interval, 90.7% to 99.3%) over the last 2 years of the study, a statistically significant improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We believe that duplex ultrasonography is an acceptably accurate method for diagnosing carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> in most patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Arteriography should be reserved for patients with symptoms who are surgical candidates to identify those who may still have a surgically correctable high-grade stenosis </plain></SENT>
