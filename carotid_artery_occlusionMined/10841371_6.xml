<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In resting cells, NF-kappaB is sequestrated in the cytoplasm in an inactive form through its association with inhibitory proteins, I kappaB (e.g.I kappaB-alpha) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In response to cell activation, I kappaB is degraded causing release of active NF-kappaB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Active NF-kappaB translocates into the nucleus leading to activation of transcription that may have a profound effect on cell survival, including that after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here, using Western blot analysis, we show that immunoreactivity to the major subunit of NF-kappaB, p65, as well as to the inhibitory subunit I kappaB-alpha is equally markedly decreased in the ischemic core after transient middle cerebral and common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, penumbral regions display no change in p65, and significant increase in I kappaB-alpha immunoreactivity, as compared to non-ischemic areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In these penumbral regions with elevated I kappaB-alpha immunoreactivity, we find reduced cytosolic and increased nuclear I kappaB-alpha staining of neurons, as determined by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Altogether, these results suggest that an altered ratio between activating and inhibitory NF-kappaB pathways mediated through I kappaB-alpha may play an important role in survival of the ischemic penumbra </plain></SENT>
