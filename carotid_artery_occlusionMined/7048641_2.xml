<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of 9 patients showing symmetrical filling of hemispheric cortical arteries, none showed an inter-hemispheric difference in rCBF ( delta Fg) greater than 10ml/100gm/min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of 9 patients showing delayed cortical opacification ipsilateral to the internal <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, 3 showed a delta Fg greater than 10ml/100gm/min, 3 showed a delta Fg in the 7-10ml/100gm/min range, and 3 had a delta Fg less than 7ml/100gm/min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with asymmetric abnormalities in the rCBF profile had the delayed pattern of cortical filling on DSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The presence of symmetrical hemispheric opacification of cortical arteries on DSA indicates adequate interhemispheric redistribution of rCBF and patent inter-hemispheric collateral channels, but not necessarily <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cerebral blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The presence of delayed cortical arterial opacification on the side of internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> does not necessarily imply significant inter-hemispheric rCBF differences, nor does it rule out a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rCBF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The presence of bilateral reduction of rCBF and symmetrical cortical artery filling on DSA may represent an "interhemispheric steal" </plain></SENT>
