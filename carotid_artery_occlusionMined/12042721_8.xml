<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is associated with a risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> during carotid clamping, particularly in the face of contralateral internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the results of CEA with continuous electroencephalography in patients without and with contralateral ICA occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND SETTING: We reviewed 564 primary CEAs with routine electroencephalography and general anesthesia performed between April 1, 1989, and March 31, 1999, in a community teaching medical center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Main outcome measures were perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, temporary lateralizing neurologic deficit, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Shunts were placed primarily for significant electroencephalographic changes after carotid clamping but also selectively for contralateral ICA occlusion, prior <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, or surgeon choice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CEA was performed for asymptomatic disease in 35% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Significant electroencephalographic changes occurred in 16% versus 39% (P &lt;.001) and shunts were placed in 13% versus 55% (P &lt;.001) of patients with patent (n = 507) versus occluded contralateral ICA (n = 57), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The fraction of CEAs with significant electroencephalographic changes during clamping was stable, but shunt use declined slightly over time as our confidence in electroencephalography increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patches were placed more often (86% versus 65%; P =.002), but other operative details were similar when the contralateral ICA was occluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Five early (30 days) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> (0.9%) and eight early temporary postoperative neurologic events (1.4%) occurred, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ipsilateral to CEA and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> after the patient left the operating room with none in patients with contralateral ICA occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occurred, one in a patient without and one in a patient with contralateral ICA occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Neither of these <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> was related to ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No increase in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate with decreased shunt use over time was seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Routine use of electroencephalography was associated with apparent complete elimination of intraoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> and less than 1% risk of perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These observations appear to be true even in the face of contralateral ICA occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Electroencephalography is a sensitive detector of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and a valuable tool for determination of need for shunting during CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Surgeons should consider routine use of electroencephalography and selective shunting for significant electroencephalographic changes with clamping </plain></SENT>
