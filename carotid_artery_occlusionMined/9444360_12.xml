<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Severe hypoxic-ischemic cerebral damage was produced in 8-day-old rats following permanent bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and 15 min of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cellular damage consisted of early <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> and appearance of cells with apoptotic-like <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> (karyorrhectic cells) and cells with granular chromatin degeneration in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, stratum and amygdala </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Expression of Bcl-2, Bax and Bcl-x was examined in control and hypoxic-ischemic rats using immunohistochemistry and Western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Members of the Bcl-2 family were expressed in the vast majority of, if not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, neurons in control pups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Bcl-2, Bax and Bcl-x immunoreactivity decreased in necrotic cells, but about 60% of cells with apoptotic-like <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and cells with granular chromatin degeneration were stained with antibodies to Bcl-2, Bax or Bcl-x </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although the total number of stained cells decreased with time, recruitment of cells with apoptotic <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and cells with granular chromatin degeneration was still found up to 48 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Western blots showed a band at about p28 and p21, respectively for Bcl-2 and Bax in control and hypoxic-ischemic pups at 6, 12 and 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two bands at about p37 and p30, representing Bcl-xL and Bcl-xS, respectively, were found in samples stained with antibodies to Bcl-x </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No gross changes in the intensity of these bands were observed in ischemic pups at 6, 12 and 24 h, except for a slight decrease in Bcl-2 at 24 h, and a slight and inconstant increase of the putative Bcl-xS at 12 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that Bcl-2, Bax, Bcl-xL and Bcl-xS do not play a leading role in the fate of damaged nerve cells following a severe hypoxic-ischemic insult of the developing brain </plain></SENT>
