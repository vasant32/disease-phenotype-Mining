<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, the effects of 6-(10-hydroxydecyl)-2, 3-dimethoxy-5-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-1, 4-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16509,39439">benzoquinone</z:chebi> (idebenone, CV-2619) on neurological signs, local cerebral blood flow, and cerebral energy metabolism were assessed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP) with bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (BCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment with CV-2619 (10-100 mg/kg, p.o.) for three or ten successive days delayed the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>) and prolonged survival time in the SHRSP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When the compound (100 mg/kg, i.p.) was given once 30 min after BCAO, it exerted similar ameliorating effects on the neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When CV-2619 (100 mg/kg for 3 days) was given orally, it did not inhibit a decrease in regional cerebral blood flow induced by the carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the same treatment markedly inhibited increases in <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> content and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> ratio and a decrease in ATP content in the cerebral cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, the compound showed no effect on cerebral blood flow in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that CV-2619 has an ameliorating effect on neurological deficits related with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, and this effect is mediated by improved cerebral energy metabolism </plain></SENT>
