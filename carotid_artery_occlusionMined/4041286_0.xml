<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among these, thirteen cases, which had the history of cerebral ischemic attack during childhood, are classified as the cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003621'>juvenile onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The other thirty-eight cases were classified as those of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003581'>adult onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In most of the cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003621'>juvenile onset</z:hpo>, occlusive lesions also affected cortical arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For these cases, it is important to perform STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> double anastomoses and encephalo-myo-synangiosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Those of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003581'>adult onset</z:hpo> resembled the pathophysiology of internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, or that of middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, since few cortical <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was noted, and leptomeningeal anastomosis was well developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis was considered to be the treatment of choice in those of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003581'>adult onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
