<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>LY379268 (10 mg/kg i.p.) 30 or 60 min after 5-min bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (BCAO) attenuated the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000752'>hyperactivity</z:hpo> and provided protection in the CA1 hippocampal cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This neuroprotective effect was maintained (P &lt;.001) when histological analysis was performed 14 and 28 days after BCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, 24- or 48-h pretreatment with LY379268, 10 mg/kg i.p., before 5-min BCAO markedly reduced (P &lt;.001 and P &lt;.05, respectively) the damage to CA1 hippocampal neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This result is consistent with the induction of neuroprotective factors or a very long brain half-life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To study the possible induction of neuroprotective factors as contributing to this action of LY379268, brains were examined for expression of neurotrophic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results indicated that LY379268 (10 mg/kg i.p.) failed to alter the expression of transforming growth factor-beta, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, nerve growth factor, and basic fibroblast growth factor in the hippocampal regions of brains taken from gerbils sacrificed at 6, 24, 72, and 120 h postinjection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The new group II mGlu <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, LY341495, administered 1 h before 5-min BCAO, attenuated the neuroprotective effect of LY379268 administered 24 h before 5-min BCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Complementary pharmacokinetic studies showed that a significant receptor-active concentration persisted in the brain 24 h after LY379268 10 mg/kg i.p </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that group II mGluR occupancy, rather than induction of neuroprotective factors, explains the long-lasting neuroprotective effect of LY379268 in the gerbil model of global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
