<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The extracranial, internal carotid artery balloon test occlusion is helpful in predicting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> resulting from operative occlusion of the internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, balloon test occlusion is falsely negative in up to 20% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With selected use of the paraophthalmic internal carotid artery balloon test occlusion, our group has identified a patient subset that developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> resulting from supraclinoid internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, in spite of passing the standard balloon test occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patient charts were reviewed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> balloon test occlusion referrals over a two-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic angiography and standard cervical internal carotid artery balloon test occlusion were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The presence of retrograde ophthalmic blood flow was determined by angiography during cervical balloon test occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Balloon test occlusion was then performed in those patients who both demonstrated retrograde ophthalmic blood flow during the cervical balloon test occlusion and those who were considered candidates for planned supraclinoid internal carotid artery sacrifice during skull base surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ten patients were referred for carotid balloon test occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One patient who refused balloon test occlusion was excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two patients (2/9 or 22%) failed the initial balloon test occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two of the seven remaining patients (and one who failed balloon test occlusion) demonstrated retrograde ophthalmic arterial flow during cervical balloon test occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Of the patients who passed the initial balloon test occlusion, one failed paraophthalmic carotid artery balloon test occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Surgical planning in one patient (1/7 or 14%) was significantly modified because of the results of the paraophthalmic carotid artery balloon test occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Paraophthalmic internal carotid artery balloon test occlusion is indicated when planning supraclinoid internal carotid artery sacrifice in patients who demonstrate retrograde ophthalmic arterial flow during uneventful cervical carotid balloon test occlusion </plain></SENT>
