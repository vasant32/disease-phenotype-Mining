<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Methods to assess the degree of its oxygenation have generally been invasive and indirect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rapid assessment of brain oxygenation is particularly vital during cerebrospinal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have developed a noninvasive electro-optical method using pulsed near-infrared (NIR) light to quantify brain oxygenation during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> in anesthetized rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>Cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was induced through 30-40Â s of bi-lateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> was induced by varying inspired oxygen levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The NIR light response to the interventions was expressed in terms of relative absorption (RA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results showed that our pulsed NIR system could rapidly detect sudden alterations in oxygenation and blood flow to the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The response patterns during <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> were significantly different, although both decreased brain oxygenation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The overall RA response to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was much faster (in seconds) than during <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> (in minutes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These different response patterns can serve as early warning signal of low brain oxygenation and to discriminate the cause of the diminished oxygenation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The present pulsed NIR system is capable to provide a rapid, noninvasive and continuous monitoring of such decreases in brain oxygenation </plain></SENT>
