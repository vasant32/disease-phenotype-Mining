<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Carotid stent <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> is a rare complication of this procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE DESCRIPTIONS: We present 2 case reports from a university medical center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two patients had angiographically confirmed carotid stent (CS) <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> with subsequent fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The first was a 63-year-old woman who developed stent <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> after the procedure was performed for a postendarterectomy intimal flap </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The second patient was a 57-year-old man who underwent CS placement for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> and developed internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> at the level of the stent 3 days later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neither patient was treated with combination antiplatelet therapy before or after CS placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both patients died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CS <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> can be a cause of fatal iatrogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Combination antiplatelet therapy should be administered to decrease the incidence of this complication </plain></SENT>
