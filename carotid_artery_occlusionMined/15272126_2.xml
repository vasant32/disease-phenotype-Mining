<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The multimodal magnetic resonance imaging study in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> includes perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI) after administration of contrast and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, MRA may overestimate the degree of vessel obstruction caused by limitations to detect low flow states </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to determine the usefulness of a new fast imaging protocol combining classical MRA, PWI, and postperfusion MRA to improve the diagnostic management in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 31 patients with a middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) infarction within the first 12 hours from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had an <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis or occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The study protocol included a preperfusion MRA and a postperfusion MRA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Modified thrombolysis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (TIMI) classification was used to assess the patency of vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 17 patients (group A, 55%), preperfusion MRA and postperfusion MRA accorded in the estimation of vascular status, whereas in 14 patients (group B, 45%) postperfusion MRA showed a better vascular flow than preperfusion MRA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The improvement in the depiction of flow was from a complete occlusion (TIMI I) to a partial occlusion (TIMI II) in 9 patients and from TIMI II to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> patency (TIMI III) in 5 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thirty-six percent of the patients with suspected internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in the preperfusion MRA showed flow in the intracranial internal carotid artery in the postperfusion MRA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Postperfusion contrast-enhanced MRA can demonstrate arterial segments with low flow and avoid overestimation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">vascular obstruction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
