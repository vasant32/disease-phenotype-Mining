<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The calves were chronically instrumented to measure (or derive) heart rate, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> volume, cardiac output, iliac, superior mesenteric and renal flows and resistances, mean carotid, aortic, right atrial, pulmonary artery, and left atrial pressures, the systemic and pulmonary pressure gradients, and total systemic and total pulmonary resistances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The calves were also instrumented to produce reversible partial constriction of the ascending aorta and common carotid arteries and for cooling of the cervical vagus nerves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The hemodynamic responses to increased afterload were characterized during treadmill exercise at 2 mph </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These responses were compared to the hemodynamic responses to bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> with and without vagal cooling </plain></SENT>
