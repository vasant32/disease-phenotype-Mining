<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively reviewed our institutional experience with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> carotid occlusions using internal carotid artery endovascular thrombolysis and stent placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied the radiographic and clinical characteristics of 17 patients with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cervical internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> treated with stent-assisted endovascular thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical outcomes were assessed by using National Institute of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) scores, which were obtained on admission and discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Inclusion criteria were an NIHSS score of at least 6 and the presence of significant penumbra on computed tomographic perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Morbidity and mortality data were collected and analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventeen candidates met our inclusion criteria, 16 (94%) of whom had successful immediate recanalization of the internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On admission, the mean NIHSS score was 16.5 and the mean modified Rankin Scale score was 4.8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean NIHSS score improved to 6.9 on discharge, with a mean modified Rankin Scale score of 2.88 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Eight (47%) patients recovered ambulatory function on discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The overall mortality rate of our series was 17% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In the setting of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, emergent carotid artery thrombolysis and stenting is a promising treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> carotid occlusions with excellent recanalization rates and favorable clinical outcomes </plain></SENT>
