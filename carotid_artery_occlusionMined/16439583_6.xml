<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rebound brain intracellular <z:hpo ids='HP_0001948'>alkalosis</z:hpo> has been observed in experimental models and adult <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> after <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (HI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In term infants with neonatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> (NE), an association exists between the magnitude of brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0001948'>alkalosis</z:hpo> and neurodevelopmental outcome, and there is increasing evidence to suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001948'>alkalosis</z:hpo> may be deleterious to cell survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Activation of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15378">H(+)</z:chebi> exchanger (NHE) is thought to be responsible for the rapid normalization of pH(i) and rebound <z:hpo ids='HP_0001948'>alkalosis</z:hpo> after reperfusion </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seven-day-old mice underwent left carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> followed by exposure to 8% oxygen for 30 min (moderate insult) or 1 h (severe insult) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Animals received MIA or saline 8 hourly starting 30 min before HI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Outcome was determined at 48 h by measuring viable tissue in the injured hemisphere (severe insult) or injury score and TUNEL staining (moderate insult) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After the severe insult, MIA had a significant neuroprotective effect increasing forebrain tissue survival from 44% to 67% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After the moderate insult, damage was localized to the hippocampus where treatment resulted in a significant reduction in injury score and in TUNEL-positive cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>MIA was also shown to have a significant overall neuroprotective effect based on injury score after the moderate insult </plain></SENT>
