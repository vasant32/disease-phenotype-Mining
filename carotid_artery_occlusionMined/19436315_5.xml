<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report a new clinically relevant model of neonatal hypoxic-ischemic injury in a 10-day-old rat pup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and 8% <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> (1 to 15 mins, BCAO-H) was induced with varying degrees of injury (mild, moderate, severe), which was quantified using magnetic resonance imaging including diffusion-weighted and T2-weighted imaging at 24 h and 21/28 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We developed a magnetic resonance imaging-based rat pup severity score and compared 3D ischemic injury volumes/rat pup severity score with histology and behavioral testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At 24 h, hypoxic-ischemic injury was observed in 17/27 animals; long-term survival was 81% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging lesion volumes did not correlate with <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> duration but correlated with rat pup severity score, which was used to classify animals into mild (n=21), moderate (n=6), and severe (n=10) groups with average brain lesion volumes of 0.9%, 33.2%, and 56.3%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Histology confirmed lesion location and histologic scoring correlated with the rat pup severity score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also found excellent correlation between injury severity and multiple behavioral tasks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> in the P10 rat pup is an excellent model of neonatal hypoxic-ischemic injury because it induces diffuse global injury similar to the term infant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This model can produce graded injury severity, similar to that seen in human neonates, but manipulation with <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> duration is unpredictable </plain></SENT>
