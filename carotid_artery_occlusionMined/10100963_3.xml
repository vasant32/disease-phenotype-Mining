<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to use transcranial Doppler ultrasonography to investigate cerebrovascular reactivity to <z:mp ids='MP_0002318'>hypercapnia</z:mp> in the middle cerebral arteries of patients with carotid occlusion with different outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cerebrovascular reactivity to <z:mp ids='MP_0002318'>hypercapnia</z:mp> was calculated with the breath-holding index (BHI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with unilateral carotid occlusion were divided as follows: asymptomatic (20 patients), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>) (20 patients), minor (20 patients) and major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (14 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Values of BHI homolateral to the carotid occlusion were compared with those of 25 healthy subjects and 34 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients without significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: BHI values were comparable in healthy controls, non stenotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients and asymptomatic occluded patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>BHI values of patients with symptomatic occlusion were significantly lower than those of the above-mentioned groups (P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the reduction of BHI was significantly associated with the extent of the neurological impairment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In fact, BHI values were significantly higher in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> than in minor and major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (P&lt;0.0001) and in minor than in major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients (P&lt;0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, we found that a BHI value homolateral to carotid occlusion of 0.69 can be considered the cut-point for distinguishing between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Prospective studies are needed to demonstrate if the presence of this threshold value may help in selecting a subset of patients with asymptomatic carotid occlusion or with transient or mild neurological deficit with the highest probability of benefiting from surgical therapy </plain></SENT>
