<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Renal and cerebral blood flow were measured with a hydrogen clearance technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Either phenoxybenzamine (0.5 mg/kg body wt) or <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8499">propranolol</z:chebi> (2 mg/kg) was given i.v. immediately after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was induced to examine the drugs' effects on cerebral and renal hemodynamics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One hour after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia, cerebral</z:e> blood flow was markedly reduced to 5, 3, and almost 0% of the preischemic value in the untreated, phenoxybenzamine-treated, and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8499">propranolol</z:chebi>-treated rats, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, renal blood flow at that time was decreased to 65, 88, and 67%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The calculated renal vascular resistance was similarly increased to 151% in the untreated and 136% in the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8499">propranolol</z:chebi>-treated rats, but decreased to 82% in the phenoxybenzamine-treated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The present results indicate that in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> renal blood flow was considerably decreased with concomitant <z:mp ids='MP_0005531'>increased renal vascular resistance</z:mp>, and that such reduction in renal blood flow was minimized by alpha-adrenergic blockade but not by beta-blockade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that activation of the alpha-adrenergic system in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> causes renal vasoconstriction </plain></SENT>
