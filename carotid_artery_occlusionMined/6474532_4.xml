<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In order to evaluate cerebral blood flow (CBF) patterns among individual patients with increased statistical confidence, CBF measurements were carried out using the 133Xe-inhalation method and external head detectors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>F1 values representing gray matter flow from 3 to 6 head detectors were averaged to form 16 different regions for each cerebral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Normative values were obtained from 46 healthy volunteers, and data from individual regions were analyzed for absolute blood flow rates (ml/100g/min), for concordance between right and left hemispheres and as percent of mean hemispheric flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CBF measurements were then carried out among 37 patients with cerebrovascular occlusive diseases, and results were compared with normative values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A high incidence of abnormal flows were detected among symptomatic patients with intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0100545'>arterial stenosis</z:hpo> or occlusion and those with extracranial internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By using the above method for data analysis, it was possible to delineate hypoperfused areas among these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Even though the 133Xe-inhalation method has inherent limitations, this is a practical and safe method for measurement of CBF which can provide reliable information useful for management of patients with cerebrovascular occlusive diseases, particularly when the results are presented with statistical confidence </plain></SENT>
