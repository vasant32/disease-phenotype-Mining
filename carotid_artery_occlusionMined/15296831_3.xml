<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> will induce apoptotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> selectively to hippocampal cornus ammon's field 1 of the hippocampus (CA1) pyramidal cells, while neighboring CA3 and dentate neurons are spared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Poly MVA is a <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50733">dietary supplement</z:chebi> based on the nontoxic chemotherapeutic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30314">lipoic acid</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="79" ids="33363">palladium</z:chebi> complex (LAPd) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>LAPd is a liquid crystal that works in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells by transferring excess electrons from membrane fatty acids to DNA via the mitochondria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, by its structural nature and action as a redox shuttle, it can both quench radicals as well as provide energy to the mitochondria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To understand the role of LAPd in regulating ischemic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, we studied Poly MVA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Male Mongolian gerbils were subjected to 5 min of bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> under a controlled temperature environment (37.0-38.0 degrees C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Animals were injected with physiological saline or either 30, 50, or 70 mg/kg of Poly MVA every 24 h beginning immediately after the occlusion until being sacrificed on experimental day 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Damage was evaluated by analyzing nesting behavior and conducting blinded measures of viable CA1 lengths </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> Poly MVA treatment dosages significantly (p &lt; 0.05) reduced hippocampal CA1 damage by 72 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Nesting scores were significantly improved after 30 and 50 mg/kg treatment but not 70 mg/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>While nesting is usually a very accurate indicator of morphological damage, the 70 mg/kg-treated animals demonstrated excessive energy, thus ignoring the nesting material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>While numerous routes offer varying degrees of CA1 neuronal survival after transient global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, only the LAPd complex, which quenches radicals and provides energy to stabilize the mitochondria, offers such significant protection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Thus, the administration of Poly MVA may be a potent neuroprotective agent for victims of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo>, <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anesthetic</z:chebi> accidents, or drowning </plain></SENT>
