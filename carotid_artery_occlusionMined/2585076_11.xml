<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Direct surgery on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> in the cavernous sinus is a formidable technical procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The intimate relationship of the intracavernous carotid artery to the venous structures and to the cranial nerves make surgical access difficult at best </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-two of 356 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> patients presented with symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> originating from the intracavernous internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> contained entirely within the cavernous sinus, and in 11 others the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> arose within the cavernous sinus and extended into the subarachnoid space </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the purely intracavernous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> there were five small <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> (less than 25 mm) and 16 giant (greater than or equal to 25 mm) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients with purely intracavernous lesions had a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271347" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">superior orbital fissure syndrome</z:e>, and six had a variety of other symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of 11 patients with subarachnoid extension, five had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (Grade I or II), five had ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo>, and one had periorbital pain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were treated as follows: Group 1 received progressive ligation of the internal carotid artery in the neck with a Selverstone clamp and a surface superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery (STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) anastomosis (purely intracavernous in nine, and with subarachnoid extension in one); Group 2 underwent trapping of the internal carotid artery and a deep STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis (purely intracavernous in seven); and Group 3 had direct clipping of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> (purely intracavernous in five, and with subarachnoid extension in 10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The cavernous sinus was entered directly through its roof by a pterional craniotomy with radical removal of the optic canal, lesser sphenoid wing, and lateral and superior orbital walls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Proximal control of the internal carotid artery was obtained through a cervical incision </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two patients in Group 1 developed transient neurological deficits, which resolved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Two patients in Group 2 developed a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, one of whom died; in both of these patients, the anastomosis was completed after the internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Two patients in Group 3 progressed from marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000618'>blindness</z:hpo> of the same side, and one developed an <z:mp ids='MP_0001917'>intraventricular hemorrhage</z:mp> during induction of anesthesia and died without surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It is proposed that a direct approach to symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> in the cavernous sinus is the best initial alternative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>When this approach is not feasible, a trapping procedure preceded by a high-flow extracranial-intracranial anastomosis may be considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Although the authors have been able to clip <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of various sizes, this has not been possible in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Further work is needed in this area </plain></SENT>
