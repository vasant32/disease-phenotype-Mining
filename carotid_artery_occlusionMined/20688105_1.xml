<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We therefore investigated, if disconnecting the cerebral circulation from vertebral collateral blood flow by proximal occlusion of the basilar artery together with temporary bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (BCCAo) may be a more feasible approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>C57/Bl6 mice were anesthetized and the basilar artery was occluded through a ventral approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ten days later BCCAo was performed for 8-14min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Increasing durations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> resulted in enhanced neuronal cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in cortex, striatum, and hippocampus (22-63%) and increased neurological dysfunction and mortality (0-36%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Following 10min of BCCAo, the duration of global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> with the most favorable mortality/neuronal cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> ratio, hippocampal damage started 6h after the insult while cortical and striatal damage was delayed by at least 24h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No further loss of neuronal cells was observed later than 3 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The proposed two-step approach resulted in complete <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and caused neuronal damage with high reproducibility and small variability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In combination with transgenic and knock-out mice this technically feasible model may help to extend our knowledge on the pathophysiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo>-induced brain damage </plain></SENT>
