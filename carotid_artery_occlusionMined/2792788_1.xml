<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> was produced by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi> treatment in 2-day neonates and the experiment was performed at the age of 5 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The level of mean arterial pressure was not different between diabetic and nondiabetic rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At 1 h after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia, cerebral</z:e> blood flow was decreased to 1% of the resting value and supratentorial <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> was increased by 8-fold of control, being virtually the same in both groups of rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, reduction of cerebral ATP was much less in diabetic rats (1.64 +/- 0.15 mmol/kg) than in nondiabetic rats (0.74 +/- 0.07 mmol/kg) (p less than 0.001); ATP in nonischemic control is 2.80-2.85 mmol/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results could not be explained by the difference in cerebral blood flow between the groups during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Effective utilization of metabolites, such as <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17087">ketone</z:chebi> bodies, may play an important role to minimize metabolic derangements in the ischemic brain in type 2 diabetic-hyperglycemic rats </plain></SENT>
