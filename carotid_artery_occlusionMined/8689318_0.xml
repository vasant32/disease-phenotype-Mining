<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is probably the consequence of both improved diagnostics and surgical technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MAIN PURPOSE AND STARTING POINTS (OBJECTIVES) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because of a relatively high incidence of this group of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> the authors of this paper analyzed their own patients population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From 1st Jan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>1987 to 31st Dec </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>1994 10 patients were admitted 10 patients with altogether 11 supraaortic trunk <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Last year 5 patients with 5 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> (45 percent) were admitted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean age of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients was 57.5 (20-88) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean age in the group of carotid artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> was 75.2 (71-88) years, and 31 (20-43) years in the group of subclavian artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Both carotid and subclavian arteries <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were managed by the same technique--<z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> resection and graft interposition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were two exceptions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>One of them was a young woman with a small asymptomatic subclavian artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> in connection with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039984" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thoracic outlet syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> has been left in its place and followed up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The second exception was a young man with a posttraumatic false <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the intrathoracic part of the right subclavian artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>He died without surgery because of massive haemorrhage due to the a false <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> rupture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>MAIN RESULTS: The hospital mortality of the group of operated patient was zero </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>There has been one head nerve injury in this group and 100 percent immediate patency, as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients have been followed up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>There have been found an asymptomatic internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, the rest of reconstructions has been functioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of the extracranial supraaortic arteries are rare vascular lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>They have, however, a high incidence of unfavorable sequelae, most of them of neurologic nature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The authors emphasize the importance of proper diagnosis and early surgical intervention in selected cases put into the hands of an experienced vascular surgeon </plain></SENT>
