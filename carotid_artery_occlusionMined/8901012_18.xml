<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have examined the effects of these agents on two defined subtypes of voltage-dependent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> channels and in the gerbil model of global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recombinantly expressed human alpha 1B-1 alpha 2b beta 1-3 Ca2+ subunits in HEK293 cells, which results in an omega-conotoxin-sensitive neuronal N-type voltage-dependent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> channel and omega-Aga <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IVA</z:e> sensitive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> channels (P-type) in acutely isolated cerebellar Purkinje neurones were reversibly inhibited by ifenprodil and eliprodil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Human N-type <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> channel currents were inhibited by ifenprodil and eliprodil with IC50 values of 50 microM and 10 microM respectively whereas P-type <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> channel currents were inhibited reversibly by ifenprodil and eliprodil with approximate IC50 values of 60 microM and 9 microM respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Maximum current block observed for both channel subtypes was approximately 80% for both ifenprodil and eliprodil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For neuroprotection studies, animals were subjected to 5 min bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> with or without administration of either ifenprodil or eliprodil (5, 10 or 20 mg/kg i.p.) immediately after surgery followed by two further doses (2.5, 5 or 10 mg/kg, respectively) at 3 and 6 h post-occlusion </plain></SENT>
