<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Autologous blood transfusion (<z:chebi fb="5" ids="53329">ABT</z:chebi>), for example, by means of cell saver equipment, is used to reduce the need for allogenic blood transfusion in patients with high perioperative blood loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study investigated the effect of blood/extracorporal surface interaction during withdrawal and retransfusion of shed autologous blood on cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rats subjected to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> served as positive controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eighty-eight male Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9130">sevoflurane</z:chebi>, instrumented, and randomly assigned to the following groups: sham-operation (SHAM), autologous blood withdrawal/transfusion only (<z:chebi fb="5" ids="53329">ABT</z:chebi>), or bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and autologous blood withdrawal/transfusion (BCAO/<z:chebi fb="5" ids="53329">ABT</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Inflammatory gene expression was investigated with real-time RT-polymerase chain reaction at 6, 12, and 24 hours after SHAM, <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53329">ABT</z:chebi>, or BCAO/<z:chebi fb="5" ids="53329">ABT</z:chebi> in brain hippocampal tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Naive rats were investigated as reference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53329">ABT</z:chebi> alone had no impact on hippocampal inflammatory gene expression, whereas after BCAO/<z:chebi fb="5" ids="53329">ABT</z:chebi> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha (10.7 fold at 24 h), interleukin-1Î² (2.1 fold at 6 h), interleukin-6 (35.7 fold at 24 h), COX-2 (9.3 fold at 6 h), and inducible nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (3.4 fold at 24 h) increased compared with SHAM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53329">ABT</z:chebi> by itself did not provoke an inflammatory reaction in the healthy brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, in combination with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> the induction of a broad spectrum of inflammatory parameters indicates an inflammatory reaction of the hippocampus beginning after 6 hours and being most pronounced after 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, this study shows that cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> is not induced by <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53329">ABT</z:chebi> after contact with extracorporal surfaces in rats </plain></SENT>
