<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In order to examine clinical potential for ecarazine, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="8364">prazosin</z:chebi>, phentolamine and hexamethonium to cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0001278'>orthostatic hypotension</z:hpo> in man, the effects of these drugs on the vasopressor reflexes induced by bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (BCO) or head-up tilting (Tilt) have been investigated in gallamine-immobilized cats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ecarazine at doses of 0.1 to 10 mg/kg i.v. decreased blood pressure in a dose-dependent way whereas at 0.1 to 1 mg/kg it did not affect the pressor response to BCO or Tilt and at 10 mg/kg it suppressed only the response to BCO slightly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="8364">prazosin</z:chebi>, phentolamine and hexamethonium, at hypotensive doses, not only decreased blood pressure but also inhibited pressor responses to both BCO and Tilt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because ecarazine lacks in producing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001278'>orthostatic hypotension</z:hpo>, it seems likely that the clinical propensity of drugs to cause such side effect is correlated with the inhibition of Tilt response rather than with that to BCO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results of comparison of the inhibition by these drugs of Tilt response indicate that ecarazine is the most favorable drug among these four drugs and that phentolamine has the highest incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001278'>orthostatic hypotension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With respect to the effects of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="8364">prazosin</z:chebi>, phentolamine and hexamethonium, statistically significant correlation between the inhibition of the response to BCO and that to the compensatory reflex to Tilt has been observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hence it is suggested that the agents which decrease blood pressure by affecting peripheral sympathetic mechanisms might depress each efferent sympathetic pathway to the same degree </plain></SENT>
