<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Postoperative patency of the bypass can be shown by means of Seldinger angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By this method no information however is obtained on the hemodynamic function of the bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OPG-Gee measures the Ophthalmic Artery Pressure (OAP) which is related to the ICPP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study OPG-Gee is performed without and subsequently with compression of the bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Quantification of the hemodynamic significance of the bypass is obtained by measuring the pressure decay in the ophthalmic arteries during this procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Rest Pressure Difference (RPD), i.e. the pressure difference between the two ophthalmic arteries without bypass compression is measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By subtracting the RPD from the BCD the remaining pressure is called the Net Bypass Pressure (NBP), i.e. the pressure difference, which the EC/IC bypass contributes to the ICPP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>If, however, at constant systemic arterial blood pressure (SABP) the OAP drops during bypass compression on both sides, we hypothesize that the NBP is the sum of both drops, because, as a result of the interhemispheric steal mechanism, the less perfused hemisphere steals from the better perfused hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In a group of 40 patients OPG-Gee without and subsequently with bypass compression was applied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Twenty two of 40 OPG-Gee's showed NBP's of 4 mm of mercury or more (55%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the group of 29 patients with unilateral internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in 21 patients (72%) an NBP of 4 mm of mercury or more was found (mean of 13 mm of mercury).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
