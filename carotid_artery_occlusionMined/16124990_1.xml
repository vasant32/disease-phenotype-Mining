<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In this study, a new approach based on adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) was presented for detection of internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> and occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The internal carotid arterial Doppler signals were recorded from 130 subjects that 45 of them suffered from internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp>, 44 of them suffered from internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and the rest of them were healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The three ANFIS classifiers were used to detect internal carotid artery conditions (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, stenosis and occlusion) when two features, resistivity and pulsatility indices, defining changes of internal carotid arterial Doppler waveforms were used as inputs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To improve diagnostic accuracy, the fourth ANFIS classifier (combining ANFIS) was trained using the outputs of the three ANFIS classifiers as input data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The proposed ANFIS model combined the neural network adaptive capabilities and the fuzzy logic qualitative approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Some conclusions concerning the impacts of features on the detection of internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> and occlusion were obtained through analysis of the ANFIS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The performance of the ANFIS model was evaluated in terms of classification accuracies and the results confirmed that the proposed ANFIS classifiers have some potential in detecting the internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> and occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The ANFIS model achieved accuracy rates which were higher than that of the stand-alone neural network model </plain></SENT>
