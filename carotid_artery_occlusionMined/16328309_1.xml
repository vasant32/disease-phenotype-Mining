<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These groups were compared with a group of sham-operated adult rats (controls, 4) to rule out a drift of the parameters over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The animals were examined in a 2.35 T scanner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>, T2, and T2* were measured in both hemispheres of rat parietotemporal cerebral cortex, thalamic nuclei, and hippocampus 1 day before as well as on days 1, 3, 7, and 14 after sham operation and in different models of oligemia, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>Hypotension</z:hpo> alone had no significant effect on MRI parameters in rat brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After BCCAO, an increase in T2* was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>If a permanent BCCAO was combined with transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo>, however, 84% of 1-year-old animals died within 14 days after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the surviving animals, significant changes in <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>, T2, and T2* were observed in the hippocampus and parietotemporal cerebral cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> showed a decrease on day 1 after oligemia, and an increase on days 3, 7, and 14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The T2* and T2 values were markedly increased on days 7 and 14 after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, only severe oligemia combining BCCAO and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> induces significant changes in tissue integrity (as shown by <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>) and in blood oxygenation levels in the subchronic period, whereas no significant changes were detected if permanent BCCAO or transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> was applied separately </plain></SENT>
