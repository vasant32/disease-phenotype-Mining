<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it remains unclear whether and to what extent the beneficial effects of cell cycle inhibition might also be attributed to the inhibition of microglial proliferation and cytokine/chemokine production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we showed that application of the cell cycle inhibitor roscovitine before middle carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in the rat inhibited microglial proliferation and cytokine/chemokine production, and reduced the number of cell-cycle-related proteins including cyclin A, cyclin B, and cyclin E </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of these microglia-related changes may contribute to roscovitine's effect on reducing neuronal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume, thus improving neurological scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using the BV-2 microglia cell line, we showed that roscovitine not only inhibited oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation (OGD) induced cell cycle activation by arresting the cells at G1/S and G2/M in a dose-dependent manner, but it also inhibited interleukin-1 beta (IL-1beta), macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha (MIP-1alpha), and nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that cell cycle modulation results in neuroprotection in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, mediated at least in part through inhibition of microglia proliferation and production of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1beta, MIP-1alpha, and NO </plain></SENT>
