<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to review one center's experience concerning CEA opposite an occluded ICA, to see whether results differed from those obtained in patients with patent contralateral ICA in terms of relevant neurologic complication rate (RNCR, fatal + disabling <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-free rate, and survival rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>From January 1997 to December 2002, 1,381 patients underwent a total of 1,445 CEAs at the Department of Vascular Surgery of Padua University </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into two groups: group A included 144 patients with occlusion of the contralateral ICA and group B consisted of 1,237 patients with a patent contralateral ICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no postoperative mortality in patients of group A, while in group B, two patients died as a result of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>cardiac failure</z:hpo> and one died as a direct result of perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Postoperative disabling <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> occurred in one (0.7%) patient in group A and 10 (0.8%) patients in group B (p &gt; 0.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At 72 months, there were no statistical differences between the two groups in terms of RNCR, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-free rate, and late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results show that contralateral carotid occlusion does not reduce the safety of CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The efficacy in terms of RNCR, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-free rate, and late survival is no different in patients with contralateral carotid occlusion </plain></SENT>
