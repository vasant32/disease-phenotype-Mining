<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: p53-upregulated modulator of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> (PUMA), a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30153">BH3</z:chebi>-only member of the Bcl-2 protein family, is required for p53-dependent and -independent forms of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PUMA localizes to mitochondria and interacts with antiapoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-X(L) or proapoptotic Bax in response to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> stimuli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although studies have shown that PUMA is associated with pathomechanisms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, clearly defined roles for PUMA in ischemic neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> remain unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine potential roles for PUMA in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Five minutes of transient global <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> (tGCI) were induced by bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> combined with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: PUMA was upregulated in vulnerable hippocampal CA1 neurons after tGCI as shown by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In Western blot and coimmunoprecipitation analyses, PUMA localized to mitochondria and was bound to Bcl-X(L) and Bax in the hippocampal CA1 subregion after tGCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>PUMA upregulation was inhibited by pifithrin-alpha, a specific inhibitor of p53, suggesting that PUMA is partly controlled by the p53 transcriptional pathway after tGCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, reduction in <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> by overexpression of copper/zinc <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase, which is known to be protective of vulnerable ischemic hippocampal neurons, inhibited PUMA upregulation and subsequent hippocampal CA1 neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> after tGCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results imply a potential role for PUMA in delayed CA1 neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> after tGCI and that it could be a molecular target for therapy </plain></SENT>
