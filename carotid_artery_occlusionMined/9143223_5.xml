<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We examined the effects of FK506, a specific inhibitor of calcineurin, on the binding capacity of cyclic <z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi>-dependent protein kinase (cAMP-DPK) in gerbils subjected to 2-h cerebral hemispheric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>FK506 (0.1 mg/kg) was infused intravenously at 15 min prior to the induction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> by common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The binding capacity of cAMP-DPK was evaluated by autoradiographic analysis of the cAMP binding, and cerebral blood flow (CBF) was measured by the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36927">[14C]</z:chebi> iodoantipyrine method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the sham-operated gerbils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FK506 significantly increased mean arterial blood pressure and tended to decrease CBF, suggesting that FK506 may constrict systemic blood vessels as well as cerebral blood vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, cAMP binding was not altered by FK506 in the sham-operated gerbils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> group of gerbils, FK506 prevented any significant reduction of cAMP binding in the hippocampus CA1 and cerebral cortices on the ischemic side, whereas it exerted no significant influence on the cAMP binding of the nonischemic side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The values of CBF were comparable between the vehicle-treated gerbils and FK506-treated gerbils in the ischemic regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Preservation of cAMP binding indicates that intracellular signal transduction via cAMP-DPK can be maintained by FK506 despite <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, suggesting that this agent may be beneficial for reducing ischemic tissue damage </plain></SENT>
