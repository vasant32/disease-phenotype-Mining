<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A case where a reversed flow of blood was established from the cerebral circulation into the internal carotid artery and eventually into the external carotid artery is presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Careful reading of the cerebral views of the standard carotid angiogram allowed detection of a retrograde flow into the internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Surgical exploration confirmed the patency of the internal carotid artery; the occluded common carotid artery was bypassed by a prosthesis, which restored an antegrade flow into the internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
