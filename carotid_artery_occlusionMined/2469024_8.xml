<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The gerbil brains were fixed by microwave irradiation and a total of 15 metabolites were measured from a single piece of tissue from either the hippocampus or the striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The rapid alterations in energy-related compounds and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23447">cyclic nucleotides</z:chebi> appeared to be directly related both to the loss of oxygen and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and the resupply of these nutrients during reflow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Significant reduction in the level of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25375">monoamines</z:chebi> occurred principally during reflow, at a time when the energy-related metabolites were restored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is proposed that the changes in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25375">monoamines</z:chebi> were triggered by other ischemic-induced events unrelated to energy <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
