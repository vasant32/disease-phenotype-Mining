<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Transient occlusion of the carotids for 45 min reduced the b-wave by 46% without affecting the amplitude of the a-wave </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ERG activity returned 30 min after restoration of blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Prolonged carotid occlusion for 7 days totally abolished the b-wave but enhanced the a-wave amplitude </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although b-wave amplitude suppression has been considered as an indicator of <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e>, no histological changes were seen in retinas of rats subjected to 45 min or 7 days of two-vessel occlusion, when observed by light microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi>, GABAA receptor, calretinin and PKC-alpha immunoreactivities were unaltered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> did, however, induce the expression of the cytoskeletal protein, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), in <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> Müller cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The increase in the Müller cell GFAP immunoreactivity was related to how long the carotids were occluded as well as the reperfusion time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Prolonged occlusion for 7 days resulted in a 356% increase in <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> GFAP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings show that a reduction of <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> blood flow by occlusion of the carotids causes a metabolic stress to the retina and elicits events associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002171'>gliosis</z:hpo> without resulting in 'ischaemic-like' morphological changes </plain></SENT>
