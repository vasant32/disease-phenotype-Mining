<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To elucidate the mechanism and functional significance underlying ischemic vasoconstriction, we investigated the relationship between arteriolar constriction and tissue energy metabolism during bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in gerbils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using video microscopy and microspectroscopy, the arteriolar caliber, the total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (Hb) content, and the redox state of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4056">cytochrome</z:chebi> oxidase (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16040">cyt</z:chebi>.aa3) were monitored in the cerebral cortex in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After in situ freezing of the brain, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16708">adenine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="9" ids="36976">nucleotides</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> phosphate (P-Cr), and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> levels were analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Tissue damage was also assessed immunohistochemically using antibodies against microtubule-associated proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a slight reduction of the diameter of pial arterioles during the initial 1 min of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A rapid decline of total Hb and reduction of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16040">cyt</z:chebi>.aa3 were observed with rapid decreases of P-Cr and ATP in the cortical tissue during the initial 0.5 min, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of them showed tendencies to return toward preischemic levels at 0.5-1 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Beyond 1.5 min, extensive vasoconstriction occurred together with further decline of total Hb, reduction of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16040">cyt</z:chebi>.aa3, and decreases of ATP and P-Cr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neuronal damage developed in the cerebral cortex immunohistochemically beyond 3 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The present investigation demonstrated two phases of vasoconstriction with the possibilities that the immediate vasoconstriction likely contributed to transient improvement of cortical oxygen/energy metabolism, and the second extensive vasoconstriction was an index of tissue energy failure and imminent neuronal damage </plain></SENT>
