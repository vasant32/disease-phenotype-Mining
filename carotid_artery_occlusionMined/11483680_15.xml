<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OEF methodology remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study we compare the sensitivity and specificity of absolute OEF measurements with ipsilateral-to-contralateral ratios of absolute OEF and count-based OEF estimates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Multivariate analyses of OEF methods were performed using data from patients with symptomatic carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (n = 68) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Outcome and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 3 methods were predictive of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk in univariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only the count-based method remained significant in multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The area under the ROC curve was greatest for the count-based ratio: 0.815 versus 0.769 (absolute) and 0.737 (ratios of absolute) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 3 methods are predictive of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk in patients with unilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>ROC curve analysis is useful for selecting optimal thresholds for maximal sensitivity and specificity </plain></SENT>
