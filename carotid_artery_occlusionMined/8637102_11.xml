<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Large multicenter trials (North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial, European Carotid Surgery Trial) have documented the benefits of carotid endarterectomy for treating symptomatic patients with &gt;or=70% stenosis of the internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although color-flow duplex scanning has become the preferred method for noninvasive assessment of internal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery disease</z:e>, no criteria have been generally accepted to identify this subset of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We previously reported a retrospective series to establish such criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study details our results when these criteria were applied prospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Carotid color-flow duplex scans were compared with arteriograms in 457 patients who underwent both studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Criteria for &gt;or=70% internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> were peak systolic velocity &gt;130 cm/sec and end-diastolic velocity &gt;100 cm/sec </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Internal carotid arteries with peak systolic velocity &lt;40 cm/sec in which only a trickle of flow could be detected were classified as preocclusive lesions (95% to 99% stenosis) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Arteriographic stenosis was determined by comparing the diameter of the internal carotid artery at the site of maximal stenosis to the diameter of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> distal internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> of &gt;or=70% was detected with a sensitivity of 87%, specificity of 97% positive predictive value of 89%, negative predictive value of 96%, and overall accuracy of 95% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Eighty-seven percent of 70% to 99% stenoses were correctly identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>False-positive errors (n=10) were attributed to contralateral internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> or high-grade (&gt;90%) stenosis (n=5) and to interpreter error (n=1); no explanation was apparent in the other four </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Eleven of 12 false-negative examinations occurred in patients with 70% to 80% internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In our laboratories, prospective application of the above velocity criteria identified internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> of &gt;or=70% with a reasonably high degree of accuracy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Errors occurred when stenoses were borderline and in patients with severe contralateral disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>With suitably modified velocity criteria, color-flow duplex scanning remains the most reliable noninvasive method for identifying symptomatic patients who are candidates for carotid endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
