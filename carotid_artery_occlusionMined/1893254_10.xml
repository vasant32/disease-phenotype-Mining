<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The purpose of these experiments were to study the interactions of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">N-methyl-D-aspartate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi>) with baroreceptor reflexes induced by transient carotid clamping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="17967">urethane</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> resulted in a reversible and reproducible <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in the vagotomized animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This hypertensive reaction was blocked by intraventricular injection of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi>, such as 2-amino-7-phosphono-heptaneoate (AP-7) and phencyclidine (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PCP</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also found that blood pressure-sensitive neurons of the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) could be classified into two groups, on the basis of their responses to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> given intravenously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using pressure microejection and single unit recording, we observed that clamping of the common carotids resulted in excitation of type I neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This evoked excitation, similar to that induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi>, was blocked by locally applied AP-7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the carotid occlusion-induced responses of type II neurons were not blocked by AP-7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the present data suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> receptors are involved in hypertensive responses during carotid occlusion, perhaps involving a site in the rostral ventrolateral medulla </plain></SENT>
