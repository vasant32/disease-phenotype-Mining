<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study compared whether activation of muscle ergoreceptor afferents caused by isometric muscle contraction, activation of baroreceptor afferents induced by i.v. infusion of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8093">phenylephrine</z:chebi>, or baroreceptor afferent inactivation, caused by carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, elicit similar patterns of c-Fos induction in brainstem areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Adult cats were anesthetized with alpha-chloralose, and in each case, the experimental intervention caused an increase in the arterial blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were two sets of control experiments: in both, animals underwent the same surgical procedures but then either remained at rest for the entire study, or the tibial nerve was stimulated, as in the contraction group, following muscle <z:hpo ids='HP_0003470'>paralysis</z:hpo> with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9774">tubocurarine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Following the procedures, animals rested for 90 min to allow neuronal expression of c-Fos </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Control cats showed very little c-Fos immunoreactivity (c-Fos-ir) in the brainstem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Muscle contraction induced c-Fos-ir expression mainly in the nucleus tractus solitarius, lateral reticular nucleus, lateral tegmental field, vestibular nucleus, subretrofacial nucleus, spinal trigeminal tract and in a lateral region of the periaqueductal grey (P 0.5-1.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The majority of the c-Fos-ir was found in brainstem areas contralateral to the contracted muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, muscle contraction induced c-Fos-ir in the dorsal horns of spinal segments L6-S1 on the ipsilateral side of the spinal cord </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="8093">Phenylephrine</z:chebi> infusion caused c-Fos-ir expression in the nucleus tractus solitarius, spinal trigeminal tract, solitary tract, and dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No c-Fos-ir was apparent in the periaqueductal grey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Carotid occlusions induced c-Fos-ir expression in the area postrema, nucleus tractus solitarius, solitary tract, and spinal trigeminal tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Expression was bilateral </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Areas that exhibited c-Fos-ir correspond to sites previously reported to release various neuropeptides in response to muscle contraction or carotid occlusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that the exercise pressor reflex and baroreflex activate similar, but not completely identical, sites in the brainstem </plain></SENT>
