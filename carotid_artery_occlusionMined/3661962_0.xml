<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Induction of anaesthesia was followed by a significant reduction in systolic arterial pressure and a rise in central venous pressure (CVP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thereafter CVP did not vary significantly and heart rate did not change significantly at any stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, mean systolic pressure at one minute, 143 (SD 17) mmHg, and three minutes, 160 (SD 27) mmHg, were both significantly higher than prior to occlusion, 132 (SD 17) mmHg (P less than 0.01 and P less than 0.002 respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Similar significant changes occurred in diastolic pressure after carotid occlusion (P less than 0.02 and P less than 0.002 respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The restoration of flow through the internal carotid artery in patients operated on without a shunt was associated with a significant reduction in mean systolic pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean systolic pressure at one minute, 145 (SD 20) mmHg, and three minutes, 135 (SD 19) mmHg, were both significantly lower than that before restoration of flow, 159 (SD 17) mmHg (P less than 0.02 and P less than 0.05 respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Changes in mean diastolic pressure in this group at these times, while in the same direction, were not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The observed hypertensive response to carotid occlusion may assist in preserving cerebral perfusion while the internal carotid artery is occluded, but may be hazardous for patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">ischaemic heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
