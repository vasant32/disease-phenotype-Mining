<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: 105 consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> affecting the anterior circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Four early signs were evaluated on cranial CT within six hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>: loss of the insular ribbon (LIR); attenuation of the lentiform nucleus (ALN); hemispherical sulcus effacement (HSE); and the hyperdense middle cerebral artery sign (HMCAS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> site was definitively identified on cerebral angiography within two hours of the CT examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: LIR was present in 55% of patients with internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ALN was present in 65% of patients with occlusion of the sphenoidal portion (M1) of the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>HSE was present in 47% of patients with middle cerebral artery branch occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>LIR was related independently to internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (odds ratio (OR) 2.8 (95% confidence interval, 1.2 to 6.8)), ALN to M1 occlusion (OR 2.9 (1.2 to 7.4)), and isolated HSE without ALN or LIR to branch occlusion (OR 12.8 (3.2 to 51.5)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The combined presence of the three signs was indicative of internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (p &lt; 0.05), and the presence of ALN and LIR without HSE was indicative of M1 occlusion (p &lt; 0.05) by univariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>HMCAS bore no relation to either <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: LIR, ALS, HSE, and combinations of these were useful predictors of the <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> site </plain></SENT>
