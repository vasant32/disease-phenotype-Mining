<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that extracranial-intracranial (EC-IC) bypass surgery, added to best medical therapy, reduces subsequent ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in patients with recently symptomatic AICAO and hemodynamic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Parallel-group, randomized, open-label, blinded-adjudication clinical treatment trial conducted from 2002 to 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Forty-nine clinical centers and 18 positron emission tomography (PET) centers in the United States and Canada </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The majority were academic medical centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PARTICIPANTS: Patients with arteriographically confirmed AICAO causing hemispheric symptoms within 120 days and hemodynamic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> identified by ipsilateral increased oxygen extraction fraction measured by PET </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of 195 patients who were randomized, 97 were randomized to receive surgery and 98 to no surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Follow-up for the primary end point until occurrence, 2 years, or termination of trial was 99% complete </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No participant withdrew because of adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: Anastomosis of superficial temporal artery branch to a middle cerebral artery cortical branch for the surgical group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Antithrombotic therapy and risk factor intervention were recommended for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: For <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> participants who were assigned to surgery and received surgery, the combination of (1) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from surgery through 30 days after surgery and (2) ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> within 2 years of randomization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>For the nonsurgical group and participants assigned to surgery who did not receive surgery, the combination of (1) <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from randomization to randomization plus 30 days and (2) ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> within 2 years of randomization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The trial was terminated early for futility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Two-year rates for the primary end point were 21.0% (95% CI, 12.8% to 29.2%; 20 events) for the surgical group and 22.7% (95% CI, 13.9% to 31.6%; 20 events) for the nonsurgical group (P = .78, Z test), a difference of 1.7% (95% CI, -10.4% to 13.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Thirty-day rates for ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> were 14.4% (14/97) in the surgical group and 2.0% (2/98) in the nonsurgical group, a difference of 12.4% (95% CI, 4.9% to 19.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Among participants with recently symptomatic AICAO and hemodynamic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, EC-IC bypass surgery plus medical therapy compared with medical therapy alone did not reduce the risk of recurrent ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> at 2 years </plain></SENT>
