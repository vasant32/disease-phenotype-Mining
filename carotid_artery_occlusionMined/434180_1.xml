<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During the first 15 min of CAO, SMV plasma NE increased 77% but SMV plasma DBH increased only 11% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During the second 15 min of CAO, SMV NE declined to 36% above control but SMV DBH rose further and peaked to 29% above control after CAO was released; arterial DBH and NE showed small insignificant changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Lymph DBH and NE increased simultaneously throughout the period of CAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Increases in mean arterial pressure during CAO correlated with superior mesenteric venous NE (r = 0.58, P less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In additional experiments, hepatic vein plasma NE was 74% lower than portal vein NE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, during <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> sympathetic activation, DBH and NE increase in mesenteric venous plasma and intestinal lymph but the peak response of plasma DBH lags behind that of NE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The degree of NE change in the general circulation is minimized due to hepatic clearance of NE </plain></SENT>
