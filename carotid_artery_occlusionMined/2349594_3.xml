<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Blood pressure, respiratory rate, and blood gases were recorded, and these and other gerbils were evaluated with periodic neurologic examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Blood flow to structures above the level of the diencephalon ceased almost totally during occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The lateral thalamus, the rostral three quarters of the hypothalamus, and the superior colliculi were also markedly ischemic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Blood flow to the brainstem and cerebellum was only slightly affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After release of the occlusion, blood flow was restored in some of the affected areas but to levels somewhat below that in eight sham-operated gerbils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In several areas, principally column-shaped areas in the cortex as well as patchy areas in other structures, blood flow did not recover </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This inhomogeneous blood flow distribution lasted at least 30 minutes after release of the occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thereafter, the inhomogeneity slowly disappeared in such a manner that blood flow to originally well reperfused areas appeared to decrease while that to poorly reperfused areas increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>During reflow, blood flow in the brainstem and cerebellum slowly and continuously decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We show that there is an early no-reflow phenomenon that is inhomogeneous and appears to be of vascular origin and lasts approximately 30 minutes after release of the occlusion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
