<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>With innovative devices and technology, we want to clarify the benefit and risk of interventional treatment for those patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: From 2005 to 2009, 62 patients were enrolled and 7 patients were diagnosed as total ICA occlusion with severe neurological deficit and poor collateral circulation received endovascular interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intra-arterial thrombolysis was performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the 7 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Besides, angioplasty was done in 2 patients, stenting in 3, and thrombosuction in 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The average NIHSS was 23.3 (standard deviation=3.6) before revascularization, was 14.2(standard deviation=6.8) on day 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three patients had symptomatically hemorrhagic transformation and one developed severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> after procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Decompressive craniotomy has been conducted in 3, who survived thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One patient died for refusal of decompressive craniotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The 30-day modified Rankin scale was 1 in 1, 2 in 1, 3 in 1, and 4 in 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of our patients had distal residual lesions at anterior or middle cerebral artery area, and delayed recanalization was noted in 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Endovascular therapy was promising as a hyperacute management for patients of ICA total occlusion leading to survival rate more than 80% and significant neurological recovery in 50% of our patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Distal residual lesions were common in patients of total carotid occlusion after aggressive revascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Although the mechanism was not clear, delayed re-canalization was common in such patients </plain></SENT>
