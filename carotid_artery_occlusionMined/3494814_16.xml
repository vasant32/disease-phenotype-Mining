<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Follow-up studies were carried out at a mean interval of eleven weeks after extracranial-intracranial bypass surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical improvement was observed in three patients who had presented with frequent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tia|TIA|T.I.A.">transient ischaemic attacks</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One patient with multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">vascular occlusions</z:e> suffered a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> at the time of surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Follow-up studies showed an increase of regional cerebral blood flow in only two of the twelve patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the group as a whole, there was no significant change of cerebral blood flow, oxygen consumption or fractional oxygen extraction after bypass surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most consistent post-operative change, observed in eleven of the twelve patients, was a fall of cerebral blood volume in the cortical territory of the bypassed carotid artery (p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This effect was most marked in patients with bilateral carotid occlusion, in whom there was often an accompanying fall of blood volume in the contralateral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The post-operative findings were consistent with an increase of regional cerebral perfusion pressure as a result of the bypass procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although this effect is potentially of value, those patients with most to gain from bypass surgery may also run the highest risk of peri-operative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
