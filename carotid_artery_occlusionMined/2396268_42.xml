<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The bolus intravenous administration of 25,000 units of liposome-entrapped CuZn-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase elevated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase activities in the blood and brain 1, 2, 8, and 24 hours later as well as in the ischemic hemisphere and contralateral cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Determined 24 hours after right middle cerebral and bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> by the lack of staining for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> dehydrogenase activity with 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> sizes were reduced by 33%, 25%, and 18% in the anterior, middle, and posterior brain slices, respectively, by treatment with liposome-entrapped CuZn-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our data demonstrate that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> radicals are important determinants of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size following focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and that liposome-entrapped CuZn-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase may have pharmacologic value for the treatment of focal cerebral ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
