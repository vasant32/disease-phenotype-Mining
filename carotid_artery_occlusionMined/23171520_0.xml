<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, excessive activity of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), and in particular MMP-9, has been implicated in the aetiology of HI injuries to the immature brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our previous study suggested that MMP-9 may be involved in the development of the delayed injury processes following HI injury to the developing brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Given this, we therefore propose that MMP-9 may be a useful target for rescue therapies in the injured developing brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To address this, we chose to use SB-3CT, a highly selective inhibitor that is known to target only MMP-2 and MMP-9, to attenuate the elevated MMP-9 activity seen following HI injury to the developing brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one-day-old postnatal Wistar rats were subjected to unilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> followed by exposure to <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> (8% oxygen for 1 h) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SB-3CT (50 mg/kg body weight in 25% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28262">dimethyl sulphoxide</z:chebi>/75% <z:chebi fb="1" ids="46793">polyethylene glycol</z:chebi>) or an equal volume of vehicle or saline diluent was then administered intraperitoneally at 2, 5 and 14 h following the insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Gelatin zymography revealed that pro-MMP-9 levels were significantly reduced at 6 h following hypoxic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> (p â‰¤ 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, our results showed that despite significantly inhibiting brain pro-MMP-9 activity after hypoxic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e>, SB-3CT failed to confer significant neuroprotection in postnatal day 21 rats 3 days after an HI insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further investigations are warranted using a recently reported selective water-soluble version of SB-3CT or another MMP-9 selective inhibitor to resolve the role of MMP-9 in the aetiology of HI injury in the developing brain </plain></SENT>
