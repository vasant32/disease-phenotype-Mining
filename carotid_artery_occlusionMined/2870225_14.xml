<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These findings support the existence of compensatory cerebral vasodilatation above a carotid occlusion and suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tia|TIA|T.I.A.">transient ischaemic attacks</z:e> in patients with carotid occlusion may be flow-related rather than embolic phenomena </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These patients may therefore benefit from extracranial-intracranial surgical revascularisation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The method presented is non-invasive and therefore ideally suited for use as a screening test or in follow-up studies </plain></SENT>
