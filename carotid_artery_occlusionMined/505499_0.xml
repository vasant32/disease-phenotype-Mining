<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Animals used included renovascular hypertensive rats (RHR) with an altered renin-angiotensin system and desoxycorticosterone hypertensive rats (DHR) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003351'>low plasma renin activity</z:hpo> (PRA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mean value for supratentorial <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> of 7.41 mM/kg in RHR was significantly higher than in DHR (3.90 MM/kg) or in control normotensive rats (3.10 - 2.56 mM/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Concomitantly, the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> ratio tended to increase and ATP to decrease in RHR only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In these same rats (RHR) infratentorial <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> was also increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that bilateral carotid occlusion leads to anaerobic metabolism of the brain in RHR but not in DHR, suggesting that the renin-angiotensin system may play some role in the susceptibility to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> following carotid occlusion in the hypertensive rats </plain></SENT>
