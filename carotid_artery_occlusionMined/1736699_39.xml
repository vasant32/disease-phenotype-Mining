<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one fasted Wistar-Kyoto rats were assigned to one of three groups (n = 7); 1.3 MAC (end-tidal) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi>-normothermia (pericranial temperature 38.0 degrees C), 1.3 MAC <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi>-normothermia, and 1.3 MAC <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi>-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> (pericranial temperature 35.0 degrees C during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In each animal the trachea was intubated and the lungs were mechanically ventilated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each animal was subjected to temporary incomplete forebrain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> induced by 10 min of bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> with simultaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> (mean arterial pressure 35 mmHg) induced by trimetaphan and blood withdrawal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After a 3-day survival period, perfusion-fixation was performed, and two blinded observers assessed histopathologic injury according to a four-point scale (0 = no damage; 1 = less than 10% of neurons damaged; 2 = 10-50% damaged; and 3 = greater than 50% damaged) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The assessment was performed at two points in the rostrocaudal axis chosen to permit evaluation of regions with varying levels of ischemic damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the rostral sections, in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi>- and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi>-normothermia groups, moderate to severe injury was observed in striatum, cerebral cortex, hippocampus (CA1 and CA3 areas), and reticular nucleus of the thalamus (e.g., the median scores for the CA1 area were 3 in both the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi>-<z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi>-normothermia groups), and there were no differences between the two groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
