<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although risk of embolism can be minimized, detecting compromised collateral circulation is more difficult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cerebral angiography, carotid stump pressures and clinical evaluation during internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> are of limited utility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">Xenon</z:chebi>-133 radionuclide studies and stable <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi> computed tomography are not readily available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We evaluated 99mTc-HMPAO SPECT, during temporary carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, in 20 patients considered for internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fourteen demonstrated symmetric cerebral perfusion during occlusion; eleven underwent transient and three had permanent carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> without complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five patients had ipsilateral globally decreased perfusion during temporary occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One patient underwent transient occlusion of this vessel and one underwent carotid sacrifice without bypass grafting; both recovered without sequelae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The three remaining patients underwent carotid artery bypass grafting prior to sacrifice of this vessel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One patient with a small focal perfusion defect underwent carotid artery sacrifice without bypass grafting and developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> neurologic deficits postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These initial results suggest that symmetric cerebral perfusion during temporary occlusion indicates that internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> will be tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although its implications are not yet well defined, the abnormal study identifies patients potentially at risk for postocclusion complications, thus providing a basis for neurosurgical management </plain></SENT>
