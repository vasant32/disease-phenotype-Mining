<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We report 6 cases of complications occurring after roller-coaster rides and analyze published data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Complications seen our patients included 5 cervicoencephalic <z:hpo ids='HP_0005294'>arterial dissections</z:hpo>, one with brainstem dysfunction due to extending <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0270771" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">syringobulbia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Reported data include one cervicoencephalic <z:hpo ids='HP_0005294'>arterial dissection</z:hpo>, one case of carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, 3 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100309'>subdural hematoma</z:hpo>, one with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, one with cerebrospinal fluid leak, and one with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751693" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Brown-Séquard syndrome</z:e> secondary to an enterogenous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cyst</z:mpath> of the spinal cord </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, pain was the first symptom experienced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 71.4% of cases, it occurred immediately after the trauma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Marfanís syndrome may be the only risk factor identifiable prior to exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms of most complications are poorly understood but are likely to involve sudden head and neck flexion-extension movements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Neurological complications occurring after roller-coaster rides are highly uncommon, but may leave invalidating sequelae or be fatal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Clinicians should be aware of these complications so these patients can be given proper care early, particularly at the stage when pain is the only sign </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Early management could help limit the consequences of these complications </plain></SENT>
