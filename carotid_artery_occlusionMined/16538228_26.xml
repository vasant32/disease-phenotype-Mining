<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have revealed that the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) pathway is involved in apoptotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> after experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The serine-threonine kinase, Akt, functions in the PI3-K pathway and prevents <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> by phosphorylation at Ser473 after a variety of cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> stimuli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After phosphorylation, activated Akt inactivates other apoptogenic factors, including <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> synthase kinase-3beta (GSK3beta), thereby inhibiting cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the role of Akt/GSK3beta signaling in the delayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of hippocampal neurons in the CA1 subregion after transient global <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> (tGCI) has not been clarified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transient global <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> for 5 mins was induced by bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> combined with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Western blot analysis showed a significant increase in phospho-Akt (Ser473) and phospho-GSK3beta (Ser9) in the hippocampal CA1 subregion after tGCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry showed that expression of phospho-Akt (Ser473) and phospho-GSK3beta (Ser9) was markedly increased in the vulnerable CA1 subregion, but not in the ischemic-tolerant CA3 subregion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Double staining with phospho-GSK3beta (Ser9) and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16704">uridine</z:chebi> 5'-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15266,18036">triphosphate</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi> nick end labeling showed different cellular distributions in the CA1 subregion 3 days after tGCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Phosphorylation of Akt and GSK3beta was prevented by LY294002, a PI3-K inhibitor, which facilitated subsequent DNA fragmentation 3 days after tGCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, transgenic rats that overexpress copper/zinc-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase, which is known to be neuroprotective against delayed hippocampal CA1 injury after tGCI, had enhanced and persistent phosphorylation of both Akt and GSK3beta after tGCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that activation of the Akt/GSK3beta signaling pathway may mediate survival of vulnerable hippocampal CA1 neurons after tGCI </plain></SENT>
