<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although several studies have compared the results of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) with primary closure (PC) versus patch closure, none have compared the outcome of bilateral CEAs with patch versus PC performed on the same patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This prospective randomized study compares the clinical outcome and incidence of recurrent stenosis (&gt;/=80%) for CEA with PC versus patch closure in patients with bilateral CEAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This study includes 74 patients with bilateral CEAs with PC on one side and patching on the other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were randomized to sequential operative treatment of either patching/PC or PC/patching </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Postoperative duplex ultrasounds and clinical follow-up were done at 1, 6, and 12 months and every year thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to estimate the risk of significant restenosis (&gt;/=80%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Demographic characteristics and the mean operative diameter of the internal carotid artery were similar for both PC and patching </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up was 29 months (range, 6 to 65 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The incidence of ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was 4% for PC versus 0% for patching </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>PC had a significantly higher incidence of neurological complications (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> combined) than patching (12% versus 1%; P=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Operative mortality was 0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>PC had a higher incidence of recurrent stenosis (22% versus 1%; P&lt;0.003) and total internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (8% versus 0%; P=0.04) than patching </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Restenoses necessitating a repeated CEA were also higher for PC (14%) than for patching (1%; P=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that patching had a significantly better cumulative patency rate than PC (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This analysis also showed that freedom from recurrent stenosis at 24 months was 75% for PC and 98% for patching </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patch closure is less likely than PC to cause ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo>, and recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The higher rate of unilateral recurrent stenosis may suggest that local factors play a more significant role than systemic factors in the etiology of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
