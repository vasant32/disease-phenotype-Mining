<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BCO significantly decreased cerebral blood flow (CBF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Reperfusion CBF at 10 min and 2, 3 and 4 h was significantly below preischaemic control values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>BCO decreased SEP amplitude but had no effect on EP-P3 central conduction time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BCO did significantly increase EP-P11 central conduction time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Reperfusion amplitudes at 10 min and 2, 3 and 4 h revealed a significant increase only at 4 h when compared to the ischaemic amplitude </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>EP-P11 central conduction time at 10 min reperfusion showed dramatic improvement compared to ischaemic values, although values at 2, 3 and 4 h reperfusion were not statistically different from ischaemic values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A separate group of animals prepared identically but without BCO showed no significant changes in either SEP or CBF over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These studies establish the protocol necessary to measure SEP in the Mongolian gerbil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the future SEP may be used as an integral tool in the study of the primary determinants of neurophysiological recovery following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
