<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We identified 11 patients with ICA occlusion and ipsilateral ECA stenosis who underwent ECA endarterectomy to determine its role in treating extracranial cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Follow-up ranged from 1-65 months, with a mean of 27 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seven of eight patients with unilateral disease remained symptom free </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The eighth patient had recurrent symptoms that were subsequently diagnosed as hemi-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001300'>Parkinsonism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two of three patients with bilateral occlusive disease had developed non-hemispheric symptoms at 12 and 24 months, respectively; the third remains asymptomatic after extracranial-intracranial bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>None of the seven patients who presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100576'>amaurosis fugax</z:hpo> had recurrent visual symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>ECA endarterectomy is a safe and effective operation in treating symptomatic patients with ICA occlusion, especially those with transient monocular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000618'>blindness</z:hpo> or unilateral occlusive disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is less effective in those patients who have diffuse bilateral occlusive disease </plain></SENT>
