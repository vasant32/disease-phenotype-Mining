<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we evaluated the protective effects of low-dose subcutaneous GYKI-52466 preconditioning in a rat model of hypoxic-ischaemic (HI) brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Male Sprague Dawley rats (postnatal day 26) were administered saline or GYKI-52466 (GYKI; 3 mg/kg, 90 min; 1 mg/kg, twice in 120 min; or 0.5 mg/kg, thrice in 180 min) prior to left common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (CCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Animals were allowed to recover for 2 hrs, and then placed in a <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> chamber (8% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi>/92% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17997">N(2)</z:chebi>; 33±1°C) for 1 hr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A sham surgery group received saline without HI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>Seizure</z:hpo> activity was scored during <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> and sensorimotor tests performed before surgery and at 1, 7, 14 and 90 days post-HI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On days 14 and 90 brains were fixed and sectioned for assessment of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and ventricular enlargement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Low-dose GYKI-52466 preconditioning significantly reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and ventricular enlargement relative to saline treated controls at day 14 after HI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On day 90, tissue loss was significantly reduced by GYKI 3 mg/kg compared to saline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Foot-faults, paw use asymmetry, and postural reflex scores were significantly improved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> GYKI treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our results show that GYKI-52466 is effective at doses well-below, and at pre-administration intervals well-beyond previous studies, and suggest that a classical blockade of ionotropic AMPA receptors does not underlie its neuroprotective effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Low-dose GYKI-52466 preconditioning represents a novel, prophylactic strategy for neuroprotection in a field almost devoid of effective pharmaceuticals </plain></SENT>
