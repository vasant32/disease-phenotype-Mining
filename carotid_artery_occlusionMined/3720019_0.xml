<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The pressor responses to intravenous infusions of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> were significantly larger in the <z:chebi fb="71" ids="17303">morphine</z:chebi> premedicated greyhounds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In greyhounds anaesthetized with <z:chebi fb="71" ids="17303">morphine</z:chebi> and chloralose, pressor responses to vertebral artery <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> were potentiated following the administration of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7459">naloxone</z:chebi> via either a vertebral artery or intravenously although the effect was more consistent with the former route </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No such effect was seen in greyhounds anaesthetized with chloralose alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="7459">Naloxone</z:chebi> had no effect on the pressor responses to intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> or carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The heart rate responses to vertebral artery <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> in greyhounds anaesthetized with <z:chebi fb="71" ids="17303">morphine</z:chebi> and chloralose were potentiated by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7459">naloxone</z:chebi> such that they were not significantly different from the responses obtained in greyhounds anaesthetized with chloralose alone before <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7459">naloxone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As was observed with the pressor responses, the potentiation was more apparent with the vertebral artery route of administration of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7459">naloxone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no potentiation of the heart rate responses in the chloralose group of greyhounds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that <z:chebi fb="71" ids="17303">morphine</z:chebi> premedication may repress the vagal withdrawal mechanism while potentiating the sympathetic vasomotor mechanism mediating the central cardiovascular actions of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
