<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hippocampal theta waves, approximately 180 degree out of phase in <z:chebi fb="43" ids="53200">PCL</z:chebi> and DG, appeared within 4.3 +/- 2.3 seconds after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and continued for more than 60 minute </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These hippocampal theta waves disappeared 34.2 +/- 10.2 seconds after 4 vessel occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We could not find the clear difference between the two areas in the appearance and disappearance of the hippocampal theta waves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We further investigated the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9536">thiamylal</z:chebi>, ketamine and nicardipine on the hippocampal theta waves during bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="9536">Thiamylal</z:chebi> changed the two hippocampal theta waves to a similar pattern of EEG, which has irregular slow and fast waves, in both <z:chebi fb="43" ids="53200">PCL</z:chebi> and DG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ketamine changed the two theta waves to irregular complex pattern of fast and slow waves and spike activity, which is independent at two areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nicardipine, a Ca <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, changed the theta waves to irregular slow waves which were similar to the pattern of EEG observed before carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9536">thiamylal</z:chebi>, ketamine and nicardipine have different effects on the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> of hippocampus </plain></SENT>
