<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent studies suggest that the neuroprotective effects of Epo may depend upon different mechanisms, including the inhibition of nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We recently demonstrated that Epo exerts neuroprotection in a model of neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we directly determined whether systemic administration of recombinant Epo modulates cerebral NO production in a neonatal rat model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0752304" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoxic-ischemic brain injury</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seven-day-old Wistar rat pups were subjected to left carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> followed by 2.5 h of hypoxic exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Brain <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> levels were evaluated in both hemispheres (carotid ligated or nonligated) by Griess reagent 72 h after the hypoxic-ischemic insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results show that hypoxic-ischemic insult results a significant increase in NO production as compared with NO levels in hypoxic hemispheres and control animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A single dose of Epo treatment (1,000 U/kg i.p.) significantly decreased NO overproduction in the hypoxic-ischemic hemisphere, whereas no significant change appeared in <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> alone or in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that the selective inhibitory effect of Epo on NO overproduction could have a neuroprotective effect in neonatal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0752304" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoxic-ischemic brain injury</z:e> </plain></SENT>
