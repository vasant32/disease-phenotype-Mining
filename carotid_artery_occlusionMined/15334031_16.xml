<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We have previously shown that erythropoietin (Epo) exerts neuroprotective effects in the Rice-Vannucci model of neonatal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0752304" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoxic-ischemic brain injury</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanisms of Epo protection in this model are still unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: In the present study, we studied the effects of systemically administered Epo on <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation levels and <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> enzyme (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> peroxidase) activities following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0752304" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoxic-ischemic brain injury</z:e> in neonatal rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seven-day-old Wistar rat pups were subjected to left carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> followed by 2.5 h of hypoxic exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Brain <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation levels and <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> enzyme activities were measured in the injured hemispheres 24 h after the hypoxic-ischemic insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Hypoxic-ischemic injury significantly increased the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33202">thiobarbituric acid</z:chebi>-reactive substance levels in the injured hemispheres as compared to the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> peroxidase activity was significantly elevated in Epo-treated animals compared to saline-treated animals and the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that Epo exerts neuroprotective effects against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0752304" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoxic-ischemic brain injury</z:e> at least partially via the modulation of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> enzyme activity </plain></SENT>
