<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There was a clear correlation of the clinical picture with the CT demonstration of cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>; 14 patients had no identifiable <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The findings were also correlated with angiographic data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The degree of cross or collateral filling of the middle cerebral artery on the affected side correlated better with the clinical features than with the CT data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Radioisotope studies were positive in only 50% of cases in which CT had shown infarction; this was related to the time interval between the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms and scanning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The significance of these findings and their relationship to previous clinical necropsy data are discussed </plain></SENT>
