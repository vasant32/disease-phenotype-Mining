<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Extracranial carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> are quite <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0678236" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rare diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Their importance is linked both to critical localization and natural history which can lead to neurological events such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The importance of an accurate diagnosis is related to the necessity to carry out an early repair of these lesions and so to achieve the prevention of serious complications with minimal surgical risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: At the Department of Vascular Surgery of the University of Florence from January 1982 to December 1995, 2138 surgical procedures on extracranial carotid arteries carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one (0.98%) were performed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the basis of clinical history and instrumental findings we divided the patients into three groups: atherosclerotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> (AA, 10 cases), dysplasic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp>, 6 cases) and pseudoaneurysms (PA, 5 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Global mortality and major morbility rate was 4.7% (one patient suffered perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eighteen (85.7%) were followed by echo color Doppler </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No one stenosis and/or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of operated vessel was observed during the mean follow-up period of 24 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In one case (5.5%) of pseudoaneurysms group an asymptomatic internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was discovered 3 months after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In our experience, surgical treatment of extracranial carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> is associated with satisfactory results and low incidence of perioperative complications that justified an extensive and early surgical therapy </plain></SENT>
