<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have studied the postoperative patency of the internal and external carotid arteries using continuous wave Doppler ultrasound with spectral analysis (Spectrascribe BOC--Medishield) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seventy-nine patients who had had 89 endarterectomies during the past 5 years entered the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up was 21 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients had an occluded internal carotid artery of whom 4 had suffered an immediate postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and 1 a delayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tia|TIA|T.I.A.">transient ischaemic attacks</z:e> occurred in another 4 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the 60 patients with a patent internal carotid artery one suffered an immediate postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and 2 a delayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>; 6 patients had recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tia|TIA|T.I.A.">transient ischaemic attacks</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>None of the 5 patients who had an external carotid endarterectomy developed postoperative symptoms, although there was occlusion in 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The carotid artery was occluded in 4 of 43 completely asymptomatic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, 18 per cent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> carotid endarterectomies and 9 per cent of asymptomatic patients in this series had postoperative occlusion of the carotid artery </plain></SENT>
