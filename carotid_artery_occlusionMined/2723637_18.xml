<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to determine whether administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28240">dichloroacetate</z:chebi> (DCA), an activator of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (PDH), improves recovery of energy metabolites following transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Gerbils were pretreated with DCA, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was produced using bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> for 20 min, followed by reperfusion up to 4 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DCA had no effect on the accumulation of <z:chebi fb="22" ids="28358">lactic acid</z:chebi> and the decrease in ATP and phosphocreatine (PCr) during the 20-min insult, nor on the recovery of these metabolites measured at 20 and 60 min reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, at 4 h reperfusion, levels of ATP and PCr were significantly higher in DCA-treated animals than in controls, as PCr exhibited a secondary decrease in caudate nucleus of control animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PDH was markedly inhibited at 20 min reperfusion in both groups, but was reactivated to a greater extent in DCA-treated animals at 60 min and 4 h reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that DCA had no effect on the initial recovery of metabolites following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">transient ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, later in reperfusion, DCA enhanced the postischemic reactivation of PDH and prevented the secondary failure of energy metabolism in caudate nucleus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, inhibition of PDH may limit the recovery of energy metabolism following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
