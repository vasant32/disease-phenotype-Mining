<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> followed by reperfusion, produced a significant rise in cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size along with impairment of memory and motor coordination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ischemic post-conditioning involving three episodes of 10 s carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> with intermittent reperfusion of 10 s proceeding prolonged ischemic insult of 12 min, produced a significant decrease in cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size along with reversal of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion-induced impairment of memory and motor coordination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ischemic post-conditioning-induced neuroprotective effects were significantly abolished by pretreatment with dichlorobenzamil (DBZ 0.5, 1 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi>/Ca(2+) exchange inhibitor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It may be concluded that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi>/Ca(2+) exchanger possibly plays an important role in ischemic post-conditioning-induced neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
