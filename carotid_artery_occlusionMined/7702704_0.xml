<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Gerbils were treated orally with BPS (1-100 micrograms/kg) 30 min before occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pathological evaluation of neural damage in the CA1 region of the hippocampus was performed 7 d after the ischemic insults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the symptomatic group, in which the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> index score was &gt; 10, symptomatic behaviors, such as head cocked, splayed out hind limb, <z:mp ids='MP_0001394'>circling</z:mp>, and various similar behaviors, were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pathologically, almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> CA1 neurons were destroyed 7 d after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in the symptomatic group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>BPS improved the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> index during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and neuropathological changes 7 d later, with statistical significant improvement occurring at a dose of 100 micrograms/kg </plain></SENT>
