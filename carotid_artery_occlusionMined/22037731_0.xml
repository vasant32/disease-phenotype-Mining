<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL/METHODS: Thirty-six male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 3 groups - control group (Group C, n=12), bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arteries occlusion</z:mp> group (Group B, n=12) and remote ischemic precondition group (Group P, n=12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In Group P, remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) was performed on the right femoral artery with 3 cycles (10 min) of occlusion/perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After 3 cycles of preconditioning, bilateral carotid arteries were occluded immediately for 60 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In Group B, ischemic insults were conducted without RIPC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sham surgeries were performed in Group C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Evaluation of memory and learning capacity was performed on days 5-8 after surgery by <z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water maze</z:mp> testing of spatial learning capacity (n=6 for each group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath> of cells in the hippocampus region was determined by TUNEL tests and Bcl-2 at this region was determined by ELISA 24 h and 9 days after vessel occlusion (n=6 for each group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Neurocognitive tests showed that latency time was significantly longer in Group B than in Group P on day 7 (p=0.016) and day 8 (p=0.036) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, frequency of platform crossings was significant less in group B than in the other 2 groups on day 9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Bcl-2 level was significantly increased in the hippocampal region of rats in Group P on days 1 and 9 after vessel occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>TUNEL test showed that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> could be observed at 24 h after occlusion in Group B, but not in Group P and Group C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was observed on day 9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that RIPC can protect neurocognitive function of rats after bilateral carotid occlusions, and that Bcl-2 may play an important role in this protective effect </plain></SENT>
