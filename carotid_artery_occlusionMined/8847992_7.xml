<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study examined the effect of moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> on the expression of heat shock protein (<z:chebi fb="24" ids="50430">HSP</z:chebi>)-72 following transient forebrain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in gerbils by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Global forebrain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> with concurrent moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> (30 degrees C) was induced in gerbils by 10-minute bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> followed by recirculation periods of 1 hour (h), 6h, 24h, and 48h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Normothermic forebrain ischemic animals with similar recirculation periods were utilized for comparison of the <z:chebi fb="24" ids="50430">HSP</z:chebi> expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sham-operated normothermic and hypothermic animals were also included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>72-kDa heat shock protein immunoreactivity was demonstrated in the hippocampus and neocortex of the normothermic ischemic animals following 24h and 48h recirculation similar to that reported previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the immunoreactivity was absent in the brains of the animals subjected to hypothermic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> or sham-operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only the ependymal cells were immunopositive in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> hypothermic brains as was the case with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> normothermic brains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The hypothermic ischemic brains showed no significant <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> in the hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the protection of ischemic neuronal <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> conferred by intra-ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> is not associated with induction of <z:chebi fb="24" ids="50430">HSP</z:chebi>-72 protein and that mechanisms other then <z:chebi fb="24" ids="50430">HSP</z:chebi>-72 protein induction are likely to be responsible for this neuroprotective effect </plain></SENT>
