<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Cerebrovascular disorders in children is a rare clinical entity, epidemiologic studies of which are very scarce in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hence this study analyzed 13,131 sick children admitted to Children's General Hospital in light of the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accident</z:hpo> in children and its specific characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this paper, the cases of cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> are analyzed with special reference to their developmental outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results show that one hundred twenty children (0.85 percent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> sick children) had cerebrovascular disorders documented both in clinical pictures and CT scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This number accounted for 2.5% of 4,738 CT examinations performed for these sick children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were 79 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo>, 24 of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> and 17 of vascular anomalies, 65.8%, 20.0% and 14.2% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> group, there was a different pathophysiology in each age group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The fact that <z:mp ids='MP_0001917'>intraventricular hemorrhage</z:mp> occurred in premature neonates, subarachnoid or posterior fossa <z:hpo ids='HP_0100309'>subdural hemorrhage</z:hpo> in mature neonates and infants, and intracerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> in elder children due to different causes was very striking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> group, the middle cerebral artery was most commonly affected (11 out of 24 cases); others had various lesions such as lacunar <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and so on </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The most impressive but disappointing fact in those children was that their clinical pictures were quite miserable, revealing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0848034" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">low IQs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Nine out of 24 children with cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> had IQs below 20 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the abnormal vessels group, there were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformation</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysm</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="PKWS">Sturge-Weber syndrome</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022716" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MNK">Menkes disease</z:e> and coiling of the internal carotid or vertebral arteries each demonstrating unique angiographic findings.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
