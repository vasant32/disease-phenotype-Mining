<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in the presence of contralateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> has high reported rates of perioperative morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to determine if there is a clinical benefit to patients who receive carotid artery stenting (CAS) compared to CEA in the presence of contralateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a retrospective medical chart review over a 4.5-year institutional experience of persons with contralateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and ipsilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> who underwent CAS or CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The main outcome measures were 30-day cardiac, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and mortality rate, and midterm mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of a total of 713 patients treated for carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> during this time period, 57 had contralateral occlusion (~8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirty-nine of these patients were treated with CAS, and 18 with CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most common indications for CAS were prior neck surgery (18), contralateral internal carotid occlusion (nine), and prior neck radiation (seven) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The average age was 70 ± 8.5 for CEA and 66.7 ± 9.3 for CAS (P = .20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both groups were predominantly men (CEA 12 of 18; CAS 28 of 39; P = .76), with similar prevalence of symptomatic lesions (CEA 8 of 18, CAS 20 of 39; P = .77) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two patients died within 30 days in the CAS group (5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occurred within 30 days in the CEA group (P = .50); the mortality rate for CAS and CEA combined was 3.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> occurred in either group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Two <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> occurred after CAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>At mean follow-up of 29.4 ± 16 months (CEA) and 28 ± 14.4 months (CAS; range, 1.5-48.5 months), seven <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occurred in the CAS group and one in the CEA group (17.9% vs 5.5%; P = .40) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>There were two reinterventions in the CAS group for in-stent restenosis and there were no reoperations in the CEA group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although CEA and CAS can both be performed with good perioperative results and acceptable midterm mortality, the observed outcomes do not support use of contralateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> as a selection criterion for CAS over CEA in the absence of other indications </plain></SENT>
