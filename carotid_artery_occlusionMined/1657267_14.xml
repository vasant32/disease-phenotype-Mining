<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effect of a novel, highly potent and selective kappa-opioid receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi>, GR89696, has been evaluated in two animal models of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e>: transient bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in the Mongolian gerbil and permanent, unilateral middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in the mouse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the Mongolian gerbil model, administration of GR89696 (3 to 30 micrograms kg-1, s.c.), immediately before and at 4 h after insult, produced a dose-dependent reduction in the hippocampal CA1 neuronal cell loss resulting from a 7-min bilateral carotid occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Similar effects were obtained with two other kappa-<z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi>, GR86014 (1 mgkg-1, s.c.) and GR91272 (1 mgkg-1, s.c.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The neuroprotective effect of GR89696 was completely blocked by prior administration of the opioid receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="7" ids="121459">naltrexone</z:chebi>, at 10 mgkg-1, s.c </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Repeated post-treatment with GR89696 (100 micrograms kg-1, s.c.) or GR44821 (10 mgkg-1, s.c.) was also effective in protecting completely the hippocampal CA1 neurones from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegeneration</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the permanent, unilateral middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> model in the mouse, repeated administration of GR89696 at 300 micrograms kg-1, s.c. produced a 50% reduction in cerebrocortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In these experiments GR89696 was dosed 5 min, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24 h after occlusion on the first day and then three times daily for the next three days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>GR89696 (300 micrograms kg-1) also produced a significant 35% reduction in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume in this model when the initiation of dosing was delayed for 6 h after the insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that the potent kappa-opioid receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi>, GR89696, is neuroprotective in both global and focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> models and suggest that, with this class of compound, there may be a considerable time window for pharmacological intervention </plain></SENT>
