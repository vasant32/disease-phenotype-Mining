<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The alteration of the neocortex consisted of shrinkage of the neurons surrounded by swollen astrocytic processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Distension of the rough endoplasmic reticulum of the neuronal cytoplasm appeared early, while changes of the mitochondria were slight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Though there appeared slight to moderate perivascular astrocytic swelling, endothelial swelling was rare and there was no severe narrowing of the capillary lumen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were no filling defects of colloidal carbon injected to the blood vessels of the ischemic brains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ischemic neuronal alterations were proved to develop in the absence of severe morphological changes of the microvasculature in the developing cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in the present experimental model </plain></SENT>
