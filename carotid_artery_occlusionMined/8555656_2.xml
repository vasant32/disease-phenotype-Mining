<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Volume flow rate (VFR) estimates now allow accurate quantification of the effect of cerebrovascular lesions on the conduit vessels, with excellent in vivo and in vitro correlation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four selected cases with VFR data and angiographic correlation are presented to illustrate potential clinical uses of this method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The VFR estimates were obtained with a color M-mode-based velocity imaging technique, which uses time-domain processing (P-700 Color Velocity Imaging System, Philips Ultrasound International, Irvine, CA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a patient awaiting coronary artery surgery, with unilateral internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and contralateral angiographic stenosis (50-80%, reader variation), the baseline and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi>-challenged common carotid artery VFRs showed excellent conduit function ipsilateral to this stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, the angiographic stenosis did not have significant hemodynamic effects and endarterectomy was avoided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a patient with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformation</z:hpo> fed by the left vertebral and left external carotid arteries, high in the left cervical region, VFR estimates of two to three times <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> predicted the feeding vessels, influenced management, and proved helpful in follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038531" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">subclavian steal syndrome</z:e>, VFR estimates quantified the steal after brachial hyperemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, in a patient with delayed vasoconstriction after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, very low VFR estimates preceded clinical deterioration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Quantification of hemodynamic changes with VFR estimates was useful for the diagnosis, management, and follow-up of these patients with four types of cerebrovascular disease, and should be applicable in many others </plain></SENT>
