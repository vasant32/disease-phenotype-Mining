<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to analyze risk factors and ischemic symptomatology in patients with postoperative ICA occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During one year period, 33 patients with postoperative ICA occlusion were examined at Cerebrovascular Laboratory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Medical history, clinical findings and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> risk factors were compared with data on 33 patients with satisfactory postoperative finding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Student's t-test was used on data comparison (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 31 of 33 patients, ICA occlusion was recorded on the first postoperative examination, 3 months after carotid endarterectomy (18 right and 15 left) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 8 patients, combined occlusion of the common carotid artery and ICA was found (4 right, 4 left) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One patient ICA developed occlusion during the first and third postoperative year each </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Clinically, three patients presented with ischemic symptoms (one <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and two transitory ischemic attacks (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The following risk factors were present in the group with postoperative ICA occlusion: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in 18, smoking in 10, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo> in 8, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> in 9, history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in 13, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> in 3, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027051" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MR|mi|AMI">heart attack</z:e> in 4 and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary disease</z:hpo> in 3 patients; the respective figures in the control group were as follows: 25, 11, 16, 7, 7, 3, 4 and 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no significant between-group difference in the presence of risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Study results suggested that postoperative ICA occlusion was not caused by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> risk factors but by perioperative complications </plain></SENT>
