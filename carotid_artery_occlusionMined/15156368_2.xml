<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present here a case of spontaneous recanalization of an acutely occluded internal carotid artery, angiographically reported, which later allowed the patient to benefit from surgical treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These and other similar cases raise the possibility of a more frequent recanalization of this artery than previously considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We suggest routine follow-up of these patients to detect this eventuality, which could influence clinical outcome and secondary prophylaxis strategies </plain></SENT>
