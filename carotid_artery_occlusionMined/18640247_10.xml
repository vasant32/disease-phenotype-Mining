<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study we aimed to evaluate detailed cellular stress responses and neurodegenerative changes in the retinas in rat focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and hypoperfusion models involving invasive vascular manipulations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Independent groups of adult male Wistar rats were subjected to i) transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (tMCAO), ii) permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (pMCAO), iii) cortical photothrombosis of the sensorimotor cortex using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52261">Rose Bengal</z:chebi> dye or iv) bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (BCCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rats were killed, and their eyes with the optic nerves enucleated and processed for histology, immunohistochemistry for neuronal nuclei (NeuN), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF-1alpha), c-fos, alphaB-crystallin, heat shock protein (<z:chebi fb="24" ids="50430">HSP</z:chebi>) 27, HSP60 and HSP70, and detection of DNA defragmentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The total number of the <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> ganglion cell layer (RGCL) neurons and GFAP-immunoreactive astrocytes located in the nerve fiber layer were estimated using unbiased stereological counting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our findings indicate that although permanent and transient MCAO does not cause detectable morphological alterations in the retina or optic nerve, it evokes ischemic stress as revealed by HIF-1alpha and <z:chebi fb="24" ids="50430">HSPs</z:chebi> expression in the RGCL neurons and reactive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002171'>gliosis</z:hpo> in the Müller cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Severe neurodegenerative changes in the retina and optic nerve of the BCCAO rats are accompanied by a significant increase in immunoreactivities for the c-fos, HSP27 and HSP70 as compared with the sham-operated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The retinas from the ipsilateral side of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52261">Rose Bengal</z:chebi> model showed a significant decrease in the total number of NeuN-positive neurons in the RGCL as compared with the contralateral ones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, these eyes did not differ between each other in the <z:chebi fb="24" ids="50430">HSPs</z:chebi> and HIF-1alpha expression or in the GFAP-immunoreactivity of the Müller cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our data suggest differential expression of various <z:chebi fb="24" ids="50430">HSPs</z:chebi> in the retina and possibly their distinct roles in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-mediated stress response and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegeneration</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
