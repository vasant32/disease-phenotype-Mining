<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Experiments were conducted in anesthetized rats to determine the effect of unilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> on the reflex <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> caused by elevated arterial pressure (AP) and on <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46631">clonidine</z:chebi>'s ability to potentiate that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AP was recorded by catheterizing the carotid (CA-cath) or the iliac (IA-cath) artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Elevated AP was obtained by rapid intravenous injection of methoxamine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rats with CA-cath had higher APs and heart rates (HRs) than rats with IA-cath </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The maximum increase in AP and reflex decrease in HR caused by methoxamine did not differ between sites of recording </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="4" ids="46631">Clonidine</z:chebi> markedly increased the reflex <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> in rats with IA-cath </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The reflex decrease in HR caused by methoxamine was not potentiated by <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46631">clonidine</z:chebi> in rats with either CA-cath or IA-cath with the CA clamped or following chemical denervation of the carotid sinus area with <z:chebi fb="43" ids="15882">phenol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that while unilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> does not alter the reflex response to elevations in AP, it significantly interferes with <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46631">clonidine</z:chebi>'s ability to potentiate baroreceptor responses </plain></SENT>
