<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A new in vivo model for studying brain metabolic and haemodynamic oscillatory phenomena during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> is described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this model <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> occlusion of one or two carotid arteries in the rat is performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Due to the partial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> developed, oscillations in the level of intramitochondrial <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36980">pyridine nucleotides</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16908">NADH</z:chebi>) as well as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5086">flavoproteins</z:chebi> (Fp) were recorded from the brain by monitoring the fluorescence of these respiratory chain components </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The two fluorescent signals (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16908">NADH</z:chebi> and Fp) were measured by using the time sharing or DC fluorometer/reflectometer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The changes in the reflected light at the excitation wavelengths (366 and 450 nm) were recorded simultaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> induced immediate oscillations (6-9 waves per min) in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> redox state as well as in tissue blood volume in both hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To verify the accuracy of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16908">NADH</z:chebi> monitoring system, including the correction technique for haemodynamic and other artifacts, we used the intracarotid artery saline bolus injection approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results could be summarized as follows: (1) unilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> resulted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>delayed development</z:hpo> of oscillations, particularly in the ipsilateral hemisphere; (2) the oscillation phenomenon was reversible if recirculation restarted within 5 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Occlusion for more than 30 min resulted in irreversible oscillations; (3) the oscillation appearances and intensities were affected by various physiological conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Vasoconstriction, induced by <z:mp ids='MP_0002319'>hyperoxia</z:mp>, stimulated the oscillations while vasodilation, induced by <z:mp ids='MP_0002318'>hypercapnia</z:mp>, depressed them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002316'>Anoxia</z:mp>, <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> and spreading <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> (SD) abolished the oscillations </plain></SENT>
