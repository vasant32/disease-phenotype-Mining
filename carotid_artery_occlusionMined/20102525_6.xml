<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The number of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi>-positive neurons in the hippocampal CA1 sector was significantly smaller in TFAM-Tg mice than in WT mice (P = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The percentage of viable neurons in the hippocampal CA1 sector was significantly higher in TFAM-Tg mice than in WT mice (P &lt; 0.001), and the number of TUNEL-positive neurons was significantly smaller in TFAM-Tg mice than in WT mice (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our data strongly suggest that TFAM overexpression can reduce <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> permeability transition and ameliorate delayed neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in the hippocampus after transient forebrain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
