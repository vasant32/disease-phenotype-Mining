<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD AND RESULTS: Carotid endarterectomy was performed without a shunt in 654 consecutive patients: group 1, 513 patients with contralateral stenosis of less than 79%: group 11, 74 patients with a greater than 80% contralateral stenosis; and group 111, 67 patients with a contralateral occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Average cross-clamp time was 23 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neurological complications occurred within 30 days in 20 (3.0%) patients (10 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, seven <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> in group I, one <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> in group II, and one <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and one <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> in group III) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immediate postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, i.e. those five cases that could be implicated as caused by lack of a shunt, were rare (0.76%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were five perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (0.76%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Carotid endarterectomy may be performed safely without a shunt even in the presence of a contralateral occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Age, sex, preoperative indication, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38867">anesthetic agent</z:chebi> and contralateral stenosis were not associated with an increased risk of postoperative neurological deficit </plain></SENT>
