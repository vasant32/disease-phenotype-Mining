<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> limitations of oxygen supply were induced in Wistar rats by 2 weeks of permanent bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (2-vo) to initiate a 'preconditioning-like' effect that protects rat brain energy metabolism against further <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> (15 min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Haemodynamic parameters, arterial blood gases and body temperature were monitored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Energy metabolites were determined in rat parietotemporal cerebral cortex: <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> 5'-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15266,18036">triphosphate</z:chebi> (ATP), <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> 5'-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="18361">diphosphate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>), <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> 5'-monophosphate (<z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi>), phosphocreatine (PCr), and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> by the high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) technique and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> spectrophotometrically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 2 weeks, permanent 2-vo led to a significant decrease in the concentrations of cortical tissue ATP and PCr, from 3.06+/-0.48 to 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>09+/-0.28 and from 4.27+/-0.63 to 3.35+/-0.41 micromol/g, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These changes were associated with a two-fold increase in <z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> alone (non-preconditioning) reduced ATP and PCr drastically, to 0.97+/-0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>51 and 1.76+/-1.23 micromol/g </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Tissue concentrations of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> were markedly increased, three- to five-fold, in 'non-preconditioned' brain tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast, after 2 weeks of 2-vo <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> did not significantly alter the cortical energy state any further </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The effects of preconditioning on tissue ATP and PCr were most pronounced at 5 min and 48 h after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, permanent 2-vo seems to activate compensatory mechanisms, which effectively protect the rat's cortical energy metabolism against an additional ischaemic attack ('preconditioning-like' effect) </plain></SENT>
