<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twelve dogs were placed under general inhalation anesthesia and mechanically ventilated to maintain normocapnea and an end-tidal <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi> concentration equivalent to 1.3 times the minimum alveolar concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Tourniquets were placed around both carotid arteries of each dog </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both lingual arteries were cannulated in each dog and their heart rate and blood pressure were measured bilaterally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During unilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, the blood pressures in the ipsilateral lingual artery were significantly (P &lt; 0.05) lower than the preocclusion control pressures and pressures recorded in the contralateral vessel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> resulted in a further significant (P &lt; 0.05) fall in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> lingual arterial pressures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The recorded heart rates only varied significantly from preocclusion control values when they increased during bilateral carotid occlusion (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results of this study confirm that carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> has the potential to reduce intraoperative blood loss during oronasal surgery in the dog </plain></SENT>
