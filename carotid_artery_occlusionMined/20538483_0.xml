<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were assigned to the carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (CO) group or the other (non-CO) group according to US findings before or immediately after receiving IV alteplase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Effectiveness and safety outcomes included early neurologic improvement, defined as a reduction in a National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) score of ≥4 points within the initial 24 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>; completely independent routine activity, defined as a modified Rankin Scale score of ≤1 at day 90 after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>; symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e>) occurring within 36 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>; and any <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We enrolled 127 patients (27 in the CO group and 100 in the non-CO group) with a median baseline NIHSS score of 13 (range, 4-30) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The CO group had a higher baseline NIHSS score (median, 18 vs 12; P=.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After multivariate adjustment, the CO group was inversely associated with early improvement (odds ratio [OR]=0.26; 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.09-0.72) and independence at day 90 (OR=0.23; 95% CI=0.05-0.73) and positively associated with any <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> (OR=3.11; 95% CI=1.23-8.48) </plain></SENT>
