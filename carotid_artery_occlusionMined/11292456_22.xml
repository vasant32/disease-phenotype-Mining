<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BCAO preferentially injured white matter in the corpus callosum, subcortex and internal capsule areas while largely spared cortical neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>White matter rarefaction in the corpus callosum was observed in 12 out of the 17 BCAO rat brains and significantly <z:hpo ids='HP_0006956'>enlarged lateral ventricles</z:hpo> were found in five out of seven P14 BCAO rat brains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These white matter changes were similar to injuries found in newborn infants with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006970'>periventricular leukomalacia</z:hpo> (PVL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>White matter injuries in the 7-day-old BCAO rat brain were accompanied with increased activation of microglia/macrophages, as indicated by ED1 and OX42 positive immunostaining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immature oligodendrocytes in the 7-day-old BCAO rat brain, as indicated by O4+/O1+ staining, were much fewer than in the sham-operated rat brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunostaining for myelin basic protein (MBP) at the fimbria hippocampus and the internal capsule areas in the 7-day-old BACO rat brain was also much less than in the control rat brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Consistent with the immunostaining data, MBP <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression in the 7-day-old, but not in the 14-day-old, BCAO rat brain was significantly less than in the control rat brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The overall results suggest that pre-oligodendrocytes and immature oligodendrocytes might be major targets for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> ischemic insults and activated microglia/macrophages are possibly involved in the process of white matter injury </plain></SENT>
