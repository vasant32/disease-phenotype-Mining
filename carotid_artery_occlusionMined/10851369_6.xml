<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether in selected patients with internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion and initially <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) measured with PET, subsequent changes of cerebral hemodynamics and metabolism occur during long-term follow-up and, if so, whether the changes are associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0007371'>atrophy of the corpus callosum</z:hpo> or subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The course of the changes in cerebral hemodynamics and metabolism after ICA occlusion remain unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After ICA occlusion, an increase in OEF may increase the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, and an increase in cortical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> would cause progression of callosal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors used PET and MRI to examine twice seven medically treated patients with unilateral ICA occlusion and initially <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> OEF at intervals ranging from 24 to 64 (mean +/- SD, 42 +/- 17) months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No intervening ischemic attacks occurred between the two examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the hemisphere with ICA occlusion, OEF increased and blood flow decreased during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At the follow-up evaluation, abnormally increased OEF values were found in three patients, in whom ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo> occurred during subsequent follow-up (18 +/- 6 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A decrease in oxygen metabolism also occurred and was significantly correlated with the decrease of callosal size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary findings in a small, selected patient sample suggest that in patients with ICA occlusion and initially <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> OEF, deteriorations of cerebral hemodynamics and metabolism during long-term follow-up may be associated with callosal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> or subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
