<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The source of the neurotoxin <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16675">quinolinic acid</z:chebi> (QUIN) in brain and systemic tissues under <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and pathologic circumstances reflects either de novo synthesis from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16828,29954">L-tryptophan</z:chebi> and other precursors, or entry of QUIN itself from the blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To quantify the relative contributions of blood- versus tissue-derived QUIN, [13C7]-QUIN was infused subcutaneously via osmotic pumps (0.55 microliter/h, 30 mM) in gerbils, and the fraction of QUIN in tissue (Tl; measured in tissue homogenates) derived from blood (Bl; measured in serum) was calculated by the formula ([13C7]QUINTi/QUINTi)/([13C7]QUINBl/ QUINBl) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In controls, blood QUIN contributed 38-49% of QUIN in brain, 70% in CSF, between 40 and 70% in kidney, heart, and skeletal muscle, but &lt; 5% in spleen, lung, liver, and intestine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Systemic endotoxin (450 micrograms/kg) increased blood, brain, CSF, and systemic tissue QUIN levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Notably, the relative proportion of QUIN derived from blood in brain, spleen, lung, and intestine was unchanged by endotoxin, but increased in kidney, heart, and skeletal muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, cerebral ischemic injury (10 min of bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>) increased regional brain QUIN concentrations at 4 days post <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, with a proportional increase in the amount of QUIN derived from de novo synthesis by brain tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the blood and systemic tissues of postischemic gerbils, there were no changes in systemic tissue or blood QUIN levels, or changes in the relative proportions of blood- versus systemic tissue-derived QUIN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results establish that the brain normally synthesizes QUIN, that the blood is a significant source of QUIN in controls and during <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> systemic immune activation, and that the rate of QUIN formation by brain tissue increases in conditions of brain and systemic immune activation </plain></SENT>
