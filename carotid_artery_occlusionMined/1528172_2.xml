<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To investigate how the expression of PKC is affected in postischemic brain, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was produced in gerbils by bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> for 10 min followed by reperfusion for 15 min, 6 h, and 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The brains of postischemic and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control animals were removed, forebrains dissected, fresh frozen, and processed for in situ hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of PKC was analyzed by using oligonucleotide probes based on the sequences of PKC alpha and epsilon isozymes in this preliminary study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no change observed in the expression of PKC alpha in any region of the brain in any of the postischemic groups examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was, however, a qualitative increase in the transcription for PKC epsilon in two out of three brains of 15 min postischemic group which continued through 24 h of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Since the protein itself was not examined, it can not be said how these observations regarding transcription relate to the synthesis of the protein and whether there are any changes in the subcellular distribution of PKC following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, since there was no decrease in transcription demonstrated in our study, it appears that the reported decrease in PKC activity following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> is not due to decreased <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression </plain></SENT>
