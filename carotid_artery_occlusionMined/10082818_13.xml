<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In two sequential protocols forty rats were physiologically monitored and controlled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In protocol 1, rats were randomized (n=10/group) to 30 min of control (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17045,29796">N2O</z:chebi> plus 0.4% <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi>), low dose fentanyl (loading dose [LD] 50 micrograms kg-1, maintenance dose [MD] 2 micrograms kg-1 min-1), or high-dose fentanyl (LD 800 micrograms kg-1, MD 32 micrograms kg-1 min-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After 15 min of fentanyl or sham infusion trimethaphan 0.5 mg was given i.v. and 3 min later bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and blood withdrawal-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> were maintained for 12 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At 18 h postischemia rats underwent cerebral perfusion fixation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Brain areas were graded from 0 (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>) to 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition to analysis of specific regions, neuropathologic scores were also summated over <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> brain regions and analyzed to compute a summed neuropathologic score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In protocol 2, five control and five high-dose fentanyl rats were treated identically except that post-ischemic oxygenation was maintained for 6 h and cerebral perfusion-fixation was performed 6 h post-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only the caudate/putamen was examined in protocol 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Fentanyl worsened lesions in both fentanyl groups' summed neuropathologic scores (P=0.002) in protocol 1 and specifically, in the caudate/putamen (P&lt;0.01) in both protocols </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Fentanyl in both high and low doses can exacerbate incomplete forebrain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in rats </plain></SENT>
