<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In this study, cerebral blood flow, oxygenation, metabolic, and electrical functional responses to forepaw stimulation were monitored in rats at different levels of global <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> from mild to severe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Laser speckle contrast imaging and optical imaging of intrinsic signals were used to measure changes in blood flow and oxygenation, respectively, along with a compartmental model to calculate changes in oxygen metabolism from these measured changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To characterize the electrical response to functional stimulation, we measured somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Global graded <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was induced through unilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, bilateral carotid and right subclavian artery (SCA) occlusion, or carotid and SCA occlusion with negative lower body pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We found that the amplitude of the functional metabolic response remained tightly coupled to the amplitude of the SEP at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> levels of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, as the level of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> became more severe, the flow response was more strongly attenuated than the electrical response, suggesting that global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was associated with an uncoupling between the functional flow and electrical responses </plain></SENT>
