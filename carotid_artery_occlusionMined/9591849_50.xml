<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the variability of intracranial vasculature at the circle of Willis in mice can influence the degree of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in both the bilateral common carotid artery (CCA) occlusion and intraluminal suture occlusion models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have developed a method to predict the extent of the anastomosis between carotid and vertebrobasilar circulation in three mouse strains (C57BL/6, CBA, and <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi>/2) by measuring cortical microperfusion with laser Doppler flowmetry during a 1-minute occlusion of both CCA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When animals showed residual cortical microperfusion of less than 12% during bilateral CCA occlusion, the mice showed absence of functional anastomosis, developed ATP <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> in the frontal cortex during occlusion, and had ischemic neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in the hippocampus and caudoputamen after occlusion for 15 minutes and recirculation for 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, those mice exhibited decreased local cerebral blood flow and associated ischemic neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in the hippocampus, within the territory supplied by the posterior cerebral artery, with the intraluminal suture occlusion model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The current study demonstrates the need for assessment of intracranial vasculature in each animal by measuring cortical microperfusion during temporary occlusion of both CCA, no matter whether <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> is produced by bilateral CCA occlusion or intraluminal suture occlusion in transgenic mice </plain></SENT>
