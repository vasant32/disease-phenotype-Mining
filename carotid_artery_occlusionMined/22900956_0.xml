<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> treated by thrombectomy with the Merci Retriever and identified the presence of device fracture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The predictors of device fracture were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the impact of device fracture on <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> and clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 136 patients treated by thrombectomy, 6 (4.4%) experienced intraprocedural Merci device fracture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was associated with device fracture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The fractured X and L series Merci Retrievers were successfully ensnared in four patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with fractured devices had similar rates of successful revascularization with those without </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In patients with fractured devices, no parenchymal <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematomas</z:mp> were found, while hemorrhagic infarction and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> were found in three and two patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with fractured devices tended to be more dependent (modified Rankin Scale â‰¥ 3) at discharge, but had similar rates of in-hospital mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Merci device fracture is relatively infrequent in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> treated with thrombectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This complication may not increase the risk of parenchymal <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> but tends to be associated with poor outcome </plain></SENT>
