<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present two patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> of similar anatomic position with an extracranial component in the infratemporal fossa and parapharyngeal space, an isthmus at the foramen ovale, and a superior component in the middle cranial fossa in the region of the cavernous sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A 15-year-old girl experienced contiguous spread of a spindle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo>; an 18-year-old boy developed a <z:hpo ids='HP_0006765'>chondrosarcoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A middle fossa approach provided the advantage of surgical avoidance of structures such as the middle ear and mastoid, facial nerve, and mandible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Postoperative recovery was rapid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our impression is that preoperative carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and a middle fossa approach for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> resection can be performed in a young patient with acceptable morbidity and at least short-term benefit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Surgery can, therefore, provide an additional therapeutic approach to complement irradiation and chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
