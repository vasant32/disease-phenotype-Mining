<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Venous blood from five clinically affected gerbils contained more aggregated platelets (37.8% +/- 6.4) than did blood from eight unaffected animals (11.1% +/- 3.0; p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Platelets labeled with 3H-<z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> were increased in ischemic brain; the ratio of radioactivity in the ipsilateral versus contralateral hemisphere was greater in eight affected (1.09 +/- 0.03) than in 19 unaffected (1.00 +/- 0.01; p less than 0.02) animals </plain></SENT>
