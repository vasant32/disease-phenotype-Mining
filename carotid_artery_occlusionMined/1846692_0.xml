<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Noninvasive imaging of the carotid bifurcation with colour-coded Doppler sonography demonstrated patency of the external and internal carotid arteries distal to a common carotid occlusion in 4 patients which could be proven surgically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Identification of internal carotid artery patency could be demonstrated by angiography in two of the patients while in the other two cases angiography was inconclusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, CCDS provided a correct diagnosis of the internal carotid patency in these patients with common carotid occlusion </plain></SENT>
