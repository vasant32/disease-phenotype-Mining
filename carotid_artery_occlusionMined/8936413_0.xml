<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PDH activity and energy metabolites (ATP, PCr, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi>) were measured in the caudate nucleus and cortex at each time period </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>ATP and PCr concentrations were significantly depleted after the ischemic insult, returning to 60-80% of the control level after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
