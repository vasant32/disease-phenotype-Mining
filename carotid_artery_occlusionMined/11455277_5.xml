<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (OPCABG) has assumed an increasing role in many surgical practices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The ideal candidate has not been defined, but high-risk patients seem to benefit most when cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), aortic cross clamping and cardioplegic arrest are avoided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fourteen high-risk patients (age 52 to 81 years, 1 female, EF 44%+/-8, Parsonnet score 23+/-4) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> coronary syndroms on platelet <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> IIb/IIIa <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, worsening <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo>, decompensating ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo>, religious beliefs and denial of blood transfusion, and severe peripheral/cerebrovascular disease (total bilateral internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and/or &gt;90% stenosis) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These patients underwent OPCABG via sternotomy with the intention of complete coronary revascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: An average of 2.3 grafts/patient were performed and the posterior descending artery (<z:mp ids='MP_0003139'>PDA</z:mp>) and marginal branches of the circumflex artery (LCX) were grafted in 79% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were 3 events of intraoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> precipitated by occlusion of right coronary artery (RCA) or positioning a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001640'>cardiomegaly</z:hpo> heart leading to immediate intravascular shunting (2) and/or conversion to CPB (1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One patient was converted to CPB and graft revision (intraoperative ultrasound and probing) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mortality rate was 0% and one <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was observed on post-operative day 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Coronary angiography (n=6) showed no significant stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: OPCABG complete revascularization is feasible in high-risk patients with low morbidity and mortality and excellent early RESULTS: OPCABG may be indicated in patients on platelet receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> preventing <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001640'>Cardiomegaly</z:hpo> can cause difficult off-pump LCX and <z:mp ids='MP_0003139'>PDA</z:mp> exposure and stabilization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>RCA grafting off-pump is less tolerated and <z:mp ids='MP_0003139'>PDA</z:mp> grafting is preferred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>High-risk patients for CPB are the ones who may benefit the most from OPCABG </plain></SENT>
