<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We tested the hypothesis that inhibition of leukocyte function by administration of monoclonal antibody 60.3 (MoAb 60.3) improves electrophysiological recovery and decreases injury volume following transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in cats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">Halothane</z:chebi>-anesthetized cats underwent 90 minutes of left middle cerebral artery and bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> followed by 180 minutes of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cats were assigned to receive either 2 mg/kg MoAb 60.3 (n = 8) directed at the CDw18 leukocyte antigen complex or an equal volume of diluent (<z:mp ids='MP_0001924'>sterile</z:mp> saline; n = 10) at 45 minutes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in a blinded fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Blood flow to the left temporoparietal cortex decreased to less than 5 ml/min/100 g with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, but was minimally affected on the right side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Postischemic hyperemia occurred in the left caudate nucleus, whereas blood flow in other brain regions returned to control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No region demonstrated delayed hypoperfusion, and there were no differences between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Somatosensory evoked potential recorded over the left cortex was ablated during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and recovered to less than 10% of baseline amplitude at 180 minutes of reperfusion in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Left hemispheric injury volume, as assessed by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> staining, was not affected by drug treatment (mean +/- SE values: MoAb 60.3, 37 +/- 5%; placebo, 38 +/- 7% of hemisphere) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Inhibition of leukocyte function with MoAb 60.3 does not afford protection from severe focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and reperfusion in cats </plain></SENT>
