<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Patients with internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion can demonstrate impaired cerebral vascular reserve (CVR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The detection of CVR using single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission CT (SPECT) is nowadays widely accepted as a predictor in the diagnostic pathway in patients considered for cerebral revascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently perfusion CT (PCT) gained widely acceptance in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The present study was aimed at comparing the results of perfusion CT (PCT) and 99m Tc-HMPAO SPECT with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> challenge in patients with ICA occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 13 patients were included in the prospective evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both PCT and 99m Tc-HMPAO SPECT were performed before and after the administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In detail, regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), regional cerebral blood volume (rCBV), adapted time to peak (Tmax) and mean transit times (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi>) were compared with SPECT data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>- RESULTS: 99m Tc-HMPAO SPECT demonstrated an impairment of CVR in six patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A preserved CVR was present in seven patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with impaired CVR proven by SPECT had a delayed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> (mean +2.98 s) and a delayed Tmax (mean + 5.9 s), (both p &lt;0.005 compared with the non occluded side) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>66% of patients with impaired CVR in SPECT showed a complete correlation of Tmax measurements in PCT with a high positive predictive value (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53261">PPV</z:chebi>: 88.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>- CONCLUSION: The prospective study demonstrated a highly significant correlation of perfusion parameters as detected by 99m Tc-HMPAO SPECT and the Tmax as detected by PCT in patients with ICA occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Therefore this easy-to-perform technique seems to be an adequate method for the evaluation of cerebral perfusion in patients with ICA occlusion </plain></SENT>
