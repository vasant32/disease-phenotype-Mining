<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The aim of the present study was to assess hemodynamic variations in symptomatic unilateral internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (ICAO) patients with primary collateral flow via circle of Willis or secondary collateral flow via ophthalmic artery and/or leptomeningeal collaterals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-eight patients with a symptomatic unilateral ICAO were enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Based on digital subtraction angiography (DSA) findings, patients were classified into 2 groups: primary collateral (n = 14) and secondary collateral (n = 24) groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Collateral flow hemodynamics were investigated with perfusion computed tomography (PCT) by measuring the cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume (CBV) and time to peak (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi>) in the hemispheres ipsilateral and contralateral to ICAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Based on the measurements, the ipsilateral to contralateral ratio for each parameter was calculated and compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Irrespective of the collateral patterns, ipsilateral CBF was not significantly different from that of the contralateral hemisphere (P = 0.285); ipsilateral CBV and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> was significantly increased compared with those of the contralateral hemisphere (P=0.000 and P = 0.000 for CBV and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi>, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, patients with secondary collaterals had significantly larger ipsilateral-to-contralateral ratios for both CBV (rCBV, P = 0.0197) and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> (rTTP, P = 0.000) than those of patients with only primary collaterals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These two groups showed no difference in ipsilateral-to-contralateral ratio for CBF (rCBF, P = 0.312) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patients with symptomatic unilateral ICAO in our study were in an autoregulatory vasodilatation status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, secondary collaterals in ICAO patients were correlated with ipsilateral CBV and delayed <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> that suggested severe hemodynamic impairment, presumably increasing the risk of ischemic events </plain></SENT>
