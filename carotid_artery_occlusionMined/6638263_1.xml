<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that it may also be possible to distinguish <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> occlusion by real-time ultrasonography, although further evaluation is necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Additional clinically important information about the ipsilateral external carotid artery and the contralateral internal carotid artery is also obtained with this combination of noninvasive studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Finally, although internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> remains a therapeutic challenge to the clinician, its noninvasive diagnosis may be of great help in planning early therapy and in determining arteriographic needs </plain></SENT>
