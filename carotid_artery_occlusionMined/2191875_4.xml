<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Doppler ultrasound examination was performed in 59 patients who were still alive and living within 100 miles of the hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using lifetable analysis, the annual rate of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> was estimated to be 2% and 1.5% on the operated and the contralateral, non-operated carotid artery, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Doppler examination revealed 48% re-stenoses, including 14% occlusion and 15% greater than 50% stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, there was no association between the occurrence of restenosis and the development of symptoms, perhaps with the exception of internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, which is not an accepted indication for carotid endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Together with recent data from the literature, these observations challenge the indication for reoperative carotid surgery </plain></SENT>
