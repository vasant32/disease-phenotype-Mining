<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed at describing molecular changes during the first 48 h after exposure of the neonatal rat brain to HI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twelve-day-old rats were subjected to unilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and 90 min of 8% O2, leading to neuronal damage in the ipsilateral hemisphere only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Phosphorylated-Akt levels were decreased from 0.5 to 6 h post-HI, whereas the level of phosphorylated extracellular signal-related kinases (ERK)1/2 increased during this time frame </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>Hypoxia</z:mp>-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha protein increased with a peak at 3 h after HI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression for IL-beta and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha and -beta started to increase at 6 h with a peak at 24 h post-HI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Expression of heat shock protein 70 was increased from 12 h after HI onwards in the ipsilateral hemisphere only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, HI changed the expression of cytokines, HIF1-alpha ,and P-Akt to the same extent in both the ipsi- as well as the contralateral hemisphere, although neuronal damage was unilateral </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Exposure of animals to <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> without carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> induced similar changes in cytokines, HIF-1alpha, and P-Akt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that during HI, <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> is sufficient to regulate multiple molecular mediators that may contribute, but are not sufficient, to induce long-term neuronal damage </plain></SENT>
