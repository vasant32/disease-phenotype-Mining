<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study was approved by the institutional review boards and performed according to HIPPA standards </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five patients were treated with 27 carotid artery stent-grafts (Gore Viabahn, n = 10; Bard Fluency, n = 9; <z:chebi fb="3" ids="53251">polytetrafluoroethylene</z:chebi>-covered Palmaz, n = 5; and Wallgraft, n = 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirteen stent-grafts were placed in patients with carotid blow-out syndrome (including three patients with carotid-airway <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath>), 12 in patients with either pseudoaneurysm (n = 9) or true <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> (n = 3), and two in patients with intractable high-grade bare stent restenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The technical success rate was 100% (27 of 27 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> procedural <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Procedural dissections occurred in two of the 27 cases (7.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Short-term complications occurred in three of the 27 cases (11%) (repeat <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, n = 2; common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The overall patient mortality rate was 36% (nine of 25 patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> with carotid blow-out syndrome) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Six-month follow-up in 15 of the 16 living patients demonstrated widely patent stent-grafts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two patients with pseudoaneurysm also demonstrated patent stents at 18- and 33-month follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Stent-grafts may be useful in the treatment of carotid artery <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> syndrome, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, and stenosis, with a high procedural success rate in selected cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The results of mid-term follow-up are encouraging, but results of long-term follow-up must be evaluated in future studies </plain></SENT>
