<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The hospital's commission on scientific research on human subjects approved the study protocol, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> study subjects gave informed consent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the middle cerebral artery territories was calculated from the combined signal intensities measured with ASL at the multiple inversion times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the patients with ICA occlusion, mean CBF values were decreased in the gray matter of the hemisphere ipsilateral to the occlusion, as compared with values in the gray matter of the contralateral hemisphere (P &lt; .05) and with values in the gray matter of the control subjects (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Quantification of CBF with ASL at multiple inversion times can compensate for the blood transit delays in patients with ICA occlusion </plain></SENT>
