<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ten patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0100576'>amaurosis fugax</z:hpo>, 9 had hemispheric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, and 2 were asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With the exception of one patient, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had ipsilateral internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and either external <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> or a cul-de-sac of the occluded internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Six patients had ipsilateral common carotid occlusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The operative technique has been presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no operative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> or new neurologic deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were relieved of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients were followed a mean of 32 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During follow-up, 3 ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> occurred during the first 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Four <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> occurred (one ipsilateral and three contralateral) from 4 to 33 months postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate by life table analysis was 1 percent per year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that external carotid artery reconstruction is a safe, effective, and durable therapeutic alternative for management of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and an ipsilateral occluded internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>External carotid endarterectomy eliminates a potential source of emboli and increases cerebral perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Because of the increase in cerebral blood flow, subsequent extracranial-to-intracranial bypass may be unnecessary </plain></SENT>
