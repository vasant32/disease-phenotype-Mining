<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirty four occlusions of the internal carotid artery were found in 32 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These patients were prospectively evaluated, including clinical examination, analysis of risk factors and subsequent management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This group of patients was followed up for a mean period of 18 months, and the clinical and laboratory findings and follow up data of this group were compared to an age and sex matched group of patients with matched presenting symptoms, but with patent internal carotid arteries on angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four clinical patterns emerged in the patients with occluded carotid arteries; asymptomatic (3), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>'s (17), initial fixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (7), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> with subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Follow up of the occluded group revealed 19 patients (59%) with no further symptoms and no indication for surgical intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nine patients required surgery; 4 external carotid endarterectomies (ipsilateral), 4 internal carotid endarterectomies (contralateral), and one extracranial to intracranial bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two were lost to follow up and one died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After 18 months mean follow up 29 patients (91%) were well and asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Follow up for a similar period of the non-occluded group revealed three <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, three late <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> and three <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarctions</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>None were lost to follow up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>After 19 months mean follow up 26 patients (81%) were well with no new neurological symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The prognosis of appropriately treated patients with total occlusion of the internal carotid artery does not appear to be worse than in patients with similar presenting features and patent carotid arteries.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
