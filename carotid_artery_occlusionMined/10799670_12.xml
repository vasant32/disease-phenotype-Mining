<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The ischemic insults lasted for 10, 15 and 20 min without recirculation, and with several reperfusion intervals from 1 h to 3 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The resting and activated microglial cells were visualized with immunohistochemistry using monoclonal antibodies raised against the CR3 complement receptor, the MHC class I and class II antigens, the macrophage common antigen and with Bandeiiraea simplicifolia lectin-histochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The neuroprotective effect of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> on the early microglial activation was also studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ten minutes bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in hypothermic rats without reperfusion caused a mild microglial reaction in the hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Strong reaction was seen following 20 min insult without reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Ischemia</z:e> followed by recirculation caused milder reaction than without reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that the microglial cells are very sensitive indicators of a mild, transient ischemic insult that does not result in neuronal cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
