<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>Oxidative stress</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> are important pathophysiological mechanisms involved in post-ischemic cerebral injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study was designed to investigate the potential protective effect of diphenyl <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47026">diselenide</z:chebi> (PhSe)(2), an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25712">organoselenium compound</z:chebi> with <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> and anti-inflammatory properties, against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion (I/R) insult in rat brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The experimental model adopted was that of surgically-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e>, performed by means of bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The effect of a single oral dose of (PhSe)(2) (50 mg/kg), administered 30 min before the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, was investigated by assessing cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>-related biochemical parameters and pro-inflammatory cytokines in plasma of rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results demonstrated an increase in the levels of malondialdehyde (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>), reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitrate/<z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> as well as the alteration in the non-enzymatic and enzymatic (catalase and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase) <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> defense system induced by I/R insult in rat brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>I/R insult increased the levels of IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α and INF-γ in plasma of rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The administration of (PhSe)(2) restored cerebral levels of <z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>, ROS, nitrate/<z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> defenses of rats exposed to I/R insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>(PhSe)(2) markedly reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines in plasma of I/R rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>I/R insult increased the plasma levels of tissue damage markers, such as <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> kinase and α-1-acid <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This study showed for the first time the in vivo protective effect of (PhSe)(2) against <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and pro-inflammatory cytokines-induced by I/R insult in rats </plain></SENT>
