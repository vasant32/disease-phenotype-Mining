<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The external carotid artery (ECA) anastomoses in many distal territories supplied by the internal carotid artery (ICA) and is an important source of collateral circulation to the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Stenosis of the ECA in ipsilateral ICA occlusion can produce ischemic sequelae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To examine the effectiveness of ECA stenting in treating symptomatic ipsilateral ICA occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed patient databases from 5 academic medical centers to identify <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> individuals who underwent ECA stenting after 1998 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> discovered cases, coinvestigators used a common submission form to harvest relevant demographic information, clinical data, procedural details, and follow-up results for further analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twelve patients (median age, 66 years; range, 45-79 years) were identified for our cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Vessel disease involvement included severe ECA stenosis &gt;or= 70% in 11 patients and ipsilateral ICA occlusion in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Presenting symptoms included signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100576'>amaurosis fugax</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ECA stenting was associated with preservation of neurological status in 11 patients and resolution of symptoms in 5 patients at a median follow-up time of 26 months (range, 1-87 months; mean, 29 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic in-stent restenosis did not occur within any patient during the follow-up course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We found ECA stenting in symptomatic ipsilateral ICA disease to be a potentially effective strategy to preserve neurological function and to relieve ischemic symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further investigation with larger studies and longer follow-up periods is warranted to elucidate the true indications of this management strategy </plain></SENT>
