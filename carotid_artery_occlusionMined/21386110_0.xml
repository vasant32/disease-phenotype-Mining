<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Arterial spin labelling (ASL) is an MRI technique for measuring perfusion at the brain tissue level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to investigate cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) at brain-tissue level in patients with an internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion by combining ASL-MRI with a vascular challenge, and determine whether the CVR varies within the perfusion territory of the brain-feeding arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixteen patients with a symptomatic ICA occlusion and 16 age-matched healthy control subjects underwent perfusion and perfusion-territory selective ASL-MRI before and after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CVR was assessed throughout the brain in the grey matter supplied by the unaffected asymptomatic ICA and the basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Cerebral blood flow increased (p&lt;0.01) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> perfusion territories after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> in the patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the tissue supplied by the unaffected contralateral ICA, CVR was lower in the tissue supplied by the unaffected contralateral ICA in the patients when compared with the controls (22.8 ± 16.1 vs 54.2 ± 13.1%; mean difference, -31.5%, 95% CI -42.1 to -20.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Within the perfusion territory of the unaffected ICA, the CVR was lower in the brain tissue on the side of the occluded ICA than on the side of the unaffected ICA (13.5 ± 20.4 vs 26.2 ± 16.0%; paired mean difference -12.5%, 95% CI -20.3 to -4.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: ASL-MRI can assess impaired cerebrovascular reactivity at the brain-tissue level in patients with a symptomatic ICA occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Assessment of CVR with ASL-MRI may help to identify the tissue most at risk for future <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and as such may guide medical treatment </plain></SENT>
