<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>53 patients with carotid artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> were examined by colour Doppler flow imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These results were compared with real time duplex sonography and continuous wave Doppler sonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 48 low degree stenoses (less than 50%) the B-mode showed 36 smooth and 12 ulcerated plaque surfaces </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 24 high degree stenoses (greater than 50%) 10 plaques were smooth and 14 ulcerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the low degree stenoses, which exhibited smooth surfaces in B-mode examination, colour flow Doppler showed nine additional cases with turbulences in the area of the stenotic site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This indicates that plaque ulcerations in low degree stenoses are underestimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, in nearly <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases with high degree stenoses marked turbulences could be demonstrated by colour Doppler flow imaging independent of the B-mode, showing regular or ulcerated plaque surfaces </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the duplex ultrasound diagnosed a carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in 11 cases, but the colour coded Doppler was able to assess a remaining blood flow in two out of these 11 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that the colour Doppler flow imaging as a noninvasive technique is an advantage in diagnosing plaque ulcerations and it is more precise in diagnosing carotid occlusions than duplex-sonography is </plain></SENT>
