<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Extracranial Doppler analysis showed occlusion without a recordable signal from the internal carotid artery at any level or stenosis with accelerated flow in the high cervical segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Transcranial Doppler findings demonstrated the hemodynamic consequences of the internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> or stenosis with collateral flow across the circle of Willis and also showed the dampened pulse wave of the middle cerebral artery ipsilateral to the dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In duplex sonography, the indirect signs indicating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751815" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">internal carotid artery dissection</z:e> were a patent carotid bifurcation and proximal internal carotid artery segment but with no or only a short systolic flow signal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Atherosclerotic wall changes were absent, an important finding that suggests nonatherosclerotic stenosis or occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Direct signs making the diagnosis likely were a tapering of the internal carotid artery lumen distal to the bulb, an irregular membrane crossing the vessel lumen, and the demonstration of a true lumen with flow and a false one without flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>While cerebral angiography is still considered the gold standard, ultrasound may become the primary modality for early diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Doppler and duplex examinations help to indicate angiography and are the methods of choice for follow-up investigations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>They clearly demonstrate spontaneous recanalization with normalization of carotid circulation or, in case of persistent occlusion, improvement of collateral blood supply </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Sequential examinations may prove helpful to determine the duration of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
