<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To investigate the role of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> formed extracellularly in vascular homeostasis, mice with a targeted deletion of the cd73/ecto-5'-nucleotidase were generated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Southern blot, RT-PCR, and Western blot analysis confirmed the constitutive knockout </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In vivo analysis of hemodynamic parameters revealed no significant differences in systolic blood pressure, ejection fraction, or cardiac output between strains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, basal coronary flow measured in the isolated perfused heart was significantly lower (-14%; P&lt;0.05) in the mutant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry revealed strong CD73 expression on the endothelium of conduit vessels in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (WT) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Time to carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> after <z:chebi fb="2" ids="30808">ferric chloride</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30808">FeCl3</z:chebi>) was significantly reduced by 20% in cd73-/- mice (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>Bleeding</z:mp> time after tail tip resection tended to be shorter in cd73-/- mice (-35%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In vivo platelet cAMP levels were 0.96+/-0.46 in WT versus 0.68+/-0.27 pmol/106 cells in cd73-/- mice (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Under in vitro conditions, platelet aggregation in response to <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi> (0.05 to 10 micromol/L) was undistinguishable between the two strains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the cremaster model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion, the increase in leukocyte attachment to endothelium was significantly higher in cd73-/- compared with WT littermates (WT 98% versus cd73-/- 245%; P&lt;0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The constitutive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> of monocytes in ex vivo-perfused carotid arteries of WT mice was negligible but significantly increased in arteries of cd73-/- mice (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus, our data provide the first evidence that <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi>, extracellularly formed by CD73, can modulate coronary vascular tone, inhibit platelet activation, and play an important role in leukocyte <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> to the vascular endothelium in vivo </plain></SENT>
