<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Systolic ophthalmic artery blood velocity was reduced ipsilateral to an internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (38.2 +/- 10.2 cm/sec) compared with the contralateral and control velocities (46.0 +/- 10.3 and 47.5 +/- 6.8 cm/sec, respectively; p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ophthalmic systolic pressure measured by oculopneumoplethysmography was 94.7 +/- 13.2 mm Hg ipsilateral to an internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> compared with 108.4 +/- 15.3 mm Hg on the contralateral side (p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transorbital and periorbital Doppler ultrasonography detected reversed ophthalmic artery blood flow ipsilateral to an internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in 44.0% and 40.0% of the patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Systolic middle cerebral artery blood velocity was 55.2 +/- 22.3 cm/sec ipsilateral to an internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> compared with 79.4 +/- 23.5 cm/sec on the contralateral side (p less than 0.05) and 101.2 +/- 18.9 cm/sec in the controls (p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Reversed ophthalmic artery blood flow was associated with a low middle cerebral artery blood velocity and lack of major intracerebral collaterals </plain></SENT>
