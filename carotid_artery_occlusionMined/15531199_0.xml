<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Our unit policy is to duplex on admission <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy to confirm patency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate whether this had led to avoidance of unnecessary carotid surgery in a significant number of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Over a 7-year period from January 1997 to December 2003, a total of 475 patients were scheduled for carotid endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of these, 439 patients subsequently underwent carotid endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These data were obtained from prospectively collected vascular departmental records and we also hand searched notes of the 36 cancelled patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were a total of 36 cancellations for various reasons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of these, 8 were clearly occluded on duplex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A further 16 were highly suspicious of occlusion on duplex and thus surgery was deferred and selective angiography was undertaken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of these 9 were confirmed to be occluded on angiogram and a further 4 had severe stenoses or virtual occlusion, 3 patients had a distal internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus a total of 24 patients had an occlusion either diagnosed directly on duplex or because of suspicion on duplex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Unnecessary carotid surgery was avoided in 24 of 475 (5%) of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study shows that a preoperative duplex on admission for surgery results in 1 of 20 patients avoiding unnecessary carotid surgery </plain></SENT>
