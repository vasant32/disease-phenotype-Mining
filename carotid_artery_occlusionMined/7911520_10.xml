<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The ability to predict tolerance to carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> is therefore of benefit when planning procedures in which the carotid artery is at risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A trial of carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> using an angiographic balloon during concurrent neurological examination or blood flow studies is an accepted method for testing tolerance, but it carries the risks of an angiogram and cannot be performed at the bedside </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) is a noninvasive modality that permits measurement of blood velocity in cerebral vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The immediate effects of carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> on middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) perfusion can be obtained by insonating this artery during manual carotid artery compression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To compare the TCD response to carotid artery compression with the data obtained with more formal testing, the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> of 22 patients was insonated during manual carotid artery compression and the results compared with the clinical tolerance to balloon occlusion in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients and to blood flow studied by single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computerized tomography before or during balloon occlusion in 14 of the 22 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Surgery was planned to treat giant unruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> in 17 cases, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1527390" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">intracranial tumors</z:e> in three, a carotid-cavernous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> in one, and a carotid artery injury in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients showed a reduction in TCD flow velocities by no more than 65%; of these, 14 (93%) clinically tolerated the balloon occlusion test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the seven patients showing a TCD flow velocity decrease of more than 65%, six (86%) developed a transient focal deficit during the occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the change in <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> velocity measured with TCD studies during manual carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> is a useful predictor of the clinical and blood flow responses to a trial of carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> with an angiographic balloon </plain></SENT>
