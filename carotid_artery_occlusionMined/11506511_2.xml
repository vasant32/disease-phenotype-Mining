<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To report a 6 year experience with carotid percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (CPTA) in a selected group of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHOD: We retrospectively reviewed our experience after performing 54 CPTAs, with (n=18) or without (n=36) stent deployment, over a period of 6 years from 1993 to 1999 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients, except one, suffered from focal hemispheric neurologic symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During the same time period 284 patients underwent carotid endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The selection of the 54 patients (16%) for CPTA was based on the carotid angiogram and the sole inclusion criterion for endovascular treatment was a short, concentric, and smooth stenosis of more than 70% without ulceration or severe calcification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients who had a patent internal carotid artery after the last control were invited for a clinical duplex examination and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> duplex examinations were carried out by a single experienced observer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Early outcome (&lt;30 days): CPTA was judged technically successful in 50 cases (93%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ten patients (18%) experienced a neurological event in relation to the procedure and one patient (2%) suffered a major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One stent occluded within 30 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>LATE OUTCOME: Forty-six patients (85%) entered the follow-up study after a median of 34 months (range 1-80 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Six patients (13%) had recurrent symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The colour-duplex examination (n=45) showed internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in 2 patients (5%), and restenosis (&gt;70%) in 10 patients (22%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We found no significant difference in the reoccurrence of neurological symptoms or the rate of restenosis between patients treated with and without stent (Log Rank 0.28, p=0,59) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>ICA was patent without restenosis in 60% after 48 months in patients treated with CPTA alone, and in 76% after 3 months in patients treated with a stent (N.S.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CPTA in a selected group of patients has a mortality and major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate comparable to that of carotid endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>However, the risk of transient neurological events was high, as well as the incidence of restenosis (&gt;70%) after 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>We still consider CPTA an experimental procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The indications for this treatment must be clarified if CPTA should be an alternative to surgery with a comparable neurological complication rate </plain></SENT>
