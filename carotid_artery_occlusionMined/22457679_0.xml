<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of a single-centre registry including 271 consecutive patients (69 ±9 years, 87% at high risk for surgery), in whom 308 procedures were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study included both symptomatic (≥ 50% carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp>) and asymptomatic (≥ 70% carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp>) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary endpoint was the rate of adverse events during follow-up (range 1-48 months), defined as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We treated 115 critical and 193 moderate stenoses and implanted 318 stents (56% with closed cell design) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Embolic protection systems were used in 296 cases (96%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The technical success rate was 98.2% in the critical stenoses group and 99% in the moderate group (NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During follow-up, the incidence of the primary endpoint was 12.9% (13 pts) in the critical stenoses group and 14.7% (25 pts) in the moderate stenoses group (estimated 3-year freedom from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was 0.844 vs. 0.812; log-rank test p = 0.983) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Left ventricular ejection fraction &lt; 40%, significant contralateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> or stenosis and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal insufficiency</z:hpo> were identified as significant predictors of the primary endpoint (p &lt; 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Carotid artery stenting with embolic protection systems in patients at high risk for carotid endarterectomy is safe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with initially moderate and critical stenoses have an identical mid-term prognosis with regard to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
