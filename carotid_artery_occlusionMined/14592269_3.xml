<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Idiopathic (primary) <z:hpo ids='HP_0100785'>insomnia</z:hpo> can be difficult to treat; only two prior cases responsive to opiate therapy have been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A case is now presented of severe, idiopathic, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011463'>childhood-onset</z:hpo>, familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0100785'>insomnia</z:hpo>, with increased libido, absence of psychopathology, tardive emergence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035258" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">restless legs syndrome (RLS)</z:e>, and selective response to opiate therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: A 39-year-old woman was referred in 1981 by her physician who had discovered 3 years earlier that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8497">propoxyphene</z:chebi> treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002076'>migraines</z:hpo> also controlled her <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100785'>insomnia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>She had experienced severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100785'>insomnia</z:hpo> since childhood, and during early adulthood the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100785'>insomnia</z:hpo> intensified, as she would sleep 0-3 h nightly and never napped </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Daily generalized motor <z:hpo ids='HP_0000711'>restlessness</z:hpo> resulted in her frequently walking around the house while feeling exhausted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The quality of her life was considerably compromised by her <z:hpo ids='HP_0100785'>insomnia</z:hpo>, motor <z:hpo ids='HP_0000711'>restlessness</z:hpo>, and by an increased libido that was present since puberty and that was only partially relieved by having sex repeatedly with her husband </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nightly opiate therapy for 19 years has controlled the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100785'>insomnia</z:hpo>, motor <z:hpo ids='HP_0000711'>restlessness</z:hpo>, and excessive libido without affecting her <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> libido </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0100785'>insomnia</z:hpo> had not responded to treatment with &gt;25 agents covering &gt;10 pharmacologic categories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During her first (unmedicated) polysomnographic (PSG) study in 1981, she slept 0 min while spending 436 min in bed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 1984, four consecutive PSG studies were conducted in a design that confirmed the efficacy of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8497">propoxyphene</z:chebi> therapy of her <z:hpo ids='HP_0100785'>insomnia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In 1990, an ambulatory PSG revealed two runs of EEG rhythmic paroxysmal activity arising from sleep and wakefulness, without clinical correlate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Neurologic history was negative for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, but positive for complete right carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and three <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>At age 55 years, typical RLS emerged that was controlled with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15765">levodopa</z:chebi> therapy, and a concurrent relapse of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100785'>insomnia</z:hpo> was controlled with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7852">oxycodone</z:chebi> replacing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8497">propoxyphene</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Nightly opiate therapy of severe idiopathic (primary) <z:hpo ids='HP_0100785'>insomnia</z:hpo> can remain effective during very long-term clinical follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Guidelines are provided for when to consider such an unusual treatment in other cases of severe, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100785'>insomnia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
