<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our goal was to examine the possibility that collaterals develop after unilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During temporary occlusion of both carotid arteries in nine ketamine-anesthetized male rats, mean +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e> blood flow in both parietal cortices was 23 +/- 4% of the preocclusion (control) blood flow (120 +/- 7 ml/min/100 g) measured by laser Doppler flowmetry (p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After permanent occlusion of one carotid artery for either 1-2 days (n = 10) or 6 weeks (n = 7), mean +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e> blood flow was 16 +/- 2% and 30 +/- 3% of control, respectively, during a temporary test occlusion of the other carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During the test occlusion, blood flow in the cortex ipsilateral to the 6-week occlusion was 170% that in the contralateral cortex (which was similar to the blood flow immediately after temporary occlusion of both carotid arteries) and twice that after 1-2 days of occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> diameter of the basilar-carotid anastomosis ipsilateral to the 6-week occlusion was 186% that of the contralateral anastomosis, which showed only minimal change, and 145% that after 1-2 days of occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that during 6 weeks of permanent carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> the anastomosis enlarges and its blood flow or reserve increases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, collaterals developed ipsilateral to, but not contralateral to, the 6-week carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, which suggests the possibility of greater collateral protection on the permanently occluded side </plain></SENT>
