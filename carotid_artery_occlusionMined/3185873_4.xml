<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one patients had internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, and 14 had middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Isovolemic hemodilution combined with venesection and the administration of fresh plasma to reduce the hematocrit (Hct) to 33% was performed within 72 hours of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Hct decreased by 27% and was correlated directly with whole blood viscosity (WBV) at a shear rate of 10 sec-1 after the hemodilution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cardiac output increased by 29% after hemodilution without significant alterations in cerebral perfusion pressure and showed a good inverse correlation with the Hct and the WBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The rCBF of the area supplied by the ischemic middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) increased by 30% and was related inversely to the Hct and the WBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebrospinal fluid pressure increased</z:e> by 16%, but no symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151740" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">raised intracranial pressure</z:e> were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The N20 peak latency of the sensory evoked potential decreased by 5%, and the neurological score was improved by 12% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Isovolemic hemodilution thus resulted in an increase of the rCBF in the area supplied by the affected <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>, leading to significant neurological improvement </plain></SENT>
