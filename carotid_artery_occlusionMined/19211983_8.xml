<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Occlusion of the bilateral carotid artery for 17 min, followed by reperfusion for 24 h, was employed to produce <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and reperfusion (I/R) induced cerebral injury in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size was measured by using triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Memory was assessed using the <z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water maze</z:mp> (MWM) test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Degree of motor <z:hpo ids='HP_0002311'>incoordination</z:hpo> was evaluated using the inclined beam walk test, rota-rod test, and lateral push test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="71" ids="17303">Morphine</z:chebi> (8 mg/kg, ip), an opioid <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="8" ids="3374">capsaicin</z:chebi> (0.1 mg/kg, iv), a CGRP releasing agent, were administered 24 h before surgery to separate groups of animals to induce pharmacological preconditioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, followed by reperfusion, produced a significant increase in the cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233794" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">impaired memory</z:e> as well as motor coordination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="71" ids="17303">Morphine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="8" ids="3374">capsaicin</z:chebi> treatment produced both a significant decrease in the cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and a reversal of I/R-induced impairment of memory and motor-coordination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="71" ids="17303">Morphine</z:chebi>-induced (8 mg/kg, ip) neuroprotective effects were completely decreased by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="10650">sumatriptan</z:chebi> (8 mg/kg, ip, a CGRPrelease inhibitor) administered 1 h before and 6 h and 12 h after <z:chebi fb="71" ids="17303">morphine</z:chebi> administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="8" ids="3374">Capsaicin</z:chebi>-induced neuroprotection was decreased by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7459">naloxone</z:chebi> (5 mg/kg, ip, an opioid <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>) administered 1 h before and 6 h and 12 h after <z:chebi fb="8" ids="3374">capsaicin</z:chebi> administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that the transduction systems mediating <z:chebi fb="71" ids="17303">morphine</z:chebi>- and <z:chebi fb="8" ids="3374">capsaicin</z:chebi>-induced pharmacological preconditioning in brain are possibly interlinked with one another </plain></SENT>
