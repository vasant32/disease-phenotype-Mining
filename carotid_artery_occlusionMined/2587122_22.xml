<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The 7-d postnatal rats received 2.5 muCi 2-DG subcutaneously, after which blood was collected for measurement of plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and 2-DG activity at intervals up to 90 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The brains of the 90-min rat pups either were frozen for analysis of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration and chromatographic separation of 2-DG and 2-DG-6-phosphate or for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36927">[14C]</z:chebi>-autoradiography </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36927">[14C]</z:chebi> activity in brain, 75.6% was in the 2-DG-6-phosphate fraction; this percent was substituted for K1*, K2*, and K3* in the Sokoloff equation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cerebral hemispheric CGU (n = 6) averaged 11.4 +/- 1.5 mumol/100 g/min, 1/10 the value of adult rat brain </plain></SENT>
