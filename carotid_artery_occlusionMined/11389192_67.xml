<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To identify kinases responsible for eIF2alpha phosphorylation [eIF2alpha(P)] during brain reperfusion, we induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> by bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> followed by post-ischemic assessment of brain eIF2alpha(P) in mice with homozygous functional knockouts in the genes encoding the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi>-regulated eIF2alpha kinase (HRI), or the amino acid-regulated eIF2alpha kinase (GCN2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A 10-fold increase in eIF2alpha(P) was observed in reperfused <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice and in the HRI-/- or GCN2-/- mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> reperfused groups, the <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>-dependent protein kinase (PKR)-like endoplasmic reticulum eIF2alpha kinase (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="17300">PERK</z:chebi>) exhibited an isoform mobility shift on <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi>-PAGE, consistent with the activation of the kinase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that neither HRI nor GCN2 are required for the large increase in post-ischemic brain eIF2alpha(P), and in conjunction with our previous report that eIF2alpha(P) is produced in the brain of reperfused PKR-/- mice, provides evidence that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17300">PERK</z:chebi> is the kinase responsible for eIF2alpha phosphorylation in the early post-ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
