<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Although it is well known that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">Lipoprotein</z:chebi>(a) (Lp(a)) is an atherogenic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> and an independent risk factor for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e>, there is no confirmed therapy to decrease Lp(a) or prevent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> induced by Lp(a) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus, it is mandatory to develop novel therapy to prevent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in high Lp(a) concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we focused on the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> on Lp(a) level and Lp(a)-induced vascular remodeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We employed Lp(a) transgenic mice (human apo(a) yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) and human apoB double transgenic mice) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Vascular remodeling was induced by ligation of the common carotid artery and the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> was evaluated in female mice after ovariectomy with or without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> replacement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">Estrogen</z:chebi> deficiency caused by ovariectomy increased serum Lp(a), and continuous replacement of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16469">17beta-estradiol</z:chebi> (20 microg/kg/day) reversed the change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the vascular remodeling model induced by carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, neointima formation was significantly increased in ovariectomized female Lp(a) transgenic mice, but few in male Lp(a) transgenic mice, as compared to wild FVB mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Importantly, continuous replacement of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> in ovariectomized mice significantly attenuated it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In cultured endothelial cells and macrophages, addition of Lp(a) increased <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, E-selectin and <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 in endothelial cells and TNF-alpha, IL-1beta and <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi>-1 in macrophages in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Importantly, pre-treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> attenuated these changes in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">Estrogen</z:chebi> negatively regulates both plasma Lp(a) level and Lp(a)-induced vascular remodeling, suggesting that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> might be a strong candidate to reduce serum Lp(a) concentration </plain></SENT>
