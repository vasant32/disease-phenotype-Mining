<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Comprehension of the pathophysiologic characteristics of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> has focused its attention on the study of dynamic and metabolic processes involving the vessel wall as possible causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>When compared with conventional radiologic techniques, sonography has the main advantage of being a real-time imaging modality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> cases in which carotid sonography showed some dynamic features that could not be identified with computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Carotid sonography with high-resolution probes (9-14 MHz) was compared with CT and MRA findings showing carotid axis occlusion in 2 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In case 1, the internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> observed on CT and MRA was interpreted as a dissection on a clinical basis, but sonography showed a mobile <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> originating from the heart in the internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In case 2, the occlusion of the whole carotid axis observed on CT and MRA was instead related to a heart-originating <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> floating in the common carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The evaluation of dynamic aspects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> is fundamental to understanding the pathophysiologic characteristics of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sonography is fundamental in carotid artery imaging for its possibility of showing dynamic processes that could be misdiagnosed with "static" imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The correct identification of the pathophysiologic characteristics of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in these cases could have led to different diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms </plain></SENT>
