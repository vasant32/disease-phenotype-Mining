<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Gene responses were correlated with the metabolic state, as revealed by regional <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> 5'-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15266,18036">triphosphate</z:chebi> bioluminescent imaging, and with the degree of histological damage, as assessed by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">haematoxylin</z:chebi>-eosin staining and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi> nick end labeling (TUNEL), in order to evaluate the role of these genes in the maturation of injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Focal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> developed in the dorsolateral cerebral cortex at the bregma level and the nucleus caudate-putamen within four days after repeated unilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, as indicated by a secondary <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> 5'-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15266,18036">triphosphate</z:chebi> loss after initial <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> 5'-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15266,18036">triphosphate</z:chebi> recovery and by histomorphological signs of pannecrosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The more caudal cortex at hippocampal levels and the hippocampus (CA1&gt;CA3 area), however, exhibited selective neuronal injury without <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> 5'-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15266,18036">triphosphate</z:chebi> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>TUNEL+ cells reached maximum levels in the caudate-putamen at 12-24h, but much later in the cortex and hippocampus at two days after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Remarkably few TUNEL+ cells were noticed in the thalamus, where <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> 5'-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15266,18036">triphosphate</z:chebi> state did not recover after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Following repeated unilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, a transient elevation of ref-1 mRNA was detected after 5h in the cerebral cortex and hippocampal CA1 area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ref-1 mRNA levels decreased within 12-24h, before the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of tissue damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, pag608 and caspase-3 mRNA levels increased, closely in parallel with the appearance of DNA fragmented cells, but slightly prior to the deterioration of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> 5'-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15266,18036">triphosphate</z:chebi> state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the caudate-putamen, pag608 and caspase-3 mRNAs reached maximum levels already 12-24h after repeated common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, when DNA fragmentation was most prominent, and declined thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the cortex and hippocampal CA1-3 areas, where DNA damage appeared more slowly, pag608 and caspase-3 mRNAs were induced starting 24h after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, and remained elevated even after two to four days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The levels of pag608 and caspase-3 mRNAs were similar at rostral and caudal levels of the cortex, as well as in the hippocampal CA1 and CA3 area, although the degree of injury differed considerably between these structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Notably, pag608 and caspase-3 mRNAs were not elevated in the thalamus after repeated unilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The present report shows a close temporal association between the induction of ref-1, pag608 and caspase-3 mRNAs, the manifestation of cell injury and the secondary <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> 5'-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15266,18036">triphosphate</z:chebi> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> in infarcting brain areas, suggesting (i) that de novo responses of these genes may be involved in the maturation of cell injury and (ii) that apoptotic programs and the secondary deterioration of cerebral energy state may interfere with each other after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
