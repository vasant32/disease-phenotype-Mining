<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Reduced expression of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> enzyme CLK-1/MCLK1 (a.k.a </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Coq7), a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> hydroxylase that is necessary for the biosynthesis of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16389">ubiquinone</z:chebi> (UQ), extends lifespan in Caenorhabditiselegans and in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we show that long-lived Mclk1(+/)(-) mutants have enhanced resistance to neurological damage following global <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-reperfusion (I/R) injury induced by transient bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (BCCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both young ( approximately 100days old) and relatively aged ( approximately 450days old) mutants display increased resistance as indicated by a significant decrease in the amount of degenerating cells observed in forebrain cortex and in hippocampal areas after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, less oxidative damage resulting from the procedure was measured in the brain of young Mclk1(+/)(-) animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The finding that both young and old mutants are protected indicates that this is a basic phenotype of these mutants and not a secondary consequence of their slow rate of aging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, the partial resistance to I/R injury suggests that Mclk1(+/)(-) mutants have an enhanced recovery potential following age-dependant vascular accidents, which correlates well with their longer survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>By relating this neuroprotective effect to previously reported characteristics of the Mclk1(+/)(-) phenotype, including altered <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> metabolism and increased HIF-1alpha expression, this study establishes these mutants as useful models to analyze the mechanisms underlying tolerance to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, particularly those associated with ischemic preconditioning, as well as to clarify the relation between aging and age-dependent diseases </plain></SENT>
