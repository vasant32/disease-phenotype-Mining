<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between the prevalence and size of ischemic lesions and cerebral vasomotor reactivity in patients with unilateral occlusion of the ICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Cross-sectional study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Referral center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Seventy consecutive patients were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had a transient or minor disabling <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> that was associated with unilateral occlusion of the ICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ischemic lesions on magnetic resonance imaging were identified on hard copies, and volume measurements were obtained by a magnetic resonance workstation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Vasomotor reactivity was assessed with transcranial Doppler ultrasonography with carbon dioxide challenge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence and size of ischemic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the hemisphere ipsilateral to the ICA occlusion, we found an increased prevalence of internal border zone <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (P =.01), external borders zone <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (P&lt;.001), and territorial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (P =.02) compared with the contralateral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Hemispheres with a carbon dioxide reactivity less than or equal to 18% demonstrated a significant increase in prevalence (P =.007) and volume (P =.003) of internal border zone <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> compared with hemispheres with a carbon dioxide reactivity greater than or equal to 19% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No association between carbon dioxide reactivity and any other type of ischemic lesion was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In patients with an ICA occlusion, only internal border zone <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> demonstrate a significant association with diminished cerebral hemodynamics </plain></SENT>
