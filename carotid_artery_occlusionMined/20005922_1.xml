<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have suggested benefit when CR was administered prior to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether prolonged CR beginning after global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> would result in lasting protection as assessed by performance in the open field, as a measure of functional outcome, and hippocampal CA1 neuronal counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Adult, male Mongolian gerbils were subjected to 5 min bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (ISCH) or sham surgery (SHAM) with tympanic temperature maintained at 36.5+/-0.2 degrees C during the intra-ischemic period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After screening out gerbils with incomplete <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, each of the two surgical groups were randomly assigned to control diet (CON) or 30% CR for the duration of the study (60 d) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Gerbils were tested in the open field on d3, 7, 10, 30 and 60 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ISCH-CON animals showed a significantly higher level of activity in the open field (impaired <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013170" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">habituation</z:e>) compared to SHAM-CON gerbils on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> test days (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Open field activity was significantly lower in the ISCH-CR group than in ISCH-CON gerbils only on d7 (P=0.024) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Open field activity of the SHAM-CR gerbils showed a trend to increase relative to that of SHAM-CON gerbils during the last 30 d of the study (P=0.055 on d60), raising the question of suitability of the open field test for long-term studies of CR and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Brain sections obtained at d60 were stained with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Hippocampal CA1 neuron counts were significantly reduced by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (P&lt;0.001), and there was no sparing effect of CR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that prolonged 30% CR administered beginning after global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> cannot diminish brain injury or enhance long-term recovery </plain></SENT>
