<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had no or only localized low density area on computed tomography, and severe occlusive disease in the ipsilateral common or internal carotid artery on cerebral angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In two patients with internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, both marked decrease in ipsilateral N20 amplitude and prolongation of ipsilateral N20 latency were observed from 5-10 minutes after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These changes gradually improved and resolved 30-45 minutes after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In these cases, stable <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi> CT revealed paradoxical rCBF decrease in the territory of the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Especially, rCBF in the ipsilateral centrum semiovale fell to less than 20 ml/100 g/min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The other patients showed no change in SEPs and no paradoxical decrease in rCBF after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that SEP test with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> loading could be valuable to evaluate a certain group of the patients with severely disturbed cerebral perfusion reserve in the carotid territory and suitable candidate for extracranial-intracranial arterial bypass (EC/IC bypass), although further investigations is needed </plain></SENT>
