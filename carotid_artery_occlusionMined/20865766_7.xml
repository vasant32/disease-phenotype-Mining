<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested the hypothesis that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) predicts MMI within 6 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a prospective, multicenter, observational cohort study patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> main stem occlusion were studied by MRI including diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), perfusion imaging (PI), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>-angiography within 6 hours of symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Multivariate regression analysis was used to identify clinical and imaging predictors of MMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 140 patients included, 27 (19.3%) developed MMI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The following parameters were identified as independent predictors of MMI: larger <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> DWI lesion volume (per 1 ml odds ratio [OR] 1.04, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02-1.06; p &lt; 0.001), combined <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> + internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (5.38, 1.55-18.68; p = 0.008), and severity of neurological deficit on admission assessed by the National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale score (per 1 point 1.16, 1.00-1.35; p = 0.053) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The prespecified threshold of a DWI lesion volume &gt;82 ml predicted MMI with high specificity (0.98, 95% CI 0.94-1.00), negative predictive value (0.90, 0.83-0.94), and positive predictive value (0.88, 0.62-0.98), but sensitivity was low (0.52, 0.32-0.71) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> MRI on admission predicts malignant course in severe <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> with high positive and negative predictive value and may help in guiding treatment decisions, such as decompressive surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In a subset of patients with small initial DWI lesion volumes, repeated diagnostic tests are required </plain></SENT>
