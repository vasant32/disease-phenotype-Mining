<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One hundred and thirty-three of these <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> arose from the internal carotid arteries, 20 from the middle cerebral arteries, and seven from the anterior cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ninety percent of the patients had satisfactory outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The safety of internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> has been greatly enhanced by preoperative flow studies and by test occlusion with an intracarotid balloon to identify those patients who require preliminary extracranial-to-intracranial bypass, which was used in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the middle <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596298" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral occlusions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The anterior cerebral artery had magnificent leptomeningeal collateral flow that prevented infarction even without cross flow </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analysis of poor outcome in 16 patients revealed that hemodynamic ischemic infarction was known to occur after only two of the carotid occlusions </plain></SENT>
