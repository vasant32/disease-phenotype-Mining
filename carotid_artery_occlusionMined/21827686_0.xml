<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0393570" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">corticobasal degeneration</z:e> typically shows focal or asymmetric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath>, usually maximal in the frontoparietal cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Many patients who are diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0393570" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">corticobasal degeneration</z:e> using current diagnostic criteria do not have classical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0393570" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">corticobasal degeneration</z:e> pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our case is remarkable for the fact that the symptoms and the characteristic magnetic resonance imaging appearance were typical for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0393570" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">corticobasal degeneration</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, we were quite convinced that the clinical picture had a vascular etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only a few cases have been reported where the presumed cause for the corticobasal syndrome was multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751955" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain infarctions</z:e> bilaterally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CASE PRESENTATION: A 64-year-old Caucasian man visited a neurologist because of profound asymmetric sensory and motor disturbances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A magnetic resonance imaging scan of his brain revealed occlusion of his internal carotid artery on the left side with multiple vascular lesions in his left hemisphere and notable <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> of mainly the left parietal and frontal cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We describe a patient with corticobasal syndrome caused by multiple infarctions, probably caused by emboli of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This patient illustrates the fact that the word 'syndrome' should be preferred above 'degeneration' in the name of this disease </plain></SENT>
