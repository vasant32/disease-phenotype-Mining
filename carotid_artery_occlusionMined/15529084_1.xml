<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report a case of asymptomatic occlusion of the right internal carotid artery owing to the presence of a rare anatomic variant (occipital artery originating from the extracranial segment of the internal carotid artery) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During the preoperative workup for a coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in a 65-year-old patient, an occlusion of the right internal carotid artery was visualized on Duplex ultrasound </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Distally to the occluded site, the artery was patent thanks to a vessel parallel to it but with a reverse blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MRA and angiography of the brachiocephalic trunk confirmed the occlusion of the internal carotid artery and its opacification distally via an aberrant occipital artery arising at the supra-bulbar level and communicating with the right vertebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therapeutic abstention was decided and the patient was operated of CABG without any neurological complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Occipital artery arising from the internal carotid artery is a rare anomaly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Its association with internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> may be beneficial because it makes surgery possible, even in a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> stage, if the patient is symptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>If the patient is asymptomatic, therapeutic abstention could be considered </plain></SENT>
