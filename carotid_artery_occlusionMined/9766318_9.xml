<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To establish an experimental murine model of transient forebrain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, this study examined the temporal profile of ischemic neuronal damage in the striatum after bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: C57BL/6 mice, which are frequently used for genetic manipulations, were subjected to 15-minute bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ischemic injury was examined (4, 8, 24, 48, and 96 h after reperfusion) by Nissl staining, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15266,18036">triphosphate</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi> nick-end-labeling, and nuclear staining with Hoechst 33258 dye </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Regional cerebral blood flow was decreased to 11 +/- 6% of control values during the ischemic insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Striatal injury was observed in 95% of animals examined after 15-minute bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The number of small and medium-size neurons in the striatum was significantly (P &lt; 0.05) decreased 8 hours after reperfusion and continued to decrease until 96 hours, whereas the number of large neurons remained constant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15266,18036">triphosphate</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi> nick-end-labeling-positive cells appeared in the dorsomedial region of the striatum 48 hours after the ischemic insult and throughout the striatum 96 hours after the ischemic insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Brain sections stained with Hoechst 33258 dye also demonstrated apoptotic nuclei 96 hours after the ischemic insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Striatal injury after transient forebrain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> is reproducible in C57BL/6 mice and is a good model to study the molecular mechanisms of ischemic injury, including delayed neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, using transgenic mice </plain></SENT>
