<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the major physiological role of the immunophilin FK506-binding protein-12 (FKBP12) is a modulation of intracellular calcium flux </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since an increase in intracellular calcium concentration is a major mediator of ischemic neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, we investigated the changes in FKBP12 following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We induced focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> by intraluminal occlusion of the middle cerebral artery for 1 h, and global <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> for 10 min by bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> combined with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The animals were killed at 4 h to 7 days after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry was performed on paraffin sections using a monoclonal antibody raised against recombinant FKBP12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunoreactivity to FKBP12 in control brains was most pronounced in the CA1 subfield of the hippocampus and the striatum, the localization being primarily neuronal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Following focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, FKBP12 immunoreactivity decreased rapidly in the ischemic core by 4 h, but increased in surviving neurons in penumbra areas (4 h-7 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Within an area of infarction, invading leukocytes and macrophages exhibited immunoreactivity to FKBP12 (3-7 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Following global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, FKBP12 immunoreactivity in CA1 neurons decreased after 1 day, and then it was lost between 2 and 7 days, although many CA1 neurons showed a transient increase in FKBP12 at 2 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No FKBP12 immunoreactivity was observed in reactive glial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus, FKBP12 declined in dying neurons, whereas FKBP12 was upregulated in less severely injured neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The findings suggest that (1) FKBP12 plays an important role in the process of neuronal survival and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, and (2) FKBP12 is involved in inflammatory reactions that occur within an area of infarction </plain></SENT>
