<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Transient forebrain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> produced significant increase in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>, glycine and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15891">taurine</z:chebi> (760%, 1070%, 190% and 1210%, respectively), and neuronal blockade by perfusion with a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi> (4 mM)-containing medium resulted in 67%, 79%, 58% and 59% reduction in the peak values of each amino acid, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, an intracerebroventricular administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi>, 0.8 mumol or more, produced a protective effect against delayed damage of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells, which was caused by bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> for 4 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi> may protect neurons against ischemic damage, by preventing the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced rise of extracellular concentration of excitatory amino acid </plain></SENT>
