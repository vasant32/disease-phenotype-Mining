<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Compared to rats at the age of 2 months, the initial peak and the maintained response in 6- 12- and 18-month old rats were well preserved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 1-month old rats, both components were significantly depressed but in 24-month old rats only the initial peak of the pressor response was markedly attenuated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These findings demonstrate that age is an important factor in the response to common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> which is more marked for the initial peak than the maintained response </plain></SENT>
