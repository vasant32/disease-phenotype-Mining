<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The authors previously deduced a formula for calculating the steal index (SI) for evaluation of the steal phenomena during the development of the collateral circulation resulting from unilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> or stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study the authors examine the application of SI in evaluating the steal phenomena of cerebral blood flow in cases of intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformation</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The clinical data of 16 cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> confirmed by both digital subtraction angiography (DSA) and transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasound were analyzed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The ratio of the mean blood velocity in the direct or indirect feeding artery (Vmfv) for the area containing <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> to the mean blood velocity in the neighboring feeding artery (Vmna), Vmfv/Vmna, was compared with SI of the corresponding arteries (SI=1-PI(1)/PI(2), where PI(1) is the pulsatility index of the feeding artery and PI the pulsatility index of the neighboring feeding artery), and the correlation between SI and the size of <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> was analyzed statistically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The Vmfv/Vmna of (2)direct and indirect feeding arteries for <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> both exhibited positive correlation with SI (r=0.62, P&lt;0.05, n=16; r=0.53, P&lt;0.01, n=27), and SI appeared to be in positive correlation with the size of <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp>, but which failed to be supported by statistical analysis (r=0.48, P&gt;0.05, n=12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The sizes, types and development of the vascular bed of <z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVM</z:mp> can be evaluatea by analysis of SI derived from TCD in combination with DSA </plain></SENT>
