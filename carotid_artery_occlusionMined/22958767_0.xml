<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Selecting the appropriate "true lumen", a remnant of what had been the arterial lumen, at the initial step may facilitate the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because plaque at the carotid bifurcation is known to propagate from the posterior wall, a gateway to this "true lumen" should exist in the anterior side of the occluded stump </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This hypothesis was studied retrospectively in our series of revascularizing ICA <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients underwent endovascular revascularization for symptomatic cervical ICA occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Procedures were performed by initially penetrating the occluded stump with a guidewire, followed by supporting catheter advancement through the occluded segment to secure the distal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> arterial lumen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cases were analyzed with regard to the location of initial guidewire penetration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eight patients underwent successful revascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In five cases, the entry point to the occluded stump was located at the anterior side, and in three, at the posterior side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two posterior stump penetration cases were met with resistance in guidewire advancement, whereas penetration was smooth in the anterior cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, two posterior stump penetration cases resulted in contrast stasis in the posterior ICA wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In our series of revascularizing cervical ICA <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> occlusion, initially targeting the anterior side of the occluded stump resulted in favorable results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This may be the result of selecting the "true lumen" at the beginning of the procedure </plain></SENT>
