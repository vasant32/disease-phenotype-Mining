<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To examine the relationship between <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) detected on MRA and vascular risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: We retrospectively assessed 279 patients (mean age, 69.0+/-11.3 years) who visited the Department of Neurology of Masuda Red Cross Hospital and underwent three-dimensional, time-of-flight MRA of the head between January 1996 and October 1998 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007780" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral embolism</z:e> and internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diagnoses were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> (n = 152) and others (n = 127) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We evaluated stenotic or occlusive lesions of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> (M1 portion), using MRA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Age, sex, history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, HbA1c, total cholesterol, fasting <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="39025">high density lipoprotein</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi>(a), blood pressure, hematocrit, smoking and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001712'>left ventricular hypertrophy</z:hpo> (LVH) on ECG were included in the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 36 patients (12.9%) had stenotic or occlusive lesions of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> on MRA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Univariate analysis showed that age, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and HbA1c were significantly correlated with <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that HbA C and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> were significant and independent predictors for <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> and high serum HbAlc levels may contribute to the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0005338'>atherosclerotic lesions</z:mp> of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> in Japanese people </plain></SENT>
