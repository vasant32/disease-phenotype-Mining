<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and Evans blue were given 5 minutes prior to sacrifice to assess the integrity of the blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) at 1 minute, 30 minutes, and 2 hours following the ischemic insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There was immediate permeability to HRP in the early (1 minute and 30 minutes) post-ischemic period, whereas, Evans blue was not seen until the late (1.5 to 2 hours) post-ischemic period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ultrastructural examination showed two routes of barrier permeability to HRP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the early post-ischemic period, HRP was transported by pinocytosis through endothelial cells in areas of brain containing ischemic neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the late post-ischemic period, HRP diffusely leaked into the brain through the necrotic walls of vessels in areas of infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast to previous reports, these results show that the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> becomes permeable immediately following <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, this study shows that <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> permeability to HRP during <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> occurs through two mechanisms: an active, energy-requiring permeability through enhanced pinocytosis within endothelial cells and a passive leakage of protein tracers through necrotic vessel walls </plain></SENT>
