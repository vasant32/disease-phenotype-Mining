<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To investigate this important issue, 44 patients (31 men; 13 women) ranging in age from 44 to 83 (mean, 65.9) years with internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusions</z:mp> as a result of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> were identified among 993 patients undergoing carotid angiography from Jan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>1, 1985 to Dec </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>31, 1989, and their prior medical records were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical presentations included <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in 9 (20.5%), <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in 8 (18.2%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> in 10 (22.7%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100576'>amaurosis fugax</z:hpo> in 4 (9.1%), nonhemispheric symptoms in 3 (6.8%), and 10 (22.7%) were asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A review of these patients' medical records documented that prior hemispheric symptoms referrable to the now occluded internal carotid artery had occurred in five (55%) of the nine patients who were admitted with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, five (62%) of the eight patients with a <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, six (60%) of the 10 patients who were admitted with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four (100%) patients who were admitted with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100576'>amaurosis fugax</z:hpo>, one (33%) of three patients with nonhemispheric symptoms, and in seven (70%) of the 10 patients who were asymptomatic when the internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was identified angiographically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In summary, 28 (64%) of the 44 patients had experienced ipsilateral symptoms from 2 to 120 (mean, 30) months before the diagnosis of internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>; only eight (28%) had undergone noninvasive or angiographic evaluation, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> were placed on antiplatelet therapy when prior hemispheric symptoms developed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
