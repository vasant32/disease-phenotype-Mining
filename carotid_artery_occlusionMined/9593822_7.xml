<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>Cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was induced, using the bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> method, for 20 or 60 min, followed by reperfusion up to 120 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immediately after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> PDH activity increased threefold regardless of ischemic duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the 60-min ischemic group, PDH remained activated, the recovery of high energy phosphates and the clearance of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> were poor, and the rCBF was 48% of controls after 20-min reperfusion, decreasing gradually to 26% at 120-min reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the 20-min ischemic group, PDH activity normalized quickly, the restoration of energy phosphates was good, there was a quick reduction in <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> within the first 60 min of reperfusion, and the rCBF was 65% of control at 20-min reperfusion, and remained over 48% of control throughout reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Recovery of metabolism after reperfusion did not parallel the changes in rCBF in either group, most noticeably in the 60-min ischemic group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The slow normalization of PDH activity reflected the poor recovery of metabolites in the 60-min ischemic group, indicating that PDH activity is important in the resynthesis of energy metabolites during reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, prolonging the ischemic insult effected PDH activity during reperfusion, impaired recovery of energy metabolites, and worsened the recovery of rCBF </plain></SENT>
