<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the consequences of an internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion and collateral blood flow on regional timing parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventeen functionally independent patients with a symptomatic ICA occlusion (15 men, 2 women; mean age, 57 years) and 29 sex- and age-matched control subjects were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ASL at multiple delay times was used to quantify regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) and the transit and trailing edge times (arterial timing parameters) reflecting, respectively, the beginning and end of the labeled bolus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intra-arterial digital subtraction angiography and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography were used to grade collaterals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the hemisphere ipsilateral to the ICA occlusion, the CBF was lower in the anterior frontal (31 +/- 4 versus 47 +/- 3 mL/min/100 g, P &lt; .01), posterior frontal (39 +/- 4 versus 55 +/- 2 mL/min/100 g, P &lt; .01), and frontal parietal region (49 +/- 3 versus 61 +/- 3 mL/min/100 g, P = .04) than that in control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The trailing edge of the frontal-parietal region was longer in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the ICA occlusion compared with that in control subjects (2225 +/- 167 versus 1593 +/- 35 ms, P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In patients with leptomeningeal collateral flow, the trailing edge was longer in the anterior frontal region (2436 +/- 275 versus 1648 +/- 201 ms, P = .03) and shorter in the occipital region (1815 +/- 128 versus 2388 +/- 203 ms, P = .04), compared with patients without leptomeningeal collaterals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Regional assessment of timing parameters with ASL may provide valuable information on the cerebral hemodynamic status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In patients with leptomeningeal collaterals, the most impaired territory was found in the frontal lobe </plain></SENT>
