<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study we have developed an experimental model which enables us to consistently produce focal regions of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> (resulting in infarction) which vary little in size in a number of animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-seven cats (3-4 kg b. wt.) anesthetized with chloralose and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="17967">urethane</z:chebi> were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Physiologic monitoring and adjustments maintained arterial blood values as follows: pCO2 27-35 Torr, pO2 100-150 Torr, pH +/- 7.4, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> 200 mg%, hematocrit greater than 25 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The left middle cerebral artery was exposed via a transorbital approach and occluded for 1-2 h with and without left and/or both carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sixteen hours following the ischemic episode, the animals were sacrificed and sections of fresh brain tissue were processed for vital staining using 1% tetrazolium solution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With this method <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> brain areas appear dark red, ischemic regions (without infarction) appear gray and irreversibly infarcted areas appear pinkish-white </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The volumetric dimensions of the lesioned area were measured using a planimeter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The same tissue was also evaluated histologically by means of standard histopathologic techniques on paraffin-embedded material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Infarcted areas as delineated macroscopically by the tetrazolium correlated well with the light microscopic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Ten animals subjected to a 2-h occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery (LMCA) and both carotid arteries resulted in a reproducible <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> which was 3.2 +/- 0.7 ml in volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This represents 13.3 +/- 2.9% of the total volume of both cerebral hemispheres (above the level of the inferior colliculus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
