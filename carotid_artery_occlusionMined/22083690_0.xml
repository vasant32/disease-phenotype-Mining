<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: There is no clear consensus on how to treat patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) who have severe concomitant carotidcerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate our surgical results in patients with severe carotid and/or cerebrovascular disease undergoing CABG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between October 2003 and April 2009, a total of 47 such patients were treated at our institution with the following strategies: (1) protective carotid artery stenting for severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> performed either before (n = 20) or after (n = 5) CABG or (2) a superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery anastomosis procedure followed by CABG if indicated (n = 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Off-pump CABG was performed in 75% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no major perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> or in-hospital <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>; however, three patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> and two had minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> during the early post-CABG period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the patients with postoperative cerebrovascular events had had unilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> during the follow-up period (up to 6 years, with a mean of 27 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, major adverse cardiocerebrovascular events (MACCE) occurred in seven patients (14.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The rates of freedom from MACCE at 1 and 3 years were 92% and 74%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: It appears that our two-staged approach is safe and may reduce the risk of postoperative cerebrovascular events </plain></SENT>
