<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As most genetic alterations have been performed in mice, it is urgent to develop mouse ischemic preconditioning models for investigating the molecular mechanisms of ischemic preconditioning in transgenic mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we developed a forebrain ischemic preconditioning model in C57Black/Crj6 (C57BL/6) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Forebrain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was induced in C57BL/6 mice (8-10 weeks old) by bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (BCCAO) for 18 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The conditioning ischemic insult lasting for 6 min was carried out 48 h before the 18-min BCCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the seventh day after BCCAO, neuronal damage was visualized by microtubule-associated protein-2 immunohistochemistry and quantified by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52815">cresyl violet</z:chebi> staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Terminal deoxytransferase-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi>-nick end labeling (TUNEL) was performed 72 h after reperfusion to detect DNA fragmentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Ischemia</z:e> for 18 min resulted in injury to the striatum, cortex and hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In comparison to the hippocampus, striatal neuronal injury was more severe and reproducible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although the conditioning <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> itself caused neither noticeable striatal neuronal damage nor DNA fragmentation, it significantly reduced striatal neuronal damage and DNA fragmentation caused by the subsequent 18-min <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that striatal neuronal injury after transient BCCAO can be strongly reduced by a sublethal ischemic episode in C57BL/6 mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>As many kinds of gene-altered C57BL/6 mice are available, this preconditioning model may be useful for investigating the molecular mechanisms of ischemic preconditioning in transgenic mice </plain></SENT>
