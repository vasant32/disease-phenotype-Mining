<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Cerebral perfusion imaging with dual-tracer (Tc-99m and In-111) human albumin microspheres (HAM scintigraphy) was performed in 15 cases with unilateral occlusion of the internal carotid artery, for the diagnosis and evaluation of collateral circulation patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After injection of Tc-99m microspheres into one common carotid artery and In-111 HAMs into the other, two perfusion images, one for each carotid artery, were clearly differentiated by appropriate pulse-height discrimination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With this method, diagnosis of internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was definitely made in eight patients, suspected in six, and missed in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The collateral perfusion areas from the contralateral ICA and ipsilateral external carotid artery were well demonstrated by this method, and the scintigraphic results agreed well with the angiographic findings in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Dual-tracer HAM scintigraphy is capable of adding information about collaterals at the capillary level to the anatomic information obtained by angiography </plain></SENT>
