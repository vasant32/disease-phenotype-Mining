<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present study is to investigate if regional cerebral blood flow and oxygen metabolism, after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, differ between both conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seventeen patients with symptomatic unilateral atherosclerotic internal carotid occlusion and 10 patients with symptomatic internal carotid occlusion due to cervical dissection were submitted to a <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomographic (PET) study between 1 and 2 months after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The steady state technique with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="36932">15O</z:chebi> was used in order to determine regional cerebral blood flow, regional oxygen extraction fraction, and regional cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area, the peri-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> zone, the remaining homolateral hemisphere, and the contralateral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results were compared between both patient's populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patients with cervical dissection were on average much younger than those with atherosclerotic occlusion, but neurological impairment on admission and disability at 3 months were comparable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Between both patient populations, no differences in rCBF, rOEF, and rCMRO2 could be demonstrated in the different regions of interest when the results were age-adjusted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Except for age-related changes, no differences in PET findings could be demonstrated between patients with symptomatic internal carotid occlusion caused by either <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> or cervical dissection </plain></SENT>
