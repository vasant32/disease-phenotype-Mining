<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Brain concentrations of interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) were increased during the early recirculation period ( &lt; 6 h) after 10 min of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, with lesser degrees of elevation following only 5 min of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>TNF-alpha levels in the hippocampus and striatum were significantly increased as early as 1 h after recirculation, declining sharply to control levels by 12 h, then transiently increasing at 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Elevated levels of IL-1 beta and IL-6 were not seen until 3-6 h post-occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No significant increases in cytokine concentrations were observed in the cerebellum or thalamus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that regionally selective increases in cytokines may be involved in the pathophysiological changes in hippocampus and striatum following transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
