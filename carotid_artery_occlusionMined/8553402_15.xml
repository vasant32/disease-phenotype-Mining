<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Near-infrared spectroscopy is a technique that can potentially monitor changes in cerebral oxygenation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are at present limited clinical data regarding the value of this technology in relating neurological outcome to cerebrovascular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> oxygen saturation (ScO2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This investigation reports changes in ScO2 due to carotid cross-clamping during carotid endarterectomy in awake patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: ScO2 was monitored in 38 adult patients undergoing 41 carotid endarterectomies under regional anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres were monitored simultaneously during 36 operations, with ipsilateral monitoring alone in the remaining 5 operations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No significant difference was detected between ipsilateral and contralateral ScO2 during preclamp or postclamp periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Carotid cross-clamping caused a statistically significant (P &lt; .01) decrease in the ipsilateral ScO2, which decreased from 71.8 +/- 6.91% to 65.8 +/- 8.2%, while the contralateral ScO2 remained stable at 70.5 +/- 7.5% and 70.3 +/- 7.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The change in ipsilateral ScO2 ranged from +2.6% to -28.6% of the preclamp value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The difference between ipsilateral and contralateral ScO2 during cross-clamping was statistically significant (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The duration of cross-clamping was 39 +/- 11 minutes (range, 18 to 89 minutes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The decrease in ipsilateral ScO2 was highly variable from patient to patient and did not correlate with the duration of cross-clamping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> causes a statistically significant but variable decrease in ScO2 in the majority of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Data in this investigation provide a range of ScO2 values that was not associated with a clinically detectable neurological dysfunction </plain></SENT>
