<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Traditionally contrast arteriography has been used to confirm the diagnosis despite its cost and potential dangers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one patients with 23 ICA occlusions were evaluated by a 3-dimensional time of flight magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cervical carotids and circle of Willis were imaged during the MRA examination which lasted 30 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Confirmatory conventional angiography was performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using angiography as the gold standard, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> occlusions were correctly diagnosed by MRA and 22 of 23 occlusions correctly diagnosed by Duplex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was good agreement between MRA and angiography for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 42 ICAs imaged (Kappa statistic 0.83) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis of internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> is critical as it determines the need for operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In this situation MRA provides a useful non-invasive complement to Duplex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A combination of non-invasive studies may enable arteriography to be rejected with greater confidence in this high risk group </plain></SENT>
