<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effects of propentofylline (<z:chebi fb="6" ids="50459">PPF</z:chebi>, 25 mg kg(-1) body weight per day) on rat cerebral energy state and cytokine expression as well as on behaviour and histopathology were studied after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and long-term permanent bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (BCCAO) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the absence of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="50459">PPF</z:chebi>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> led to a decrease in energy-rich phosphates in parietotemporal cortex and hippocampus which correlated with an increase in <z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> concentrations measured by high-performance liquid chromatography technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The concentrations of cortical cytokines TNF alpha and IL1 beta were increased 12 and 19 fold, respectively </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="6" ids="50459">PPF</z:chebi> had a neuroprotective action after 20 min of BCCAO, reducing the deleterious effect of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> on rat brain energy state and microglial reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Simultaneously, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="50459">PPF</z:chebi> treatment increased cyclic-<z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi> 3 fold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three weeks of permanent BCCAO did not significantly disturb brain energy metabolism, microglial reaction or histopathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, a significant reduction of 30 -- 50% in rat memory capacities and a locomotor <z:hpo ids='HP_0000752'>hyperactivity</z:hpo> were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Continuous <z:chebi fb="6" ids="50459">PPF</z:chebi>-application, however, led to a marked increase in rat working memory and to reduced locomotor activity, which were returned nearly to control levels by 1 week after permanent BCCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In summary, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="50459">PPF</z:chebi> showed a clear neuroprotective effect on cerebral energy state and pro-inflammatory cytokines under conditions of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Continuous administration of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="50459">PPF</z:chebi> led to memory improvement during permanent BCCAO </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>These results underscore the benefit of treatment with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="50459">PPF</z:chebi> in clinical practice, particularly during <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, but also in cerebrovascular and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0524851" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurodegenerative disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
