<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The intravenous (i.v.) administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6123">ketanserin</z:chebi> (0.1-0.4 mg/kg) produced immediate and sustained decreases in systemic blood pressure and heart rate in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7983">pentobarbitone</z:chebi>-anaesthetized dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6123">ketanserin</z:chebi> did not inhibit common carotid vasoconstrictor responses to intraarterial (i.a.) <z:chebi fb="15" ids="33569">noradrenaline</z:chebi>, pre-ganglionic stimulation of the sectioned cervical sympathetic nerve, or i.v. <z:chebi fb="164" ids="18723">nicotine</z:chebi>, thus the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6123">ketanserin</z:chebi> are not due to blockade of vascular alpha-adrenoceptors, adrenergic neurone blockade, or ganglionic blockade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Systemic pressor responses to i.v. <z:chebi fb="164" ids="18723">nicotine</z:chebi>, which produces sympathetic activation by both central and ganglionic stimulating actions, and to common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, were inhibited by 0.1-0.4 mg/kg of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6123">ketanserin</z:chebi> i.v </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that in the anaesthetized dog, the hypotensive action of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6123">ketanserin</z:chebi> involves a centrally mediated inhibition of sympathetic tone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Peripheral vascular 5-HT2 receptor blockade does not appear to be responsible for the hypotensive effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6123">ketanserin</z:chebi> in this model, although this does not preclude the involvement of such a mechanism in its clinical <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> action </plain></SENT>
