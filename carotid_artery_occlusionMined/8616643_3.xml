<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the role of the end-diastolic velocity (EDV) in the common carotid artery (CCA) as a marker of internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Validation of retrospective data in a prospective clinical study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The EDV in 94 patients with total ICA occlusion and in 24 patients with high grade (95-99%) unilateral ICA stenosis identified on extracranial carotid colour-flow Duplex imaging (CFDI) and arteriography was reviewed, and was retrospectively compared to the EDV of 176 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Identification of patients with ICA occlusion was most accurate (99.3%) with an ipsilateral EDV &gt; or = 12 cm/s and a DIFF &gt; or = 10 cm/s (DIFF = contralateral EDV -- ipsilateral EDV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These values were then prospectively applied to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 886 patients (67 with high grade stenosis or occlusion) who underwent CFDI at our institution during 1994 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The EDV &gt; or = 12 had a 92% sensitivity, a 99.4% negative predictive value (NPV) and a 85% specificity in distinguishing between occluded and patent ICA's </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In combination with a DIFF &gt; or = 10 was 80.4% sensitive and 97.5% specific </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The positive predictive value of the EDV &gt; or = 12 in the distinction between 95-99% ICA stenosis and ICA occlusion was 78.3%, and that of the combination was 85.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The EDV was rarely zero and 10% of patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or minimally diseased ICA's had an EDV &gt; or = 12 and/or a DIFF &gt; or = 10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The EDV &lt; or = 12 cm/s is a sensitive marker of ICA occlusion with a high NPV and in combination with the DIFF &gt; or = 10 cm/s, is specific </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, EDV parameters are inaccurate in the distinction of 95-99% ICA stenosis from occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Low EDV can be found in a number of patients with minor or no ICA disease, particularly in those with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or silent cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
