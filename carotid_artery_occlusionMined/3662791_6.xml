<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A technically satisfactory endarterectomy was confirmed by completion arteriogram in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> instances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Indications for venous patch graft included a diameter of the internal carotid artery of less than 3.0 mm (49 patients); an internal carotid artery diameter of less than 3.5 mm, with contralateral internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (nine patients); unexpected stenosis detected by completion arteriogram (six patients); a reexploration for neurologic deficit following conventional CEA (three patients); and irregular surface or edges of the endarterectomy site or high extension of a plaque (16 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Late follow-up arteriograms (66 studies) after a mean two-year interval revealed three instances (4.5%) of recurrent asymptomatic stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four patients (6%) developed late occlusions; three were asymptomatic and one was associated with major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> 2 1/2 years later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One patient (1.5%) developed a false <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One patient experienced a postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no operative mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Six patients died in the late follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The venous patch graft ensured immediate patency of the internal carotid artery but failed to prevent recurrent stenosis or occlusion in internal carotid arteries less than 3.0 mm in diameter </plain></SENT>
