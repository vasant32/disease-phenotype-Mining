<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We describe a successful percutaneous transluminal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PTD</z:e>) of an innominate <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> in a 40-year-old patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003490" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic arch syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Five years earlier both a left central carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and an innominate and left subclavian <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> were treated by grafting from the aorta to the distal vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At recurrence of the neurological symptoms, reocclusion of the graft to the innominate artery and subtotal stenosis of the left carotid anastomosis were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To prevent the hazards of a reoperation, the innominate <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> was dilated by means of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PTD</z:e> via the right brachial artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Success of the procedure was demonstrated by Doppler sonography and angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It appears that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PTD</z:e> serves as an excellent method of treating stenoses of the aortic arch branches in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003490" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aortic arch syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
