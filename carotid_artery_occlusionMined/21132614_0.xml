<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Anastomosis of the superficial temporal artery (STA) to the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) is useful for treating certain patients with internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> or <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, in the case of common carotid artery (CCA) occlusion, since the blood flow in the STA is insufficient, another artery should be used as the donor artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cortical branches of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> are usually selected as recipients in the STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the intracranial vascular filling gradually increases over a few months after conventional cortical <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> bypass grafting, while early or even immediate vascular filling is observed after proximal <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> bypass grafting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This study aims to develop an elongation technique of the contralateral STA to reach the proximal segment of the ipsilateral <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Anastomosis of the contralateral STA to the secondary trunk of the ipsilateral <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> was performed in 2 patients with occlusion of the CCA and ipsilateral vertebral artery (VA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The contralateral STA was extended with a radial artery (RA) graft in order to supply blood to the ischemic area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Elongation of the STA by using an RA interposition graft sufficiently lengthens the graft to enable its anastomosis with the contralateral M2 segment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Postoperative imaging revealed good bypass patency even at 1 year after the surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This novel technique of performing the "bonnet" bypass was effective in treating both CCA and ipsilateral VA occlusion; moreover, this procedure of elongation of the STA can increase candidates of the recipient, and enables one to perform a double bypass to the anterior cerebral artery (ACA) or posterior cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
