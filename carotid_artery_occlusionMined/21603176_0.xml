<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with carotid occlusion and continued neurological worsening or fluctuations present enormous treatment challenges </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These patients may present "slow" <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> that present significant challenges and risks during attempts at revascularization of the occluded artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We present such a case in which we used multimodal imaging techniques, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>-perfusion, to facilitate endovascular revascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our approach of delayed but cautious intra-arterial thrombolytic therapy, guided by brain imaging, and followed by stent placement across the residual stenosis, enabled revascularization of the occluded artery without overt in-hospital complications </plain></SENT>
