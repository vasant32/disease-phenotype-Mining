<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Oral budralazine and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7565">nifedipine</z:chebi>, at doses that increased cerebral blood flow (CBF) in SHR in our previous study (Tanaka, S. et al., Folia Pharmacol, Japan, 87, 1986), significantly improved cerebral energy failure after the BCAO, but <z:chebi fb="1" ids="8364">prazosin</z:chebi> which does not increase CBF had no effect on the energy failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the amelioration by these <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive drugs</z:chebi> of the energy failure after the BCAO results from its CBF-increasing effects in SHR </plain></SENT>
