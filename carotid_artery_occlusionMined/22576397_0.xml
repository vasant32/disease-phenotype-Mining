<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>He developed consciousness disturbance and left <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> after a postural change in rehabilitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CT showed multiple air densities within the right hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An echocardiography showed a large right-to-left (RL) shunt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We considered the reason to be that a small amount of air entered, and the Valsalva-like maneuver with the postural change moved air into arterial circulation through the RL shunt and embolized a brain artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The present case showed that even a small amount of air in the venous circulation may become a potential risk for cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_111'>air embolism</z:mpath>, especially in the presence of a large RL shunt </plain></SENT>
