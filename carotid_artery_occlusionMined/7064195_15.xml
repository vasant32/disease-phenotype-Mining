<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirty minutes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, which depleted levels of ATP and phosphocreatine throughout the cerebral cortex, was followed by 2-4 hours of recirculation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During the recovery period, cortical perfusion and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16908">NADH</z:chebi> fluorescence were monitored through a cranial window </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Postischemic perfusion, as indicated by transit time, was initially higher than control, but declined to subnormal levels by 60 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="16908">NADH</z:chebi> fluorescence transients, induced by brief <z:mp ids='MP_0002316'>anoxia</z:mp>, also decreased steadily during recirculation, indicating a failure of oxidation-reduction capability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The disappearance of anoxic-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16908">NADH</z:chebi> transients usually preceded the decline of flow, suggesting that O2 delivery was not the factor limiting redox reactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, tissue levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16908">NADH</z:chebi>, which were nearly <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> after 2-4 hours of recirculation, did not indicate tissue <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In spite of normalization of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16908">NADH</z:chebi>, resynthesis of high energy phosphates were severely impaired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The degree of ATP recovery varied widely in different cortical regions; however, there were two general groups of ATP values--one at 5% and the other at 70% of control levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the energy-depleted areas, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16908">NADH</z:chebi> levels were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, but the total pool of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="13389">NAD</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16908">NADH</z:chebi> + <z:chebi fb="0" ids="13389">NAD</z:chebi>+) and the tissue content of K+ were 43% lower than control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="13389">NAD</z:chebi> pool and K+ content were only slightly diminished in the regions with greater ATP restitution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that postischemic resynthesis of ATP may be limited not by inadequate delivery of O2, but rather by defective production of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16908">NADH</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
