<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After 30 min the arterial clamp was removed and the animals were reoxygenated and allowed to survive for 1 min (6 animals), 30 min (12 animals), or 1 1/2 to 2 h (6 animals) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The animals were reanesthetized and sacrificed by perfusion-fixation with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31962">paraformaldehyde</z:chebi>-glutaraldehyde </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Light and electron microscopy revealed ischemic cell change in neurons in the ipsilateral cerebral cortex, striatum and hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These changes were mild to moderate in the early post-ischemic period and severe in the post-ischemic period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral infarction</z:e> was present in one of the 30 min survivors and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the 1 1/2 to 2 h survivors </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>They were not present in areas of brain showing only mild to moderate ischemic cell change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings showed that platelet <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> form in association with cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and suggested that they are induced by tissue <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> rather than by neuronal ischemic cell change alone </plain></SENT>
