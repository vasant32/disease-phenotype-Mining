<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It remains controversial whether extracranial-intracranial (EC-IC) arterial bypass surgery leads to a significant increase in brain blood supply, allowing the reversal of regional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1695782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral hypoperfusion</z:e> in symptomatic patients with occlusive cerebrovascular disease and hemodynamic impairment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to determine the effects of EC-IC bypass surgery on cerebral brain-supplying blood volume flow (BVF; ml/min) from a purely hemodynamic point of view, using 2D cine phase-contrast <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five patients with symptomatic, unilateral internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion and hemodynamic compromise received EC-IC arterial bypass surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent quantitative BVF measurements of brain-supplying arteries preoperatively and postoperatively, including the direct BVF measurement in the established EC-IC bypass after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Preoperatively, total brain BVF was reduced in comparison to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (595 +/- 89 vs 663 +/- 49 ml/min; [mean +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>]; p = 0.039) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean BVF through the EC-IC bypass reached 84 +/- 32 ml/min (range: 14-177 ml/min), leading to a significant net increase in total BVF of 78 +/- 43 ml/min (range: 7-136 ml/min) when compared with BVF prior to surgery (p &lt; 0.001), with resulting postoperative BVF reaching values obtained in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>EC-IC arterial bypass surgery increases total brain blood supply, allowing restoration of local perfusion in hemodynamically compromised brain tissue in patients with symptomatic ICA occlusion </plain></SENT>
