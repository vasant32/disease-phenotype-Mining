<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001653'>Mitral valve regurgitation</z:hpo> was caused by structural deterioration of the bioprosthetic valve, and replacement of the bioprosthesis was indicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Digital subtraction angiography revealed occlusion of the left internal carotid artery, which put this patient at high risk to cerebral complications during heart valve surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> induced a marked decrease in the blood flow in the left cerebral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Re-replacement of the mitral valve was successfully performed under high-flow cardiopulmonary bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intra-aortic balloon pumping produced pulsatile blood flow with a peak pressure of 90-100 mmHg during the cardiopulmonary bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>She recovered after surgery with no neurological complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We believe the pulsatile cerebral perfusion produced by the intra-aortic balloon pumping with high-flow cardiopulmonary bypass was effective for preventing cerebral complications in this patient with internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
