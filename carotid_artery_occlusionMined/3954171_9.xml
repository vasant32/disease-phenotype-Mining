<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The goal of our study was to evaluate the effectiveness of postinsult treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28240">dichloroacetate</z:chebi> (DCA) in controlling increases in brain <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> following partial global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="26345">PGI</z:chebi>) in rats </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Animals that received DCA immediately after a 30-minute ischemic insult (n = 5) or 15 minutes after the end of an ischemic insult (n = 5) had cortical <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> levels that were significantly lower (P less than .005) than <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> levels in untreated insulted animals and that were not significantly different than those previously obtained with preinsult DCA treatment in rats subjected to 30 minutes of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="26345">PGI</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treatment of rats with DCA following <z:chebi fb="2" ids="26345">PGI</z:chebi> may be effective in reducing cortical <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> levels and hence may limit irreversible damage to brain cells following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
