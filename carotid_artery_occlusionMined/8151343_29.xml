<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Over the past 3 1/2 years, 89 patients with paraclinoidal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> have been treated at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-nine (44%) of these patients presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 149 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> and six <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformations</z:hpo> have been identified in this patient group such that 38 (43%) of the patients suffered multiple vascular anomalies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Temporary <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> has been employed during operation in 48 cases (54%), permanent carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in four (4%), and hypothermic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0444720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">circulatory arrest</z:e> in two (2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two patients harbored giant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, seven of which had ruptured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Outcome was considered good in 77 patients (86.5%), fair in eight (9%), and poor in three (3%); one patient died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This concentrated experience permitted a practical anatomical grouping of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> into three types: carotid-ophthalmic artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> with a superior or superomedial projection (44 cases); superior hypophyseal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> with a medial or inferomedial projection (26 cases); and proximal posterior carotid artery wall <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> projecting posteriorly or posterolaterally (19 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Despite the fact that paraclinoidal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> often disobey the traditional teachings of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> development, having no vessel of origin or clear hemodynamic cause, this practical grouping has allowed individualized and focused operative approaches unique to each <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> projection with good visual function and outcome in most patients </plain></SENT>
