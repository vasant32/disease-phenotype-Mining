<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This paper provides information on both surgical technique and methods of quantification of ischemic damage to both gray and white matter in the miniature pig </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixteen male miniature pigs were randomly divided into three groups and underwent transcranial surgery involving a frontotemporal approach with orbital rim osteotomy for permanent middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO; five animals), permanent internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (ICAO; six animals), and a sham operation (five animals) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Histological mapping and magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) imaging were used to delineate the areas of ischemic damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The volumes of infarction measured directly from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images were 16.2 +/- 1.1, 1.5 +/- 0.5, and 0.0 +/- 0.0 cm3 (mean +/- standard deviation [SD], p &lt; 0.001) in the MCAO, ICAO, and sham-operated groups, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The areas of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> identified through histological analysis and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging showed a good correlation (r2 = 0.86, p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical staining with an amyloid precursor protein (APP) antibody was used to evaluate axonal damage and calculate a total APP score for axonal damage of 44.8 +/- 2.9 in the MCAO, 13.2 +/- 6.6 in the ICAO, and 0.0 +/- 0.0 (mean +/- SD, p &lt; 0.002) in the sham-operated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This new model of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> induces a reproducible amount of ischemic damage in both gray and white matter, and has significant utility for studies of the pathophysiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in the gyrencephalic brain and for assessment of the therapeutic efficacy of drugs prior to the initiation of human clinical trials </plain></SENT>
