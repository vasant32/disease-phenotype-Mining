<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was undertaken to examine the effects of human recombinant <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase on the delayed neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of CA1 neurons and on the change in the expression of messenger <z:chebi fb="3" ids="33697">ribonucleic acid</z:chebi> for endogenous copper-zinc <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">transient ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Human recombinant <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (8 x 10(5) units/kg) or apo-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase was administered intravenously 1 minute before bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in gerbils divided among four experimental groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Endogenous copper-zinc <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase messenger <z:chebi fb="3" ids="33697">ribonucleic acid</z:chebi> was analyzed by in situ hybridization histochemistry using a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37983">sulfur-35</z:chebi>-labeled oligonucleotide probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical localizations of administered human recombinant <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> gerbils receiving apo-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase exhibited almost complete destruction of CA1 neurons 7 days after 5 minutes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The gerbils treated with human recombinant <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase showed mild lesions (p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Discrete localizations were observed for endogenous copper-zinc <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase messenger <z:chebi fb="3" ids="33697">ribonucleic acid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Transient ischemia</z:e> increased labeling throughout the hippocampus after 30 minutes and 24 hours of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This increase was abolished by treatment with human recombinant <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This phenomenon was confirmed by Northern blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The interneurons in CA3 and cells in the hilus were mainly stained against administered <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase at 5 and 30 minutes, and these reactions had disappeared at 20 hours after the administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate protective effects of human recombinant <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase against ischemic neuronal damage and support the hypothesis that the generated free radicals induce a vicious cycle leading to delayed neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
