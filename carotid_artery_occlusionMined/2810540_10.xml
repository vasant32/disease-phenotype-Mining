<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Over a 7-year period (1980 to 1987) 24 patients (18 men: mean age 67 years; range, 52 to 78 years, and six women: mean age 67 years; range, 46 to 82 years) undergoing serial carotid artery duplex scans were observed to progress to unilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The occlusions were associated with ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> in six (25%), ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> in four (16%), and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of nonhemispheric symptoms in one (5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients had no symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Follow-up ranged from 4 months to 96 months (mean 39.4 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Late neurologic events comprised two <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, three <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of nonhemispheric symptoms in six, which in some were disabling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients had no symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occurred (one was <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> related) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For late events by life-table analysis, the average annual rate over the first 2 years for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was 10% and for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> 13% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The combined rate for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was 20% per annum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For nonhemispheric symptoms the rate for the first year was 31% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that unilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> is associated with an unacceptable incidence of immediate neurologic sequelae and that such patients continue to have a high rate of late neurologic deficits at follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Therefore it seems appropriate that patients who are observed to progress to high-grade stenosis and are therefore at risk for immediate occlusion should undergo prophylactic carotid endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
