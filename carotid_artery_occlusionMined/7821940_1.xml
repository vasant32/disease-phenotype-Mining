<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The brains were perfusion-fixed with <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16842">formaldehyde</z:chebi>, embedded in paraffin, subserially sectioned, and stained with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi>-eosin/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52815">cresyl violet</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mild ipsilateral neuronal damage was observed after unilateral permanent occlusion, but confined only to the hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Damage of neocortical neurons began to appear after 1 day following bilateral permanent occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Damage was worst over the superolateral convexity of both hemispheres, CA 4 and subiculur neurons; subsequently other sectors of hippocampus and other brain structures were affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Some damaged neurons in the superficial cortex and CA 1 sector of hippocampus, and almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> in the other regions of brain reverted to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> profile by 3 months of recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> brain structures showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> profiles, except a relative neuronal rarefication in neocortex and CA 1 sector of hippocampus after 3 months of recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggests that only CCA occlusion causes partial/incomplete <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in the rat brain, where damaging effects are counterbalanced by metabolic and circulatory adjustments </plain></SENT>
