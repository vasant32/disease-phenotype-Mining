<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: This open single-center prospective study aimed to determine the redistribution of blood flow within the circle of Willis and through collateral pathways after carotid endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Blood flow velocity and flow direction in the major cerebral arteries were determined, both at rest and during <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16526">CO(2)</z:chebi> inhalation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Carotid endarterectomy was performed in 148 patients with a 70% or greater diameter stenosis of the internal carotid artery while patients were under general anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Arteriotomy closure was done with a venous patch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Selective shunting was performed with an electroencephalogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Baseline blood flow velocity of the basal cerebral arteries was measured by means of transcranial Doppler sonography preoperatively (within 1 week before surgery) and 3 months postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At the same times, cerebrovascular reactivity was calculated during <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16526">CO(2)</z:chebi> inhalation insonating both middle cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Baseline blood flow velocity in the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery hardly changed 3 months postoperatively, but there was a considerable redistribution of flow in the circle of Willis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This was characterized by a decrease in contribution from the contralateral hemisphere through the anterior communicating artery, reduced cerebropetal flow rates in the ophthalmic artery, and smaller contribution of the posterior collateral sources </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16526">CO(2)</z:chebi> reactivity on the side of surgery increased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In patients with a contralateral occlusion, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16526">CO(2)</z:chebi> reactivity increased on both sides </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The redistribution of flow was most pronounced in patients who needed intraoperative shunting and in patients with a contralateral internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: After carotid endarterectomy, flow redistribution, as expressed by changes in blood flow velocity values, occurs in the circle of Willis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The contribution of collateral sources is diminished, and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16526">CO(2)</z:chebi> reactivity increases, both of which reflect improvement of the hemodynamic condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The most improvement occurs in patients with contralateral occlusion </plain></SENT>
