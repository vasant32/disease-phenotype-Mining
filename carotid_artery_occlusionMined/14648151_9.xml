<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of our study was to assess whether patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery disease</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> are cognitively impaired, to describe the frequency, nature and severity of this impairment, and to search for associated patient characteristics.Thirty-nine consecutive patients with carotid occlusion and ipsilateral cerebral or <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo>, and 46 healthy controls underwent extensive neuropsychological assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Performances were compared group-wise with analysis of variance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> in the individual patient was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Associations between illness characteristics and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> were explored with regression analysis.Fifty-four percent of patients were cognitively impaired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>Cognitive deficits</z:hpo> were non-specific in nature and mild in severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Impairment occurred also in patients with isolated <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> symptoms and in those without visible ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> on MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neither the presence of any vascular risk factor, the side of the symptomatic carotid occlusion, the uni- or bilaterality of carotid occlusion, nor the number of cerebral ischemic lesions were predictors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that about half of the patients with carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> are cognitively impaired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive deficits</z:hpo> in patients with isolated <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> symptoms and in those without cerebral ischemic lesions on MRI argues against an exclusive role for structural brain damage in the pathogenesis of these deficits </plain></SENT>
