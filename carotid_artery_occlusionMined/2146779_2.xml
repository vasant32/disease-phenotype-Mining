<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In previous studies using the gerbil carotid occlusion model, we demonstrated that CA1b pyramidal cell degeneration is preceded by a period of enhanced excitatory transmission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Experiments with hippocampal slices prepared after 5 minutes of bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> show that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> enhances excitatory synaptic transmission and reduces pyramidal cell excitability before it abolishes synaptic function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that these effects require the activation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">N-methyl-D-aspartate</z:chebi> receptors during the postischemic period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hippocampal slices were prepared 20-30 minutes after carotid occlusion, and Schaffer collateral-commissural input-output curves were constructed from recordings made every 30-60 minutes for 11-14 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Inclusion of the selective, reversible <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">N-methyl-D-aspartate</z:chebi> receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> 3-((+-)-2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl)-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="26308">propyl</z:chebi>-1-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="44976">phosphonic acid</z:chebi> in the superfusion medium completely prevented the progressive loss of pyramidal cell excitability that normally follows this ischemic insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> also prevented the postischemic increases in the duration and initial slope of the focally-recorded excitatory postsynaptic potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> could still partially block the effects of transient forebrain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> when treatment was delayed for 4 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results confirm that the deleterious electrophysiologic changes in area CA1b depend on the continuing activation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">N-methyl-D-aspartate</z:chebi> receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Delayed ischemic neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> may result, in part, from excessive synaptic excitation during the postischemic period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, other factors that are eliminated by preparing hippocampal slices appear to play an important role as well </plain></SENT>
