<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Inducible nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (iNOS) is essential for the preconditioning induced by transient bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (BCCAO) or by systemic administration of the endotoxin <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi> (LPS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used a model of brain injury produced by neocortical injection of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">N-methyl-D-aspartate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi>) to investigate the mechanisms by which iNOS-derived nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) contributes to tolerance induced by LPS or BCCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that the tolerance is blocked by the iNOS inhibitor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40618">aminoguanidine</z:chebi>, is not observed in iNOS-null mice, and is rescued by the NO donor <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35739">DTPA</z:chebi> NONOate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">Lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi> failed to induce preconditioning in mice lacking the nox2 subunit of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25523">nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi>) oxidase, suggesting that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> derived from <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi> oxidase is needed for the induction of the tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Because <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> reacts with NO to form <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi>, we investigated the role of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found that LPS induces the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi> marker 3-nitrotyrosine in cortical neurons and that the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi> decomposition catalyst FeTPPS abolishes LPS-induced preconditioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the protective effect of iNOS-derived NO is mediated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi> formed by the reaction of NO with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi> oxidase-derived <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25941">peroxynitrite</z:chebi>, in addition to its well-established deleterious role in ischemic brain injury and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegeneration</z:hpo>, can also be beneficial by inducing tolerance to excitotoxicity </plain></SENT>
