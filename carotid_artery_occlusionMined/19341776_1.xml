<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the mechanism underlying the neuroprotective effects of the ethanolic extract of the seeds of Cassia obtusifolia (COE) (10 or 50mg/kg/day, p.o) on transient cerebral global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> induced by bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (2VO) in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical and western blot studies showed that levels of inducible nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in the hippocampal CA1 region at 1day post-2VO were attenuated by COE (50mg/kg/day, p.o), which was administered immediately after 2VO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, OX-42 - and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive cell numbers at 4 days post-2VO were markedly attenuated by COE (50mg/kg/day, p.o) treatment for 4 days in CA1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Viable neurons detected by Nissl at 7 days post-2VO were increased by administering COE (50mg/kg/day, p.o) for 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, COE increased the expressions of phosphorylated cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in CA1 in na√Øve-control within 1 and 6h, respectively, and these expressions were also profoundly increased in 2VO-treated mice by COE at immediately post-2VO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the neuroprotective effects of COE are due to its anti-inflammatory effects and to its upregulation of BDNF expression and CREB phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
