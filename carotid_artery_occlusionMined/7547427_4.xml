<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Transient global brain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> was produced for 5 minutes by a combination of bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and oligaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> (40 mmHg) induced by exsanguination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The number of viable neurons in the CA1 subfield was counted under a light microscope 7 days after the ischaemic insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The density of viable neurons in the CA1 subfield of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rats was around 150 cells/mm of CA1 length in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the strains examined; after global brain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e>, this parameter in Sprague-Dawley, Wistar and Fischer 344 strain rats was approximately 110, 120, and 70, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that the hippocampal CA1 neurons of Fischer 344 strain rats are more vulnerable to ischaemic insult than those of the other strains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were many F344 rats (8/21) which showed atypical vasculature patterns in the posterior region of the circle of Willis, suggesting less blood flow through anastomosis from basilar artery to posterior cerebral artery and/or ill-balanced blood flow between left and right hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These anatomical variations in the circle of Willis may in part contribute to the strain differences in the vulnerability to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
