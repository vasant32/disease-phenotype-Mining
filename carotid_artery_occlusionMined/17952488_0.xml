<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: An occluded internal carotid artery (ICA) is considered a "safe artery" as it causes few symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it has recently been suggested that spontaneous recanalisation of ICA occlusions may occur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIM: To determine the incidence of ICA recanalisation among patients with a previously documented occluded ICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with a documented ICA occlusion between September 2001 and January 2003 were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients who consented to participate had carotid duplex scans performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Demographic and clinical data were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Statistical analyses were performed as appropriate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The total number of carotid duplex scans performed during the original study period was 719 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An occluded ICA was identified in 30 (4.2%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of 19 patients who were rescanned two (11%) had recanalised a previously occluded ICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Recanalisation occurs in a small number of patients who may need long-term surveillance </plain></SENT>
