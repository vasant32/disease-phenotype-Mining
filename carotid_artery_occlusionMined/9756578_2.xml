<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND and PURPOSE: We correlated the mean transcranial Doppler blood flow velocity (FVm) during carotid endarterectomy with the functional collateral pathway(s) documented by angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Three patient groups were established: group 1 was dependent on the anterior communicating artery, group 2 on the anterior communicating artery and ipsilateral posterior communicating artery, and group 3 on the ipsilateral posterior communicating artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Continuous middle cerebral artery FVm and electroencephalographic monitoring were performed in 45 patients during carotid endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Clamped FVm was lowest in group 3 at 17+/-9 cm/s versus 36+/-16 and 33+/-11 cm/s for groups 1 and 2 (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FVm values in groups 1 and 2 were similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was significant cerebral arterial vasodilation in group 3 patients on the basis of a pulsatility index of 0.38+/-0.15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The maximum FVm after clamp release was similar among the 3 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Normalized blood flow velocity 1 minute before release of the clamp was increased from the minimum flow velocity after clamping only in group 1 and 2 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The ipsilateral posterior communicating artery is a minor collateral pathway during <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> carotid occlusion that contributes little to the collateral flow if there is a functional anterior communicating artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Collateral flow through the middle cerebral artery is not recruited during occlusion in group 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The reperfusion FVm transient is independent of the primary collateral pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Documentation of functional collateral pathways on the basis of Doppler or angiographic examination may be advantageous in future studies since it can provide the basis for comparison among studies </plain></SENT>
