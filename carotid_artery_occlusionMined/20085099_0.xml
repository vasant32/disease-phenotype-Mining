<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mortality rate is estimated at 80% with maximum conservative medical treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have performed external decompression associated with anterior and medial temporal lobectomy (AMTL) as internal decompression for lifesaving </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study evaluated our surgical results and gives an analysis of the prognostic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty one consecutive patients with massive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> caused by internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> who underwent external decompression associated with AMTL for lifesaving between June 2000 and December 2005 were included in this retrospective analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Survivors were divided into two functional groups at three months after surgery: good (Barthel index; BI&gt; or =50) and poor (B1&lt;50) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The characteristics of the two groups were compared using statistical analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The patients consisted of 11 males and 10 females aged from 28 to 81 years with a mean age of 65.0+/-11.6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eight patients had an infarction restricted to the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) territory, others had additional anterior cerebral artery (ACA) or posterior cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>) territory infarctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean time between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and operation was 43.5+/-30 hours and ranged from 7 to 148 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two patients died, so the mortality was 9.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Elderly patients (&gt; or =60 years) (P=0.038), high preoperative Japan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> scale (&gt; or =3 digit) (P=0.013), low preoperative Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> scale (GCS&lt;8) (P=0.044), and multiple arterial territory (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>+ACA or <z:chebi fb="20" ids="36751">PCA</z:chebi>) infarction (P=0.045) were significantly associated with poor functional outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: External decompression associated with AMTL can immediately relieve peduncle compression and could be effective in preserving life as effectively as "early" external decompression </plain></SENT>
