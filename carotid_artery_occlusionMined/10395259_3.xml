<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE AND BACKGROUND: Bilateral internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> is an extremely rare entity, therefore, studies of the natural history of this disease are lacking in the English literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study is to analyze the natural history and surgical alternatives for patients with bilateral internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENT POPULATION AND METHODS: Twenty-one patients with bilateral internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> were encountered with a mean age of 61 years (range of 48-73 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Their clinical presentations included eight with hemispheric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo>, three with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100576'>amaurosis fugax</z:hpo>, five with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> and five with non-hemispheric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis was confirmed using carotid duplex ultrasound and angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The majority of patients had more than one risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>: smoking in 100%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo> in 14/21 (67%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in 17/21 (81%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> in 15/21 (71%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> in 7/21 (33%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition to the usual medical treatment, 13 patients underwent surgical intervention: eight had an external carotid endarterectomy, four had a carotid-subclavian bypass (to increase external carotid or vertebral flow for tight stenosis or occlusion of the common carotid or subclavian artery) and one patient had an ascending aorta to innominate artery bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At a mean follow-up of 6 years (range 1-11 years), the overall mortality rates were 11/21 (52%), in the surgical group it was 5/13 (38%) and 6/8 (75%) in the medical group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> included seven <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarctions</z:hpo> (four in the surgical group and three in the medical group) and four <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> (one in the surgical group and three in the medical group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the surgical group, 2/13 (15%) had late neurological deficits (one hemispheric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> and one <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>), in contrast to 6/8 (75%, three <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> and three hemispheric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo>) in the medical group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Bilateral internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusions</z:mp> have grave prognoses and should be considered a marker for severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442893" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">systemic disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Various cerebrovascular reconstructive procedures, if feasible, may be beneficial for some of these patients </plain></SENT>
