<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have provided evidence that PACAP is neuroprotective in several models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000546'>retinal degeneration</z:hpo> in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our previous studies showed that PACAP treatment ameliorated the damaging effects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> hypoperfusion modeled by permanent bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have also demonstrated in earlier studies that treatment with PACAP <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> further aggravates <z:hpo ids='HP_0007863'>retinal lesions</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It has been shown that PACAP deficient mice have larger <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to compare the degree of <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> damage in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> and PACAP deficient mice in ischemic <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mice underwent 10Â min of bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> followed by 2-week reperfusion period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Retinas were then processed for histological analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It was found that PACAP deficient mice had significantly greater <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> damage, as shown by the thickness of the whole retina, the morphometric analysis of the individual <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> layers, and the cell numbers in the inner nuclear and ganglion cell layers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Exogenous PACAP administration could partially protect against <z:hpo ids='HP_0000546'>retinal degeneration</z:hpo> in PACAP deficient mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results clearly show that endogenous PACAP reacts as a stress-response <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> that is necessary for endogenous protection against different <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> insults </plain></SENT>
