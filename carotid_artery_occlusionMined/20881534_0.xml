<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND IMPORTANCE: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> face a significant risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is believed that treatment is indicated if medical therapy fails or even as prophylaxis in high-risk patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Direct surgical repair with carotid endarterectomy has a considerable failure rate and significant associated risks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Indirect repair with an extracranial-to-intracranial bypass has become the mainstay of surgical treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this case study, the authors assess the feasibility of direct endovascular recanalization in the setting of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> carotid occlusion, and discuss technical nuances and indications in comparison with the world literature and alternative options </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL PRESENTATION: Two patients presented with symptomatic, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo>, complete occlusion of the proximal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The duration of documented occlusion exceeded 3 years in one patient and 6 months in the other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Endovascular recanalization was attempted using extracranial and intracranial stenting with proximal protection (flow arrest/reversal) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both patients had an excellent radiographic result, improving from Thrombolysis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral Infarction</z:e> (TICI) grade 0 (no perfusion) to grade 3 (complete perfusion) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The first patient's clinical symptoms resolved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The second patient remained unchanged with a mild facial droop </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These preliminary results show potential for the endovascular management of this complicated disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Long-term results and more data will determine the ultimate place of endovascular recanalization for symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> carotid occlusion among other therapies </plain></SENT>
