<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-one patients (nine male and 32 female patients; age range, 26-75 years; mean age, 54.4 years) underwent treatment at seven centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two patients had dural arteriovenous fistulae of the transverse sinus treated by a transvenous route </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients underwent internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002858'>meningioma</z:hpo>, facial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, or carotid injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One patient underwent occlusion of the basilar artery and one patient underwent occlusion of the vertebral artery for treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In two patients, coils were used as part of the treatment of their <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformations</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, the Detach-18 coils were delivered through a microcatheter with two distal markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two types of coils, a 0.015-inch-diameter "regular" coil and a 0.014-inch-diameter "soft" coil, were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 569 coils were used, 541 of which were detached </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The number of coils in ranged from four to 53 (average number of coils, 14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The coils passed easily through the microcatheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The detachment maneuver occurred within 10 to 25 s with 20 turns of the introducing wire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No premature coil detachment occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Complete occlusion of the vessel lumen was achieved in 35 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In three cases, 80% to 90% occlusion was achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In two cases, 70% to 80% occlusion was achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>There were no device-related complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The detachment system was safe, reliable, consistent, and fast </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>This is a useful system for coil embolization in neurovascular applications </plain></SENT>
