<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It has recently been reported that pretreatment with a single dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> (0.1 mg/kg) 24 hours before <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> in 7-day-old rat pups is protective against an hypoxic-ischemic insult (unilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> followed by 3 hours of <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> in 8% O2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors now examine whether pretreatment 6 hours before insult is equally effective and compare other agents potentially suitable for prophylaxis in neonatal <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, including the calcium <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> flunarizine (30 mg/kg pretreatment), nimodipine (0.5 mg/kg pretreatment), and the 21-aminosteroid U-74389F (10 mg/kg pre- and posttreatment) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For each active agent, there was also a vehicle-treated control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Comparison of the mean area of ipsilateral infarction on brain coronal sections showed that there was no statistically significant difference between the various control groups (mean area of infarction 66% +/- 4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> 6 hours prior to <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> offered complete protection with no infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A beneficial effect was seen following pretreatment with flunarizine (mean area of infarction 33.6% +/- 7.8%), although this degree of damage was still significantly different from that seen with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> pretreatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment with nimodipine or U-74389F offered no protection (mean area of infarction 77.5% +/- 4% and 59% +/- 10%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Unlike findings in adult animals and clinical studies, the current studies show that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> may have a role in the treatment of neonatal <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and deserves reappraisal </plain></SENT>
