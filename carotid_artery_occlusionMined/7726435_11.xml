<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To determine how etomidate and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="102166">thiopental</z:chebi> modulate excitatory transmitter release, their effect on the release of glycine and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was evaluated by microdialysis in the hippocampus and cortex of rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three groups of Wistar-Kyoto rats (n = 5/group) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the etomidate and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="102166">thiopental</z:chebi> groups, electroencephalogram (EEG) burst-suppression was achieved and maintained by a continuous infusion of either etomidate (0.6 mg.kg-1.min-1) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="102166">thiopental</z:chebi> (3 mg.kg-1.min-1) 40 min prior to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Ischemia</z:e> was induced in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three groups by bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> with simultaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> to 35 mm Hg for 10 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pericranial temperature was controlled at 38 degrees C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Dialysate was collected before, during, and after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The levels of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> and glycine in the dialysate were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Within the hippocampus, both <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> and glycine levels increased significantly in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="102166">thiopental</z:chebi> and control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>By contrast, in the etomidate group, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> and glycine levels did not increase during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, and peak levels were significantly less than those in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="102166">thiopental</z:chebi> group </plain></SENT>
