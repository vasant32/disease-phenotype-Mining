<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Continuous i.v drug administration for 3 days, performed with Alzet osmotic minipumps so that to deliver 167 ng.kg-1.min-1 Iloprost, 5 ng.kg-1.min-1 ZK 96480 or their respective vehicle, started 1 hour post-oligemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both compounds which are stable prostacyclin analogues reduced the edematous reaction and the post-oligemic accumulation of calcium in the brain tissue but above <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> they improved, mainly ZK 96480, the learning capacity of injured animals </plain></SENT>
