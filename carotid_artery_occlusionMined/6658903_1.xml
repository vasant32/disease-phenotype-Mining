<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among 212 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with minor neurological deficits, incomplete <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> progressed to complete <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> in 15 patients several days after the beginning of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On admission, 3 had internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, 2 had stenosis of the internal carotid artery, 5 had occlusion of the middle cerebral arterial trunk, 2 had occlusion of the middle cerebral arterial branch, and 3 had no angiographically visible occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The changes between the first and the second angiograms were of different varieties: another recurrent occlusion, progression of occlusion, new occlusion in the cerebral arteries opacified through the collateral pathway, recanalization of the initially occluded artery, and no change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Such different patterns of pathophysiological events show that the mechanism of neurological worsening in infarcted patients is not uniform </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Based on the results from the present study, several problems which arose during the investigation and the somewhat vague definition of "progressing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>" currently in use are discussed </plain></SENT>
