<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (BCAO) of 17 min followed by reperfusion for 24 h was employed to produce <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and reperfusion (I/R) induced cerebral injury in male swiss <z:mp ids='MP_0001189'>albino</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size was measured using triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Memory was assessed using elevated plus maze test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Degree of motor <z:hpo ids='HP_0002311'>incoordination</z:hpo> was evaluated using inclined beam walking test, rota rod test and lateral push test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Digoxin (0.08 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered 24 h before surgery in a separate group of animals to induce PP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>BCAO followed by reperfusion, produced significant rise in cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size along with impairment of memory and motor coordination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Digoxin treatment produced a significant decrease in cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size and reversal of I/R induced impairment of memory and motor <z:hpo ids='HP_0002311'>incoordination</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Digoxin induced neuroprotective effect was abolished significantly by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> (15 mg/kg, i.p.), a L-type <z:chebi fb="1" ids="38215">calcium channel blocker</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34956">ruthenium red</z:chebi> (3 mg/kg, s.c.), an intracellular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8925">ryanodine</z:chebi> receptor blocker and 3,4-dichlorobenzamil (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi>/Ca(2+) exchanger inhibitor) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that digoxin preconditioning exerts a marked neuroprotective effect on the ischemic brain, which is possibly linked to digitalis induced increase in intracellular calcium levels eventually leading to the activation of calcium sensitive signal transduction cascades </plain></SENT>
