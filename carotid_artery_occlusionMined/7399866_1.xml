<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It appears that patients with this angiographic finding can be divided into two distinct clinical groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The first consists of children with a "primary" form of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> that causes alternating <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo>, frequently of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003680'>nonprogressive</z:hpo> nature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The second consists of children and adults with various underlying diseases who develop an "acquired," usually progressive form of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya</z:e> </plain></SENT>
