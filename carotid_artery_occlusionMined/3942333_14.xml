<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The effect of deep <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> anesthesia on ischemically induced neuronal damage was evaluated in the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sixteen mechanically ventilated animals were maintained normocapnic and normothermic while subjected to a near complete forebrain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> insult induced with systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> (MAP = 50 +/- mmHg) and bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Prior to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, eight of the rats received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> by inhalation until the EEG demonstrated a burst suppression pattern; the other eight were untreated controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After 10 min of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, the carotid clamps were removed, blood pressure was restored, and, in the treated group, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> administration discontinued </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Following the ischemic insult, the animals were observed over a 7-day period, at which time they were killed and the brains prepared for histologic study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Severity of damage was assessed by a direct count of irreversibly damaged neurons, which appear bright red when stained with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52815">cresyl violet</z:chebi>-acid fuchsin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Areas of particular interest were those that characteristically display vulnerability to ischemic damage, i.e., hippocampus, caudate nuclei, and neocortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The control group revealed severe damage in the hippocampal CA1 sector (70% cells acidophilic) with more variability in the caudate nuclei and neocortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The treated group showed a similar extent of damage with approximately 74% cells acidophilic in hippocampus (CA1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Clinical appearance was indistinguishable between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The authors conclude that pretreatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> shows no beneficial effects on delayed neuronal <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> following near-complete forebrain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
