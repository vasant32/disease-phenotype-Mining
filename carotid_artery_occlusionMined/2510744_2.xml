<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Transient ischemia</z:e> was produced by bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> for 30 min, which was followed by 60 min of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Propentofylline (1, 2.5 or 30 mg/kg) or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> saline was administered intravenously at 2 min after the reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37971">31P</z:chebi> spectra during the occlusion showed a marked reduction in <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15422">adenosine triphosphate</z:chebi> (ATP) and phosphocreatine (PCr) with elevation of inorganic phosphate (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Pi</z:e>) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The intracellular pH (pHi) calculated from the chemical shift of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Pi</z:e> was markedly reduced in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After the reperfusion, ATP, PCr, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Pi</z:e> and pHi gradually recovered towards the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the 2.5 mg/kg propentofylline group, the energy recovery was significantly faster than in the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cerebral water content measured at the end of reperfusion was significantly lower in the 2.5 mg/kg propentofylline group than in the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, such cerebral protective effects were not observed in the 1 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The present results suggest that propentofylline may accelerate the energy recovery of the transiently ischemic brain and suppress the development of post-ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The effects, however, were not dose-dependent in manner </plain></SENT>
