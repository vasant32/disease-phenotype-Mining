<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: A few studies have observed reduced vascular reserve measured by single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography (SPECT) to be a risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in patients with carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, but stenosis has been excluded from these former studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study has evaluated the prognosis of reduced vascular reserve in patients with stenosis, and the effect of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) on these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty patients diagnosed as having &gt;70% stenosis of the carotid artery at the University of Tokyo Hospital, between 2001 and 2004, underwent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi>-stress SPECT test first </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A resting SPECT study was performed on a different day from the stressed SPECT study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients were grouped as having reduced vascular reserve or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> vascular reserve from the SPECT results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analysis of risk factors and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-free curve analysis for reduced vascular reserve was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 40 patients, 24 (60%) had reduced vascular reserve and 18 underwent CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up period was 21.5+/-15.5 months (mean+/-SD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Four <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> occurred during follow-up: in 1 patient with CEA and 3 without CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients had reduced vascular reserve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The patients with reduced vascular reserve without any surgery had a significantly lower <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-free rate compared with those with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> vascular reserve or reduced vascular reserve, but also receiving CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We propose performing SPECT tests in patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> regardless of symptoms, and performing CEA on those with a reduction in vascular reserve </plain></SENT>
