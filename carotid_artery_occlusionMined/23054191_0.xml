<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent studies suggest that disturbed blood flow-induced shear stress can induce <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> (ATH) in humans and animals without a high fat diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we hypothesize that partial ligation of the left carotid artery can generate disturbed blood flow and shear stress and would lead to ATH in a predisposed genetic model of Apo E(-/-) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The partial left carotid artery model was generated by ligating three out of four branches of the left carotid artery compared with controls which experienced similar surgery conditions but no ligation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Animals were sacrificed 2 weeks post-ligation and examined for plaque formation, infiltration of leukocytes, pro-inflammatory immune response, and blood flow velocity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest a significant (p &lt; 0.05) increase in plaque formation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_42'>lipid deposition</z:mpath> in the partial ligated animals compared with controls, confirmed with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin and oil red O staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, there was a significant (p &lt; 0.05) increase in the number of M1 macrophages and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-6 and TNFÎ±, as compared with the control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, partial ligated carotid arteries demonstrated disturbed blood flow as their systolic velocity was significantly reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our data suggest that partial ligation of the left carotid artery induces disturbed flow and shear stress in the predisposed genetic model of Apo E(-/-) mice and leads to significantly developed ATH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Similarities to clinical patients who develop ATH independent of a high fat diet show that this could be a potential animal model to examine various parameters in ATH </plain></SENT>
