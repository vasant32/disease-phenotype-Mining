<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, which was studied as an experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model, was induced in 3- and 24-month-old rats by unilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> associated with 24 h of <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eight metabolites were quantified from extracts in three different brain regions (hippocampus, frontoparietal and occipital cortices) from both the ipsilateral and contralateral sides </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our findings showed significant differences in <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17268">myo-inositol</z:chebi> concentration values in the hippocampus of the aged rats as compared to the same area of the young adult group under normoxic conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (HI), the most relevant changes in metabolite concentrations were found in the hippocampal region of both young and aged groups as compared to their age-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the three brain areas under investigation, the hippocampus proved to be particularly susceptible to the prolonged <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> perturbation </plain></SENT>
