<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Occlusion of the common carotid artery (CCA) is generally associated with occlusion of the ipsilateral internal carotid artery (ICA) and external carotid artery (ECA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Occasionally, however, collateral circulation to the ECA may preserve patency of the ICA via retrograde perfusion through the bulb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These patients may suffer ongoing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> and risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recognition of this pathologic variant may allow for effective surgical intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We have performed seven operations in six patients with occluded CCAs and patent ECA and ICAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The occluded CCA was on the left side in each case (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Six of the operations were performed for ischemic symptoms, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0100576'>amaurosis fugax</z:hpo> in five patients, hemispheric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> in one patient, and profound global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in two patients who had concomitant occlusions of other extracranial vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the five most recent cases the patent ECA and ICA above the occluded CCA were recognized by preoperative duplex scanning, which prompted cerebral angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A variety of reconstructive procedures were used, depending on the pathologic <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These procedures included subclavian or axillary artery to carotid artery bypass with carotid endarterectomy (five), carotid endarterectomy with thrombectomy of the proximal CCA (one), and ascending aorta to carotid artery bypass (one) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> associated with the surgery, although one patient had transient neurologic symptoms and a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> associated with documented reperfusion <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Three of the patients had preoperative and postoperative transcranial Doppler studies that documented significant improvement in intracranial hemodynamics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Five of the patients have had continuously patent grafts with relief of symptoms for an average of 40 months (range 3 to 155 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The remaining patient had graft occlusion after 72 months and underwent repeat operation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100576'>amaurosis fugax</z:hpo> and global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>His second graft remains patent, and he is symptom free 21 months later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Recognition of patent distal vessels above a CCA occlusion depends on a high index of suspicion, careful investigation of the carotid bulb with duplex scanning, and delayed arteriographic views of the bulb allowing for late collateral vessel filling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The favorable results in this small series of patients supports an aggressive surgical approach when patients with symptoms are encountered with patent distal vessels above an occluded CCA </plain></SENT>
