<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To document the anatomic response to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> occlusion of vessels supplying the head, patterns of collateral vessel growth and development were studied by corrosion casting in adult mongrel dogs 8 weeks after bilateral ligation of the common carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Dissection of the casts revealed two consistent and bilateral anastomotic connections: (i) internal carotid artery to maxillary artery (anastomotic artery) and (ii) internal carotid artery to ascending pharyngeal artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Also present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the casts was a connection between one common carotid artery and both vertebral arteries, which has been designated as the deep collateral vessel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Significant collateral connections did not occur between the orbital vessels or between analogous vessels of the right and the left sides </plain></SENT>
