<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients but one were followed up, for five to 46 months (mean, 20 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were no operative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> or complications and no late <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One patient (7.7%) required early extracranial-intracranial (EC-IC) bypass for failure of the external carotid artery endarterectomy to relieve the initial symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> remaining patients were completely (n = 9) or partially (n = 2) relieved of symptoms, and EC-IC bypass was not required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no criteria identified by either oculopneumoplethysmography or angiography that could reliably predict the need for subsequent EC-IC bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ninety-two percent of the patients were adequately treated with external carotid artery revascularization alone, suggesting that subsequent EC-IC bypass is seldom required in patients with ipsilateral internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and external carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
