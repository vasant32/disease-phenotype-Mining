<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Animals were subjected to 1 or 2 h <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Then the concentrations of substances were measured in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus and striatum and compared with control values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Due to the incomplete <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, ATP showed a moderate decrease, while <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi> increased remarkably, and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi> underwent a moderate increase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With regard to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25375">monoamines</z:chebi>, both <z:chebi fb="15" ids="33569">noradrenaline</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> levels were reduced in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, whereas <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> levels increased in the hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="25375">monoamine</z:chebi> metabolites, i.e. metabolites by <z:chebi fb="3" ids="25375">monoamine</z:chebi> oxidase (MAO), metabolites by <z:chebi fb="5" ids="18135">catechol</z:chebi>-O-methyltransferase (COMT), and metabolites by both MAO and COMT, underwent increases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 3-methoxytyramine level in particular showed marked increases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore levels of precursor amino acids as well as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28171">5-hydroxytryptophan</z:chebi> rose </plain></SENT>
