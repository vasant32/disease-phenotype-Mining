<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To review patients who have presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> from a middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in whom in addition to the middle cerebral artery thromboembolus, an internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> has been present, and in whom angioplasty of these totally occluded internal carotid arteries has bee n successful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed retrospectively our experience in treating a cute <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with intracranial, intraarterial urokinase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Six of 27 patients had internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusions</z:mp> in addition to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusions</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two patients presented with spontaneous carotid dissections for wh ich no further intervention from the ipsilateral internal carotid artery was attempted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the remaining four internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusions</z:mp> secondary to atherosclerotic disease, standard guide wires and catheters were negotiated across the level of the internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, which expedited intracranial catheterization for thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, angioplasty of the internal carotid artery was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> four occluded internal carotid arteries could be traversed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No new neurologic deficits occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No vascular injuries occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Four- to 6-month follow-up showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four internal carotid arteries remained patent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> occlusions of the internal carotid artery from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, the occluded vessel can sometimes be recanalized with low morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In addition, endovascular access to the intracranial circulation can be expedited by using the recanalized internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
