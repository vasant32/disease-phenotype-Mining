<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The effectiveness of defibrotide, a single-stranded polydeoxyribonucleotide compound, in preventing damage caused by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was induced in anesthetized gerbils by bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> for 10 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Defibrotide (100 mg/kg) or saline was injected, i.v., immediately after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The following parameters were evaluated simultaneously: (1) electroencephalographic (EEG) spectral power, recorded before, during and after the ischemic period; (2) body temperature, monitored with a rectal thermistor probe after reperfusion for 120 min; (3) spontaneous motility, evaluated through a photocell system and quantified in terms of total distance travelled in 30 min, 1 h after recirculation and at periods over 15 days; (4) mnemonic functions assessed by passive avoidance test from 3 to 15 days after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>; (5) histological examination, 7 days after reperfusion, counting CA1 hippocampal neuronal cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced complete flattening of spectral power was significantly reversed (P &lt; 0.01) by post-ischemic treatment with defibrotide between 30 and 90 min after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A complete recovery of total EEG spectral power was seen in the defibrotide group at 6 h and the saline ischemic group at 1 day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seven days after bilateral carotid occlusion, there was a significant decrease in spectral power (-70% +/- 6) together with a loss of the number of CA1 cells in the saline ischemic group (-64%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment with defibrotide significantly protected against the decrease in spectral power (-30% +/- 7) and cell loss (-9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, the number of animals found to be protected against the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced flattening was significantly larger for defibrotide-treated gerbils than for saline-treated animals throughout the experiment except for the third day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Body temperature was significantly decreased only at 30 min after reperfusion in both ischemic and sham-operated groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Defibrotide reduced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced hypermotility but only 6 h after the insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced impairment of memory was partially reversed within 3 days in the defibrotide-treated animals and fully reversed within 7 days in the defibrotide group and 15 days in the saline group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrate that defibrotide, even when administered after the post-ischemic period, possesses anti-ischemic properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The mechanism by which defibrotide protects the ischemic reperfused brain is still largely unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>However, a neuroprotection via <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> A1 and A2 subtype receptor interaction can be put forward </plain></SENT>
