<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Quantitative measurement of blood flow volume in the common carotid artery (CCA) is now possible using the color velocity imaging quantification (CVI-Q) ultrasound technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the cerebral hemodynamic effects of unilateral internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion on CCA blood flow volumes (FVs) using CVI-Q </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Records of ultrasound studies in our neurosonology laboratory were retrospectively reviewed to identify patients with unilateral ICA occlusions who at a minimum received both a routine color duplex carotid ultrasound examination and quantitative measurement of FV in the CCA, bilaterally, using the CVI-Q method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 71 patients met criteria and were included in the cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A side to side comparison was performed for FV, peak systolic velocities (PSV), end-diastolic velocities (EDV), and resistance indices (RIs) in the CCA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results correlated with any other available data such as flow direction in the ophthalmic artery and the presence of intracranial collateralization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The FV, PSV, and EDV were significantly reduced, and the RI was significantly increased in the CCA on the side of the occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A subgroup analysis in patients who also had an examination of the ophthalmic (n = 61) and the intracranial arteries of the Circle of Willis (n = 50), showed significantly higher FV in the CCA on the side of the occlusion if there was also reversed flow in the ophthalmic artery on the side of the occlusion (344 +/- 144 ml/min versus 169 +/- 53 ml/min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Quantitative FV measurement using CVI-Q ultrasound can identify clear alterations in volume flow, collateral pathways, and cerebral hemodynamics in patients with unilateral ICA occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is a complementary tool, providing additional objective information about the cerebral hemodynamic effects of ICA occlusion that goes beyond what is available using routine flow velocity data </plain></SENT>
