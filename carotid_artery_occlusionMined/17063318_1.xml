<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The aim of the present study was to assess the regional variation in cerebral perfusion, vasomotor reactivity (VMR) and the role of cerebral collaterals in patients with symptomatic internal carotid artery (ICA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventeen functionally independent patients (60+/-9 years, mean+/-SD) with a unilateral symptomatic internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and a &lt;30% contralateral ICA stenosis were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>(99 m) Tc-hexamethyl propyleneamine <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25750">oxime</z:chebi> (HMPAO) single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography (SPECT) was performed to study cerebral blood flow in rest and during a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16526">CO(2)</z:chebi> challenge in the cerebellum, temporal lobe, occipital lobe, basal ganglia, frontal lobe and parietal lobe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Time of flight and phase contrast MRA were used to study collateral flow via circle of Willis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In rest, cerebral perfusion on the side ipsilateral to the ICA occlusion was decreased compared with the contralateral side in the basal ganglia (p&lt;0.05), frontal lobe (p&lt;0.01) and parietal lobe (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16526">CO(2)</z:chebi> challenge only the ipsilateral frontal lobe demonstrated a perfusion decrease compared with the contralateral frontal lobe (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in patients without collateral flow via the anterior circle of Willis the perfusion of the ipsilateral frontal lobe was significantly decreased (p&lt;0.01) during the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16526">CO(2)</z:chebi> challenge and crossed cerebellar diaschisis with a decreased perfusion on the contralateral cerebellar hemisphere was detected (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No cerebral blood flow (CBF) differences were found for present/absent collateral flow via the posterior communicating artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Regional assessment of cerebral perfusion and VMR with SPECT demonstrated the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of cerebral hemodynamics and the importance of collateral flow via the anterior circle of Willis </plain></SENT>
