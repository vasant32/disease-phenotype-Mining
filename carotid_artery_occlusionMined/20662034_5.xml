<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The precise mechanisms by which blood flow is controlled by NIR laser irradiation on the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>) have not been elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined the effect of 808 nm laser diode irradiation on CBF in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS: We examined the effect of NIR irradiation on CBF at three different power densities (0.8, 1.6 and 3.2 W/cm(2)) and directly measured nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) in brain tissue during NIR laser irradiation using an amperometric NO-selective electrode </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also examined the contribution of NO and a neurotransmitter, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>, to the regulation of CBF by using a nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (NOS) inhibitor, N(g)-<z:chebi fb="13" ids="29785">nitro</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-arginine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">ester</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi> (L-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NAME</z:e>), and an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">N-methyl-D-aspartate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi>) receptor blocker, MK-801, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We examined the change in brain tissue temperature during NIR laser irradiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We also investigated the protection effect of NIR laser irradiation on transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> using transient bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (BCCAO) in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We showed that NIR laser irradiation (1.6 W/cm(2) for 15-45 minutes) increased local CBF by 30% compared to that in control mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>NIR laser irradiation also induced a significant increase in cerebral NO concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In mice that received L-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NAME</z:e>, NIR laser irradiation did not induce any increase in CBF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mice administered MK-801 showed an immediate increase but did not show a delayed additional increase in local CBF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The increase in brain tissue temperature induced by laser irradiation was estimated to be as low as 0.8 degrees C at 1.6 W/cm(2), indicating that the heating effect is not a main mechanism of the CBF increase in this condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment with NIR laser irradiation improved residual CBF and reduced the numbers of apoptotic cells in the hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that NIR laser irradiation is a promising experimental and therapeutic tool in the field of cerebral circulation research </plain></SENT>
