<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite the growing amount of case reports, most pathogenic, phenotypic, and prognostic aspects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002324'>hydranencephaly</z:hpo> remain controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By matching the recent literature data with the findings of our own series (four cases: two fetuses at the twelfth gestational week, a 32-year-old man, and a 14-year-old female), we attempted to date back the insult leading to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002324'>hydranencephaly</z:hpo> to understand its pathogenesis and to explain the basis of its protean phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The variable detection of cerebral remnants seems to mirror the developmental pathway of cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, fetal and postnatal neuroimaging data and histopathologic findings point toward an early bilateral internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, mostly occurring between the eighth and twelfth gestational weeks, as the main pathogenic mechanism of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002324'>hydranencephaly</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
