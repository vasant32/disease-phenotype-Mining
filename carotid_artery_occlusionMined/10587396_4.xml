<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Revascularization of the internal or external carotid arteries is occasionally indicated for symptomatic atherosclerotic common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> or long-segment high-grade stenosis beginning at its origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>I report the outcome of axillary artery-based bypass grafts to the distal common, internal, or external carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between 1981 and 1997, 29 axillary-to-carotid bypass grafting procedures were performed on 28 patients, 15 men and 13 women, with a mean age of 68 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Indications were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">transient ischemia</z:e> in nine patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100576'>amaurosis fugax</z:hpo> in four patients, completed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in six patients, and nonlateralizing global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in nine patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three common carotid arteries were totally occluded, and six had long-segment stenosis of 90% or greater beginning at the origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Saphenous vein grafts were used in 25 procedures, and synthetic grafts were used in four </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Grafts were placed to 13 internal, eight distal common, and eight external carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>; one <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> occurred (3.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No lymphatic or peripheral nerve complications occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In a 1- to 11-year follow-up period (mean, 4.5 years), there were no graft occlusions, one restenosis of 50% or greater, and two restenoses of 70% or greater </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The 1-year stenosis-free rate for 50% or greater stenosis was 93%, and the 5- and 10-year rates were 87% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No late ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The 5- and 10-year survival rates were 64% and 28%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>Coronary artery disease</z:hpo> was the major cause of late mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Axillary-to-carotid bypass grafting for severe symptomatic common carotid occlusive disease is safe, well tolerated, durable, and effective in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> prevention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>There is a high late mortality rate because of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> in patients with severe proximal common carotid occlusive disease </plain></SENT>
