<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe a hybrid technique whereby a patient was treated with eversion carotid bifurcation endarterectomy, fluoroscopically guided retrograde ring-stripper common carotid endarterectomy, and stenting of residual stenosis in the disobliterated artery </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient remains asymptomatic with a radiographically patent reconstruction at 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This combination of endovascular and open surgery enables the surgeon to address long occlusions of the common carotid arteries with control of the distal and proximal endarterectomy margins and obviates the need for general anesthesia or sternotomy </plain></SENT>
