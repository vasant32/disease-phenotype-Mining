<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients presenting with symptomatic extracranial internal carotid artery near occlusion who underwent endovascular recanalization between October 2004 and July 2005 were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During these procedures, a 9-French Concentric Balloon Guide Catheter (Concentric Medical, Mountain View, CA) was advanced into the common carotid artery proximal to the site of occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During the prestent angioplasty of the lesion, the proximal balloon was inflated and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After initial angioplasty and before stent placement, a distal filter protection device was placed in the distal internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Stent placement and repeat angioplasty were performed with both protection devices active </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were placed on dual antiplatelet therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were four patients treated with a mean age of 74 years; three of these four patients were men </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and carotid occlusion or near occlusion on noninvasive imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three right internal carotid arteries were treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were successfully recanalized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No procedurally related complications or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This series demonstrates the feasibility of recanalization of symptomatic carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> or near occlusion using proximal and distal emboli protection devices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Such an approach may provide an added level of safety during carotid recanalization procedures </plain></SENT>
