<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This 43-year-old man underwent a right-sided CEA for an asymptomatic 80% CA stenosis detected using duplex ultrasound testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patient experienced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> and possibly a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> intraoperatively and a left <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> immediately postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>He was referred to the authors' institution for consideration of emergency coronary intervention and evaluation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A computerized tomography scan of the head demonstrated subtle early ischemic changes in the right posterior parietal region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cerebral angiography revealed occlusion of the right common CA (CCA) at the CA bifurcation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two coronary stents (Magic Wall; Boston Scientific Scimed, Maple Grove, MN) were placed in tandem in the right CCA and internal CA (ICA), overlapping at the proximal cervical ICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Complete recanalization of the CA was achieved, and the patient made a clinically significant recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic angiography can provide important information about CA and intracranial circulation that will aid in the evaluation of postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> after CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Stent placement should be considered as an alternative method of treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> CA occlusion or dissection following CEA </plain></SENT>
