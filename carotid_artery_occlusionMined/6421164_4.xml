<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To develop an animal model for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> suitable for studying the <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> sequelae of this disease, we performed bilateral and unilateral common carotid artery ligations on mature pigmented rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Bilateral ligation consistently resulted in a characteristic pathologic <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> appearance, paralleling the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000488'>retinopathy</z:hpo> of carotid artery occlusive disease in humans, demonstrated by fundus photography and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi> angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Any abnormalities found in the rats with unilateral ligations were inconsistent and less severe, although <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi> angiography proved to be more sensitive than ophthalmoscopy for detecting these subtle changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pepsin-trypsin <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> digests disclosed extensive disruption of the microvasculature in the eyes of bilaterally ligated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This model should prove to be useful in examining the reversibility of the ocular findings as well as evaluating central <z:mp ids='MP_0000768'>nervous system abnormalities</z:mp> after carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
