<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate the risk of temporary or permanent internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 156 patients intraarterial balloon test occlusion in combination with a stable <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi>-enhanced CT cerebral blood flow study was performed before radiologic or surgical treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 156 patients passed the clinical balloon test occlusion and underwent a <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi> study in combination with a second balloon test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Quantitative flow data were analyzed for absolute changes as well as changes in symmetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fourteen patients exhibited reduced flow values between 20 and 30 mL/100 g per minute, an absolute decrease in flow, and significant asymmetry in the middle cerebral artery territory during balloon test occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These patients would be considered at high risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> if internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> were to be performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With one exception they belonged to a group (class I) of 61 patients who showed bilateral or ipsilateral flow decrease and significant asymmetry with lower flow on the side of occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The other 95 patients, who showed a variety of cerebral blood flow response patterns including ipsilateral or bilateral flow increase, were at moderate (class II) or low (class III) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast to these findings, exclusively qualitative flow analysis failed to identify the patients at high risk: a threshold with an asymmetry index of 10% revealed only 16% specificity whereas an asymmetry index of 45% showed only 61% sensitivity for detection of low flow areas (&lt; 30 mL/100 g per minute) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: For achieving a minimal hemodynamic related-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate associated with permanent clinical internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> we suggest integration of a thorough analysis of quantitative cerebral blood flow data before and during balloon test occlusion </plain></SENT>
