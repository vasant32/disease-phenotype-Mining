<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Conventional spasmolysis with papaverine yields a generally poor outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We believe that arterial infusion of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi> may offer a better outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the outcome of patients treated with either papaverine or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi> infusion for vasospasm during embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 14 patients undergoing <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysm</z:hpo> embolization had a ICA occlusive vasospasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among the 8 patients who received conventional treatment with papaverine the vasospasm improved partially in 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 3 cases, treatment was ineffective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>6 of the patients died within 3 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>2 patients developed hemispheric infarction and underwent a decompressive craniectomy and subtotal resection of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>; 1 of these 2 patients died after 4 months and the other was severely disabled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the 6 patients treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi>, spasmolysis and subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> treatment was succesful in 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In 1 patient who had preoperative stenosis of the carotid artery proximal to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> spasmolysis failed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: ICA occlusive spasm is an extremely serious and often lethal complication in embolization of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Conventional treatment with papaverine has a poor outcome, whereas arterial infusion of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi> may achieve better results </plain></SENT>
