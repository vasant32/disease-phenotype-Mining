<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report our experience in endovascular recanalization of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with ICA occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND TECHNIQUES: We reviewed our registry for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients treated with ET who had (1) ICA occlusion by digital subtraction angiography (thrombolysis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">myocardial ischemia</z:e>=0) with location of type II (above ophthalmic artery involving M1 or A1 but not both) or type III (proximal to the ophthalmic artery but distal to the bifurcation); (2) <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> symptoms from the index lesion presenting 3 hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms; (3) minimal ischemic changes on brain CT scan (less than one third of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory); (4) attempted ET </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neuroradiologists reviewed angiograms for thrombolysis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A blinded vascular neurologist reviewed post-procedural brain imaging for Alberta <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Program Early CT (ASPECT) scoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Outcome scales were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified 14 patients, 10 of whom were men (mean age, 58 +/- 14 years; median age, 54 years; age range, 40-74 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were 8 left ICA occlusions, 3 type II; and 6 right ICA occlusions, one type II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Median baseline National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale score was 17 (range, 11-25; mean, 18 +/- 4.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean time to ET was 389 +/- 103 minutes (median, 306 minutes; range, 197-1290 minutes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Immediate recanalization occurred in 64% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Decrease in expected <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> volume by brain imaging occurred in 50% with mean ASPECT score of 4 +/- 2.9 (median, 3; range, 0-8; 21% &gt; or = 8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Two <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> occurred, one symptomatic; 3 patients died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Good outcome was achieved in 64% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Endovascular therapy of carotid occlusion in hyperacute <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients is feasible and may help to reduce <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> volume and increase good outcome in some patients </plain></SENT>
