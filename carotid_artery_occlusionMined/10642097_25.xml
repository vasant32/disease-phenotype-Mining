<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Quantitative, multislice dynamic susceptibility contrast-enhanced MRI perfusion measurements were used to determine the patterns of cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume (CBV), mean transit time (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi>), and normalized first moment of the tissue deltaR2-time curve (N) in 11 subjects with carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> or stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> correlated with degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo>, whereas a range of alterations in CBF and CBV were found presumably reflecting variables degrees of collateral flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There was no significant correlation between MRI and SPET flow perfusion measurements, with increasing disparity between the two techniques at higher inter-hemispheric flow ratios </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effect of obtaining the arterial input function (AIF) from the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) ipsilateral or contralateral to the stenosis was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Despite the use of an AIF from the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>, which is distal to the circle of Willis, and hence the major sources of collateral supply, there was still some extra dispersion of the contrast agent bolus due to differences in arrival time </plain></SENT>
