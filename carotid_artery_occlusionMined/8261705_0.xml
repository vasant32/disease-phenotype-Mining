<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite the acquired left common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, there was no demonstrable neurologic deficits that would occur by the involvement of the area supplied by the occluded carotid system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cerebral angiography revealed, in addition to efficient collateral circulation from the contralateral carotid system through the anterior communicating artery, a collateral channel from the left vertebral artery to the ipsilateral external carotid artery via the proatlantal intersegmental artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These collateral circulations were indicated to be important in prevention of possible grave neurologic consequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The proatlantal intersegmental artery, though rarely visualized by ordinary cerebral angiographic procedures, was thus demonstrated to be capable of serving as a collateral channel of potential usefulness in the event of severe intracranial hemodynamic alterations, including acquired common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
