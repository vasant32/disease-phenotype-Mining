<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have used continuous-wave (CW) and frequency-domain spectroscopy to investigate the optical properties of the newborn piglet brain in vivo and non-invasively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three anaesthetized, intubated, ventilated and instrumented newborn piglets were placed into a stereotaxic instrument for optimal experimental stability, reproducible probe-to-scalp optical contact and 3D adjustment of the optical probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By measuring the absolute values of the brain absorption and reduced scattering coefficients at two wavelengths (758 and 830 nm), frequency-domain spectroscopy provided absolute readings (in contrast to the relative readings of CW spectroscopy) of cerebral <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> concentration and saturation during experimentally induced perturbations in cerebral haemodynamics and oxygenation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Such perturbations included a modulation of the inspired oxygen concentration, transient brain asphyxia, carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and terminal brain asphyxia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The baseline cerebral <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> saturation and concentration, measured with frequency-domain spectroscopy, were about 60% and 42 microM respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cerebral saturation values ranged from a minimum of 17% (during transient brain asphyxia) to a maximum of 80% (during recovery from transient brain asphyxia) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To analyse the CW optical data, we have (a) derived a mathematical relationship between the cerebral optical properties and the differential pathlength factor and (b) introduced a method based on the spatial dependence of the detected intensity (dc slope method) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The analysis of the cerebral optical signals associated with the arterial pulse and with respiration demonstrates that motion artefacts can significantly affect the intensity recorded from a single optode pair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Motion artefacts can be strongly reduced by combining data from multiple optodes to provide relative readings in the dc slope method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We also report significant biphasic changes (initial decrease and successive increase) in the reduced scattering coefficient measured in the brain after the piglet had been sacrificed </plain></SENT>
