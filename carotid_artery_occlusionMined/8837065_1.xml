<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to address this difficulty, the authors have created a computer model of the cerebral circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This model features individualized simulations of the Circle of Willis and its afferent and efferent branches which can predict changes in flow that will occur during internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the flow predictions suggests that in patients with a symmetric Circle of Willis the anterior communicating artery is the major conduit of collateral blood supply </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In patients with a small anterior communicating artery, the posterior communicating arteries become more important as sources of collateral flow, but they cannot supply as much flow as in the case of a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> anterior communicating artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity studies show that changes in the dimensions of each artery affect the flow throughout the system, such that the arteries in the cerebral circulation must be analyzed as a network rather than as isolated elements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This computer model of the cerebral circulation may help clinicians predict the adequacy of collateral blood supply in patients who undergo internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
