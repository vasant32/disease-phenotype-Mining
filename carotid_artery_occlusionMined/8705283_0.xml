<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Paraffin sections were stained with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52815">cresyl-violet</z:chebi> and marked by their binding of Concanavalin A (Con A) labelled with peroxidase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The degeneration and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo> was observed only in CA1 sectors in almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> experimental groups, whereas the decreased binding of Con A by the neurons of CA1 sector corresponded to the intensity of histologic changes but appeared also only in this sector even without any histological changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These observation can point at the subthreshold damage of CA1 neurons as result of either diminished supply or increased metabolism of d-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, or diminished number of Con A receptors or changes of their specificity after ischemic period </plain></SENT>
