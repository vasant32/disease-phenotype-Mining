<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 157 carotid arteries were available for comparison </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The overall diagnostic accuracy of ICA occlusion by duplex scanning was 96% (sensitivity, 83%; specificity, 98%; positive predictive value, 91%), by ophthalmic flow examination, 95% (sensitivity, 79%; specificity, 98%; positive predictive value 86%), and by combined study, 98% (sensitivity, 96%; specificity, 98%; positive predictive value 92%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We recommend that the ophthalmic flow examination should be used in combination with other sonographic methods in detecting extracranial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The combined study gives higher diagnostic accuracy than the single method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When an occlusion or a tight stenosis is uncertain on carotid sonograms, color Doppler or angiography is indicated for further confirmation </plain></SENT>
