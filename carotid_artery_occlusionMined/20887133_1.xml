<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: In addition to difficulties with <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anesthetic</z:chebi> and medical management, transsphenoidal operations in patients with longstanding <z:hpo ids='HP_0000845'>acromegaly</z:hpo> are associated with inherent intraoperative challenges because of anatomical variations that occur frequently in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The object of this study was to review the overall safety profile and anatomical/technical challenges associated with transsphenoidal surgery in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000845'>acromegaly</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The authors performed a retrospective analysis of 169 patients who underwent endoscopic transsphenoidal operations for growth hormone-secreting <z:mpath ids='MPATH_270'>adenomas</z:mpath> to assess the incidence of surgical complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A review of frequently occurring anatomical challenges and operative strategies employed during each phase of the operation to address these particular issues was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 169 cases reviewed, there was no perioperative mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Internal carotid artery injury occurred in 1 patient (0.6%) with complex sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp>, who remained neurologically intact following endovascular unilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Other complications included: significant postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0000421'>epistaxis</z:hpo> (5 patients [3%]), transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0000873'>diabetes insipidus</z:hpo> (5 patients [3%]), delayed symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002902'>hyponatremia</z:hpo> (4 patients [2%]), CSF leak (2 patients [1%]), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001733'>pancreatitis</z:hpo> (1 patient [0.6%]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Preoperative considerations in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000845'>acromegaly</z:hpo> should include a cardiopulmonary evaluation and planning regarding intubation and other aspects of the <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anesthetic</z:chebi> technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During the nasal phase of the transsphenoidal operation, primary challenges include maintaining adequate visualization and hemostasis, which is frequently compromised by redundant, edematous nasal mucosa and bony <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> of the septum and the nasal turbinates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>During the sphenoid phase, adequate bony removal, optimization of working space, and correlation of imaging studies to intraoperative <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> are major priorities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The sellar phase is frequently challenged by increased sellar floor thickness, distinct patterns of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> extension and bony invasion, and anatomical variations in the caliber and course of the internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Specific operative techniques for addressing each of these intraoperative challenges are discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Transsphenoidal surgery in patients with longstanding <z:hpo ids='HP_0000845'>acromegaly</z:hpo> frequently poses greater challenges than operations for other types of sellar lesions, yet these challenges may be safely and effectively overcome with the anticipation of specific issues and implementation of various intraoperative techniques </plain></SENT>
