<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To investigate the metabolism of the endogenous excitotoxin, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16675">quinolinic acid</z:chebi>, and its potential for mediating cell loss following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, the concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16675">quinolinic acid</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16828,29954">L-tryptophan</z:chebi>, 5-hydroxytryptamine, and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid were quantified in gerbil brain regions at different times after 5 or 15 min of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> induced by bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Significant elevation of brain tryptophan levels, accompanied by increased 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid concentrations, occurred during the first several hours of recirculation, but regional brain <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16675">quinolinic acid</z:chebi> concentrations were found either to decrease or remain unchanged during the first 24 h after the ischemic insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, significant increases in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16675">quinolinic acid</z:chebi> concentrations occurred in striatum and hippocampus at 2 days of recirculation after 5 min of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After a further 4 and 7 days, strikingly large increases in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16675">quinolinic acid</z:chebi> concentrations were observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> regions examined, with the highest levels observed in the hippocampus and striatum, regions that also show the most severe ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These delayed increases in brain <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16675">quinolinic acid</z:chebi> concentrations are suggested to reflect the presence of activated macrophages, reactive astrocytes, and/or microglia in vulnerable regions during and subsequent to ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>While the results do not support a role for increased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16675">quinolinic acid</z:chebi> concentrations in early excitotoxic neuronal damage, the role of the delayed increases in brain <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16675">quinolinic acid</z:chebi> in the progression of postischemic injury and its relevance to postischemic brain function remain to be established </plain></SENT>
