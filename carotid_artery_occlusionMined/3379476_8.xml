<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Between 1974 and 1982, an anastomosis between a pedicle of the superficial temporal artery (STA) and a cortical branch of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) was performed in 163 carotid systems in 157 patients for internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in whom postoperative angiograms were available for analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The angiographic opacification of the arterial system was correlated with the patient's preoperative neurological function and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>From this analysis, the following observations were made: 1) 96% of bypasses were patent; 2) 80% of bypasses achieved a high or medium <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> filling score; 3) there was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> of the STA in 70% of the cases; 4) greater bypass filling occurred in hemispheres with nonvisualized preoperative collateral circulation than in those with readily visualized collateral flow; 5) a meaningful correlation between angiographically assessed postoperative bypass function and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate was not possible because only four patients suffered an ipsilateral hemispheric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the 8-year follow-up period; and 6) patients who were neurologically unstable before the procedure were at greatest risk for a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is apparent that objective analysis of the effectiveness of an STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> bypass, or any other form of extracranial bypass, must await the development of new diagnostic studies in which high-resolution three-dimensional quantification of cerebral blood flow is possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These studies will necessarily be correlated with preoperative and follow-up clinical data </plain></SENT>
