<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) is an important regulator of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We showed previously that NF-kappaB inhibition by intraperitoneal TAT-NBD treatment strongly reduced neonatal hypoxic-ischemic (HI) brain damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neuroprotection by TAT-NBD was not associated with inhibition of cerebral cytokine production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated how <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) production is maintained after NF-kappaB inhibition and whether TNF-alpha contributes to brain damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Postnatal Day 7 rats were subjected to unilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rats were treated immediately after HI with TAT-NBD, the JNK inhibitor TAT-JBD, and/or the TNF-alpha inhibitor etanercept </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We determined brain damage, NF-kappaB and AP-1 activity, Gadd45beta, XIAP, (P-)TAK1, TNF-alpha, and TNF receptor expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Our data confirm that TAT-NBD treatment reduces brain damage without inhibiting TNF-alpha production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We now show that TAT-NBD treatment increased HI-induced AP-1 activation concomitantly with reduced Gadd45beta, XIAP, and increased (P)-TAK1 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Combined inhibition of NF-kappaB and JNK/AP-1 abrogated HI-induced TNF-alpha production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, this treatment reduced the neuroprotective effect of NF-kappaB inhibition alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We show that etanercept was detectable in the HI brain after intraperitoneal administration and that etanercept treatment also reduced the neuroprotective effect of NF-kappaB inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Finally, NF-kappaB inhibition decreased HI-induced upregulation of TNF-R1 and increased TNF-R2 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: When NF-kappaB was inhibited after neonatal cerebral HI, JNK/AP-1 activity was increased and required for increased TNF-alpha expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Our data indicate that the switch to JNK/AP-1 activation preserves HI-induced TNF-alpha expression and thereby might contribute to the neuroprotective effect of TAT-NBD possibly through a TNF-R2 dependent mechanism </plain></SENT>
