<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ligation of the carotid artery produced little change in the ipsilateral cerebral blood flow, but decreased the choroidal blood flow by 16-24% and the blood flow of the inferior rectus muscle by 34-40% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although the reduction in the arterial pressure in these organs was the same, the responses of the blood flows to the changes in the arterial pressure were different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This suggests that autoregulatory capability varies from organ to organ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is important to study the pathogenesis of carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> giving special consideration to these differences among the autoregulatory capabilities of various organs </plain></SENT>
