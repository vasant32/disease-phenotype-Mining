<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Reperfusion for 1 hr following bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> resulted in significant decrease in total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> (GSH) concentration along with small but significant increase in oxidized <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> (GSSG) levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 4 hr of reperfusion, GSH levels recovered, although GSSG levels remained elevated up to 12 hr of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Increase in malondialdehyde levels was also detected in the brain up to 12 hr of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">Glutathione</z:chebi> reductase activity remained significantly low up to 144 hr of reperfusion, while <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> peroxidase activity remained unaffected </plain></SENT>
