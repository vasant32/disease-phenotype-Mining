<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Patients with severe stenosis of an internal carotid artery with contralateral occlusion (ICO) are at an increased risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and therefore surgical treatment is usually recommended </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) under regional anesthesia enables constant monitoring of neurologic status and selective shunting in cases of clinically evident <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we assess the selective use of shunts based solely on changes in neurological status in awake patients with ICO undergoing CEA as well as their complication rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: During 1996-1998, we studied intraoperative findings and results of CEA under regional anesthesia with clinical monitoring of neurological status in two groups: (1) patients with stenosis (&gt; 70% by NASCET) and contralateral occlusion (n = 50) and (2) patients with stenosis and no contralateral occlusion (n = 94) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Shunt insertion was required in 42% of group 1, and 6% in group 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the patients in group 1 requiring shunts had stump pressures &lt; 50 torr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The average stump pressure of group 1(40 torr) was significantly lower than that of group 2 (75 torr), and was also lower than that of patients with severe contralateral stenosis (35 patients, 76 torr) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rates were identical in both groups (2.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Since ICO patients are at a high risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> during ICA clamping, they require shunt insertion frequently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with no contralateral occlusion require shunting at a much lower rate - even in the presence of severe contralateral stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Regional anesthesia allows for early detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> and therefore, the perioperative results in both groups are similar </plain></SENT>
