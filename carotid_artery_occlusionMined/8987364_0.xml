<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>Hyperglycemia</z:hpo> (20-35 mu mol/ml plasma) was achieved with the infusion of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (i.v.) prior to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forebrain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (10 minutes) was induced by bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Normoglycemic rats were fasted prior to ishcemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ischemic changes of neurons were quantified by a five-point scale in the caudoputamen (CPu), globus pallidus (GP), hippocampus CA 1 (CA 1), parietal cortex (Par), and substantia nigra reticulata (SNR) during ishcemia and for 90 minutes after recirculation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the hyperglycemic group, (1), CPu, CA 1 and Par; severely damaged neurons were seen at 60-90 minutes after recirculation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>(2) GP; there was little neuronal damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>(3) SNR; immediately after recirculation damaged neurons were observed, and more damage was observed at 90 minutes post recirculation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the normoglycemic group, no prominent neuronal damage was observed in any region </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The evolution of neuronal damage was similar in the CPu and Par regions, but was different in the GP and SNR regions </plain></SENT>
