<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:chebi fb="5" ids="17967">urethane</z:chebi>-anesthetized rats, a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure and heart rate was induced by unilateral injections of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi> (30-300 ng) into the caudal ventrolateral medulla </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi> uptake inhibitors nipecotic acid (1-3 micrograms) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48950">L-2,4-diaminobutyric acid</z:chebi> (1 microgram), and the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi>-T inhibitor gamma-acetylenic <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16865">GABA</z:chebi> (1-3 micrograms) injected unilaterally into the brainstem area also produced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001649'>tachycardia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The data provide further evidence that endogenous GABAergic mechanisms in the rat caudal ventrolateral medulla are involved in the regulation of blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It seems unlikely that the GABAergic mechanisms originate mainly from neurons in the nucleus tractus solitarii </plain></SENT>
