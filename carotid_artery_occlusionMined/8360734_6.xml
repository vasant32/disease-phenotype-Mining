<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine whether preoperative angiographic patterns of collateral cerebral blood flow correlate with protection against intraoperative electroencephalographic (EEG) evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> caused by carotid artery cross-clamping during carotid endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have shown that contralateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and intracranial stenoses are associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> during carotid endarterectomy; however, the angiographic collateral flow patterns associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> have not been identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This paper reports a retrospective study of 67 patients who underwent two- to four-vessel cerebral angiography followed by carotid endarterectomy with 16-channel EEG monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The angiograms were reviewed for extracranial occlusive disease and collateral flow patterns, and the EEG recordings were analyzed for ischemic changes during carotid artery cross-clamping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis was by Fisher's exact test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cross-filling of the anterior and middle cerebral arteries from the contralateral carotid artery through the anterior communicating artery correlated with a decreased incidence of EEG ischemic changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only 21% of patients with this collateral flow pattern showed ischemic changes compared to 50% of patients without this pattern (p &lt; 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three angiographic findings occurring in combination on the side contralateral to surgery correlated with EEG <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>: 1) occlusion of the contralateral internal carotid artery (five of seven or 71%, p &lt; 0.03); 2) collateral flow from the external carotid circulation to the internal carotid circulation via the ophthalmic artery; and 3) collateral flow from the posterior circulation to the contralateral anterior circulation via the posterior communicating artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The data presented here corroborate the correlation between contralateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> during carotid endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>They also demonstrate that cross-filling of the anterior and middle cerebral arteries by the contralateral carotid artery protects against such <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This collateral flow may serve as an indicator of tolerance to carotid artery cross-clamping </plain></SENT>
