<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The present study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="38484">ergoline</z:chebi> 5HT2 receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, LY53857 in a rabbit model of vascular <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>LY53857 (1 and 10 microM) inhibited <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> amplified platelet aggregation responses to threshold concentrations of <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi> in rabbit platelets in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>LY53857 (1 microM) not only inhibited the <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> component of rabbit platelet aggregation, but also inhibited in vitro aggregation induced by <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi> (48.7 +/- 16.7% inhibition), collagen (76.1 +/- 15.9% inhibition) and U46619 (65.2 +/- 12.3% inhibition) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effectiveness of this <z:chebi fb="2" ids="38484">ergoline</z:chebi> 5HT2 receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> in blocking aggregation to <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>, collagen and U46619 may be related to its ability to inhibit a <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> component of platelet aggregation since rabbit platelets possess high concentrations of <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> that may be released during aggregation produced by other agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Based on the effectiveness of LY53857 to inhibit rabbit platelet aggregation, we explored the ability of LY53857 to extend the time to carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in rabbits following electrical stimulation of the artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Reproducible carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was induced in rabbits by moderate stenosis coupled to arterial cross clamping, followed by electrical stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With this procedure, occlusion occurred at 47.0 +/- 7 min (n = 30) after initiation of the electrical stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Animals pretreated with LY53857 (50 to 500 micrograms/kg i.v.) showed a delay in the time to carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (at 100 micrograms/kg i.v. occlusion time extended to 164 +/- 16 min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, ex vivo platelet aggregation from animals treated with LY53857 (300 micrograms/kg i.v.) resulted in 40.5% inhibition of platelet aggregation in response to the combination of <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi> (1 microM) and <z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> (1 microM).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
