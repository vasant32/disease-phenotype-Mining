<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have determined whether lowering brain temperature during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> recirculation period following transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> would influence the extent of ischemic neuronal injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Anesthetized rats underwent 10 min of bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> combined with systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> (50 mmHg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four animal subgroups were investigated, including non-ischemic controls; rats whose postischemic brain temperature was maintained at 36 or 30 degrees C starting 5 min into the recirculation period; and rats in which postischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> was begun 30 min into the recirculation period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, intra-ischemic brain temperature was 36 degrees C and body temperature was held at 36-37 degrees C throughout </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three days following the ischemic insult, the CA1 sector of the hippocampus was severely damaged in normothermic rats (36 degrees C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, when postischemic brain temperature was decreased to 30 degrees C starting 5 min into the recirculation period, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-appearing pyramidal neurons were present throughout the CA1 hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A beneficial effect of postischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> was not demonstrated when brain cooling was initiated 30 min into the recirculation period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that postischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> can markedly protect CA1 pyramidal neurons from injury following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">transient ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The 'therapeutic window' for postischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> was found to be narrow under the present experimental conditions </plain></SENT>
