<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The pyramidal cell damage of the hippocampal CA1 subfield was classified into 4 grades according to the proportion of damaged neurons on the tenth day after the ischemic treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The damage score of the SB-tPS group was statistically less than that of the control group </plain></SENT>
