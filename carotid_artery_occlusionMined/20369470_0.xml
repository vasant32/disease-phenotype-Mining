<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Gerbils (n = 48) were divided randomly into three groups: animal model group, BuYangHuanWu recipe group, and sham control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The animal model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was established using bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> followed by unclamp 45 min after occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The microcirculation was observed with a Laser Doppler </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The density of microvascular was measured using Tannic acid <z:chebi fb="2" ids="30808">ferric chloride</z:chebi> mordant dyeing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> (blood brain barrier) permeability was assessed using evan's blue (EB) dye </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The water content in brain tissues was tested with wet and dry method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The learning and memory function test was performed with a 4-PTT dry path maze </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with the animal model group, BuYangHuanWu recipe increased blood flow in the hippocampal region at 1 and 5 min after occlusion, inhibited hypoperfusion at 15 min after reperfusion, increased blood flow at 30, 60 and 120 min after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, BuYangHuanWu recipe inhibited the increase of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> permeability and water content in brain tissues after reperfusion (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>BuYangHuanWu recipe also improved the scores of learning and memory function of the gerbils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: BuYangHuanWu recipe protects the neurofunction in gerbils with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion through modulating cerebral microcirculation damages </plain></SENT>
