<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a study of the cholinergic dysfunction induced by <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16794">scopolamine</z:chebi>, single COE (25, 50, or 100 mg/kg, p.o.) administration significantly attenuated <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16794">scopolamine</z:chebi>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairments</z:hpo> as determined by the passive avoidance and Y-maze tasks (P&lt;0.05) and also reduced escape-latency on the <z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water maze</z:mp> task (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the 2VO study, COE (50 mg/kg, p.o.) significantly reversed 2VO-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairments</z:hpo> in mice by the passive avoidance and the Y-maze tasks (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, COE (50 mg/kg, p.o.) also reduced escape-latency and prolonged swimming time in the target quadrant during a probe trial of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water maze</z:mp> task (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In an in vitro study, COE was found to inhibit acetylcholinesterase activity in a dose-dependent manner (IC(50) value: 81.6 microg/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, COE also inhibited acetylcholinesterase activity in an ex vivo study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that COE attenuates <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairment</z:hpo> induced by <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16794">scopolamine</z:chebi> or 2VO and that these effects are mediated by enhancing the cholinergic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system via acetylcholinesterase inhibition </plain></SENT>
