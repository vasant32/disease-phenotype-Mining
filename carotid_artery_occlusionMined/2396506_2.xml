<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Using a bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> model in the gerbil, we evaluated the cumulative effect of repeated ischemic insults on various physiological and biochemical parameters in brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The most striking consequence of repeated occlusions is a profound, delayed increase in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> between 6- and 24-hr recirculation, after a series of three 5-min occlusions carried out at 1-hr intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This increment in brain water is accompanied by morphological evidence of compressed capillaries with increased filling of larger vessels, consistent with impaired microcirculation even though total blood flow and total vascular volume return toward control levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effect on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> is most severe when occlusions are repeated during the period of postischemic hypoperfusion, although the mechanisms responsible for this effect remain to be determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Histograms of cerebral cortical oxygen tension show a shift toward progressively lower values during the recirculation interval after each occlusion, suggesting that secondary <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> accompanying hypoperfusion may worsen the impact of successive ischemic intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although levels of PCr and ATP indicate adequate recovery of energy metabolism between occlusions, slight elevations of brain <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> persist, consistent with continued <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Under the conditions employed in these studies, repeated occlusions give rise to progressively more prolonged deficits in brain protein synthesis activity, which may thus provide a useful index of the severity of the accumulated ischemic insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Continued studies using this well-defined model should provide further insight into the pathophysiology of ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
