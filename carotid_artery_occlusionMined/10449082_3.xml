<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE AND IMPORTANCE: We present the case of a patient who experienced bilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740392" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">middle cerebral artery infarctions</z:e> after Hunterian ligation and trapping of a ruptured right cavernous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, despite a high-flow extracranial-intracranial bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This is a rare complication, and it highlights the need for further refinements in our understanding of the hemodynamic insufficiency created by major vessel sacrifice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL PRESENTATION: The patient was a 59-year-old woman who experienced multiple episodes of massive <z:hpo ids='HP_0000421'>epistaxis</z:hpo> before undergoing angiography, which revealed left internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and an irregular right cavernous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient was then transferred to our center for treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient was neurologically intact at presentation, and her <z:hpo ids='HP_0000421'>epistaxis</z:hpo> was controlled by nasal packing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: The patient underwent an extracranial-intracranial bypass from the external carotid artery to the M2 segment of the right middle cerebral artery, followed by trapping of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Despite evidence of graft patency, the patient experienced bilateral middle cerebral artery distribution infarctions after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although extracranial-intracranial bypasses protect the majority of patients who undergo carotid artery ligation from ischemic complications, this case demonstrates that hemodynamic insufficiency can occur even with a high-flow saphenous vein graft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Better ways to quantitate the hemodynamic needs of the brain after major vessel sacrifice may facilitate matching of the revascularization strategy to the specific needs of each patient, thus further reducing the likelihood of ischemic complications </plain></SENT>
