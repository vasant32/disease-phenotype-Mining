<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, regional CBF was correlated with transcranial doppler (TCD) measurements at baseline and during 6% <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> inhalation and after intravenous administration of 1 g of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients with a mean age of 62 years (range 45 to 71 years) were included, and the data compared to age-matched healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CBF was measured by intravenous injection of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi>-133 and SPECT (Tomomatic 564) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>TCD of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) was done by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">EME</z:e> TC-64B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A very low global CBF value of 28 +/- 5 (SD) ml 100 g-1 min-1 was found at baseline as compared to 55 +/- 5 ml 100 g-1 min-1 in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During 6% <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi>-inhalation and after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> administration, CBF increased by 58 +/- 24% and 51 +/- 21%, respectively, indicating substantial collateral supply </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Correlative analysis of CBF in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory and TCD in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> showed statistical significance only for the pooled data, i.e. compiling the data obtained during baseline and the two vasodilatory tests, and then only for the mean and peak TCD velocity (e.g. r = 0.59, p less than 0.002, n = 35, mean velocity, right side) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that TCD measurements do not predict regional CBF in patients with CCA occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The study emphasizes that these two methods yield supplementary information, with TCD measurements providing information of the circle of Willis and CBF studies of the flow distribution </plain></SENT>
