<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To compare the operating characteristics of six noninvasive tests for carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DATA SOURCES: A structured search was done using MEDLINE, reference lists from selected articles, and bibliographies from neurology textbooks that focused on the diagnosis of carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The search yielded 568 articles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>STUDY SELECTION: Articles were selected if the noninvasive test results they presented used carotid angiography as the reference standard for comparison, if carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was considered as a separate category, and if contingency tables could be constructed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DATA EXTRACTION: At least two physicians reviewed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> selected articles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Items abstracted included patient demographics, study design, sites of patient enrollment, whether the interpretation of test outcomes was blinded, and specific results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity, specificity, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, and summary measures of effectiveness for each test were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Carotid duplex ultrasonography, carotid Doppler ultrasonography, and magnetic resonance angiography have sensitivities between 0.82 and 0.86, specificities at 0.98, and test-effectiveness measures at or exceeding 3.0 when predicting 100% occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> of 70% or more, these three tests and supraorbital Doppler ultrasonography <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> have sensitivities of 0.83 to 0.86, specificities of 0.89 to 0.94, test-effectiveness measures approaching 3.0, and composite ROC areas of 0.91 to 0.92 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Limiting analysis to studies that enrolled consecutive patients and those in which interpretation of the noninvasive tests was independent of the angiograms did not substantially change our results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Carotid duplex ultrasonography, carotid Doppler ultrasonography, and magnetic resonance angiography are <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> similarly successful at predicting 100% carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and 70% stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Other factors, such as cost, availability, and local experience may influence the decision to use these tests to screen for carotid artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> that may respond to surgery </plain></SENT>
