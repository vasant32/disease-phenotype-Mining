<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>With common carotid artery compression on the side of ICA occlusion in 53 patients, the mean (+/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) ophthalmic systolic pressure/brachial systolic pressure (OSP/BSP) ratio fell from 0.58 +/- 0.013 to 0.42 +/- 0.020 (p less than 0.001), without any cerebral ischemic symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Compression of the contralateral patent common carotid artery resulted in the ophthalmic systolic pressure/brachial systolic pressure ratio dropping from 0.67 +/- 0.012 to 0.29 +/- 0.017 (p less than 0.001) on the patient side and from 0.58 +/- 0.013 to 0.48 +/- 0.018 (p less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six of 53 patients (49%) developed ischemic symptoms in response to compression of the remaining patent ICA system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, only 8 of 122 patients (6.5%) without ICA occlusion developed any symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0262405" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral dysfunction</z:e> (p less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This study suggests embolic events rather than flow reduction may be of greater importance in the production of new symptoms and that contralateral flow is critical to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cerebral function in half the population with ICA occlusion </plain></SENT>
