<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During occlusion of ipsilateral and/or contralateral vertebral and common carotid arteries, the neuronal activity took on three different patterns with respect to the frequency of neuronal discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The incidence of alteration of neuronal activities reflected vestibular excitability dependent on hemodynamic changes due to occlusion of the ipsilateral vertebral artery rather than due to occlusion of the contralateral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Occlusion of common carotid arteries caused no significant difference between the right and left vessels in the resultant change of the neuronal activity, and differed little, either, from occlusion of vertebral arteries in the incidence of the changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A supplementary experiment, in which the four arteries were only partially occluded, clearly showed that the resultant changes in neuronal activity reflect the role of Willis' circle in the maintenance of blood flow to vestibular nuclei </plain></SENT>
