<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> the restoration of blood flow has to occur within a limited time window that is accomplished by fibrinolytic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Newer generation thrombolytic agents (alteplase, pro-urokinase, reteplase, tenecteplase, desmoteplase) have shorter half-life and are more fibrin-specific </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Only alteplase has Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (1996) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The National Institute of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112108" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Neurological Disorders</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> (NINDS) trial proved that alteplase was effective in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subtypes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo> within the first 3 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the European cooperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> study III trial, intravenous (IV) alteplase therapy was found to be safe and effective (with some restrictions) if applied within the first 3-4.5 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion additional transcranial Doppler insonication may improve the breakdown of the blood clot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>According to the ESO and <z:chebi fb="37" ids="15365">ASA</z:chebi> guidelines, intra-arterial (IA) thrombolysis is an option for recanalization within 6 h of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further trials on the IA therapy are needed, as previous studies have involved relatively small number of patients (compared to IV trials) and the optimal IA dose of alteplase has not been determined (20-30 mg is used most commonly in 2 h) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients undergoing combined (IV + IA) thrombolysis had significantly better outcome than the placebo group or the IV therapy alone in the NINDS trial (Interventional Management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> trials) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>If thrombolysis fails or it is contraindicated, mechanical devices [e.g., mechanical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> removal in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> (MERCI)- approved in 2004] might be used to remove the occluding clot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Stenting can also be an option in case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in the future </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>An intra-aortic balloon was used to increase the collateral blood flow in the Safety and Efficacy of NeuroFlo(™) Technology in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>Ischemic Stroke</z:hpo> trial (results are under evaluation) </plain></SENT>
