<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE AND IMPORTANCE: Cerebral revascularization with extracranial-to-intracranial bypass is often required during the surgical treatment of complex <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This report is the first in which a vertebral artery (VA)-to-middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) bypass in conjunction with endovascular coil embolization is used in the successful treatment of a giant <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 68-year-old man previously diagnosed with a 6-cm internal carotid artery (ICA) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> presented complaining of progressing left <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> and mental status changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>His <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> had been treated previously by common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> 20 years earlier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Arteriography defined the partially thrombosed, right supraclinoid ICA <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> arising at the junction of the posterior communicating artery and the supraclinoid ICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: Because of the patient's worsening symptomatology, endovascular coiling with placement of a superficial temporal artery-to-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> bypass was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patient tolerated this procedure well, and his symptoms resolved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, they recurred several months later, and imaging suggested poor right hemispheric perfusion despite a patent bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A VA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> bypass using a saphenous vein graft was then performed using the distal right VA at the level of cervical vertebra 1 (C1) as the donor vessel with a distal anastomotic site on the right <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Coil embolization of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was repeated, and the feeding posterior communicating artery was sacrificed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The patient is currently asymptomatic more than 1 year after the second bypass and coil embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This report describes a safe and definitive treatment option for a giant intracranial ICA <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> using a posterior-to-anterior circulation (VA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) bypass, followed by endovascular coil embolization in a patient with previous ligation of the common carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>VA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> high-flow saphenous vein bypass followed by coil embolization is a useful technique that is especially valuable in the subset of giant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> patients who have previously been treated by carotid ligation </plain></SENT>
