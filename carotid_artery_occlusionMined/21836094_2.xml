<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We prospectively enrolled 20 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> patients with objective ipsilateral hemisphere <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, in whom carotid artery stenting was attempted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Functional assessments, including the National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale, Barthel Index, and a battery of neuropsychological tests, including the Mini-Mental State Examination, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer Disease</z:hpo> Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subtest, verbal fluency, and Color Trail Making A and B, were administered before and 3 months after intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Successful recanalization was achieved in 12 of 20 patients (60%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no procedural or new cerebral ischemic event, except for 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo>, which occurred during the procedure and had neurologic sequelae; this case was excluded from analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The demographics and baseline cognitive performance were similar between the group with a successful outcome (group 1, n=12) and patients who did not (group 2, n=7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ten of 12 patients in group 1 had improvement in ipsilateral brain perfusion after the procedure, but none in group 2 had improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Significant improvement in the scores on the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer Disease</z:hpo> Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subtest (before, 7.7±8.9 versus after, 5.7±7.1; P=0.024), Mini-Mental State Examination (before, 25.8±3.8 versus after, 27.7±2.7; P=0.015), and Color Trail Making A (before, 123.2±68.6 versus after, 99.3±51.5; P=0.017) were found in group 1 but not in group 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Successful carotid artery stenting improves global cognitive function as well as attention and psychomotor processing speed in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
