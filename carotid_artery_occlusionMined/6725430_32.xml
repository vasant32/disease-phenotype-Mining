<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We measured the relationships between changes in extracellular pH (pHe), <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> (Ke), and calcium (Cae) activities and DC potential (DCe) in progressive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> of rat cerebral cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>pHe and Ke, or Cae and Ke, were measured at the same point simultaneously, using triple-barrelled, double-ion-sensitive microelectrodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Ischaemia</z:e> was produced using bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> in rats under 50% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17045,29796">N2O</z:chebi>-0.4% <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi> anaesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Unilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> did not affect blood flow, but bilateral occlusion reduced flow to approximately 40% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Autoregulation of blood pressure (BP) changes was lost after bilateral occlusion, and so progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> produced a linear decrease in flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>pHe began to decrease at high levels of flow (30-35 ml 100 g-1 min-1) and showed stepwise acidotic shifts with reductions in BP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ke was affected at flows of approximately 15 ml 100 g-1 min-1, during which time it was critically dependent on BP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When Ke reached 6 mM, it increased rapidly to 40 mM and was associated with a negative shift in DCe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When Ke reached approximately 10 mM, Cae decreased rapidly to approximately 0.1 mM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>pHe had reached 6.87 when Ke increased rapidly and showed a transient alkalotic shift of approximately 0.14 units at that time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Possible mechanisms for the sequence of ion changes described are discussed </plain></SENT>
