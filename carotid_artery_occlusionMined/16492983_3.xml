<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that resuscitation from HI with 100% O2 would result in greater Egr-1 expression, ROS, and cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (CD) in the brains of newborn piglets than 21% O2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two control groups breathed 21% O2 for 1 h followed by 21% or 100% O2 for 1 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two HI groups underwent carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and breathed 8-12% O2 for 1 h followed by occlusion release and 21% or 100% O2 for 1 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Brain Egr-1 mRNA and protein were analyzed via quantitative PCR and Western blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CD and ROS were measured by fluorescence microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Egr-1 mRNA expression increased throughout the brain in response to HI with regional <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo>, but protein levels did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Resuscitation with 100% oxygen did not cause any additional Egr-1 mRNA, Egr-1 protein, CD, or ROS production as compared with 21% oxygen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in physiologic recovery after HI with room air compared with 100% O2 resuscitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, 100% O2 administration was associated with increased CD in the brainstem independent of HI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Therefore, 100% O2 may have been toxic to some brainstem cells and potentially have significance in long-term neurologic sequelae seen after neonatal HI/resuscitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Egr-1 protein levels may be tightly regulated in an attempt to diminish neurotoxicity or to enhance plasticity at this stage of development </plain></SENT>
