<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An ongoing clinical trial is examining the role of extracranial to intracranial bypass surgery in select patients with impaired cerebrovascular reserve based on PET imaging parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We describe a case utilizing stenting and angioplasty to treat a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> total carotid occlusion as a potential alternative therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 55-year-old woman presented with a right hemispheric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in the setting due to a right internal carotid artery total occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: She was treated medically with antiplatelet therapy and oral vasopressor agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>She returned with new symptoms 1 month later and was successfully treated with stenting and angioplasty </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At the 9-month follow-up, she remains neurologically intact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Stenting and angioplasty may be a therapeutic option in select patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> total carotid occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further study is required to determine the safety profile of this treatment modality </plain></SENT>
