<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This procedure, which allows rapid, noninvasive imaging, showed a partial ophthalmic artery obstruction with absent flow in the central <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> artery, central <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vein, and nasal posterior ciliary arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although altered perfusion of the <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vessels may be evaluated clinically, assessment of blood flow in the ophthalmic and ciliary arteries previously could be evaluated only indirectly by intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi> angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The color Doppler imaging findings were confirmed by intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi> angiography and carotid arteriography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Color Doppler imaging represents a noninvasive method to diagnose abnormal blood flow of the ophthalmic artery and its branches and to evaluate serial changes of the circulation in a noninvasive manner </plain></SENT>
