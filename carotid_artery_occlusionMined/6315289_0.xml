<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The CBF measurements (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">Xenon</z:chebi>-133, inhalation technique) and quantified EEG (qEEG) recordings of 20 patients with cerebrovascular disturbances due to an unilateral internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One of the advantages of the inhalation method is the possibility of the simultaneous CBF measurement of both hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Special attention is paid to the difference in flow between the two hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results of this investigation are compared with the findings of the qEEG studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore the relationship between these results and the clinical state of the patient was studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although computer analysis revealed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002353'>EEG abnormalities</z:hpo> in 80% of the cases no correlation could be found between the grade of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002353'>EEG abnormalities</z:hpo> and the clinical data of the patient and/or the CBF parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A correlation was found between the asymmetry as well as the absolute values of the hemispheric flow and the clinical state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The question whether CBF measurements can provide a better insight into the pathophysiology of the blood flow pattern in patients with unilateral internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusions</z:mp> was considered as well </plain></SENT>
