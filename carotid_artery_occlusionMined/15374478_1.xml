<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Idebenone suspended in 5% gum arabic was applied in 50 mg/kg/day dose to old mice for 1 month through a gastric tube </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>(2) Adult female CFY rats (14-18 months) in which experimental partial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was induced by bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Idebenone was administered intraperitoneally in two dose (10mg/kg and 100 mg/kg body weight) 30 min before the interruption of carotid blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DNA content remained invariate during aging in the brain; idebenone treatment did not exert any influence on this parameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> content as well as total and poly(A)(+) <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> synthesis rates, which were measured by incorporation of tritiated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16704">uridine</z:chebi> into <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>, decreased significantly with age in brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Idebenone treatment did not cause any essential change of the metabolism of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> under the given conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> and DNA contents of brain were influenced neither by experimental partial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> nor by treatment with idebenone during the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Partial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> decreased the rate of total and poly(A)(+) <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> synthesis in the brain about 15-45% depending on the methods and basis of expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This decline could totally be prevented by intraperitoneal application of 10 mg/kg idebenone 30 min before the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the partial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The dose of 100 mg/kg idebenone also elevated the rate of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> synthesis; however, this increase remained statistically insignificant </plain></SENT>
