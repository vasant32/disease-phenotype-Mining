<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Hemodynamic parameters such as regional cerebral blood volume (rCBV), mean transit time (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi>), and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) can be assessed by dynamic susceptibility contrast MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to apply this method in patients who had symptomatic unilateral internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Relative hemodynamic parameters (rCBV, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi>, and rCBF) were evaluated on the occluded side and thus compared with contralateral hemispheric values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also attempted to detect any relationship between collateral flow and the hemodynamic parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Although rCBV was clearly increased in five patients over the whole hemisphere, we did not observe a statistically significant difference regarding the whole sample between sides (mean rCBV, 14.1 +/- 4.58 on the occluded side versus 11.8 +/- 2.99 on the contralateral side, P&gt;.10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> was clearly increased on the occluded side (mean <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi>, 4.29 +/- 0.83 on the lesion side versus 3.14 +/- 0.81 on the contralateral side, P&lt;.010) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A statistically significant decrease of rCBF on the occluded side was observed (mean rCBF, 3.27 +/- 0.73 versus 3.93 +/- 1.03 on the contralateral side; P&lt;.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A significant hemodynamic compromise in patients who had unilateral symptomatic carotid occlusion was observed according to CBF and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This approach might be promising in the understanding of cerebral hemodynamics in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
