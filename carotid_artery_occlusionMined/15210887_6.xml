<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the course of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> and changes in QoL in these patients and whether impaired cerebral metabolism predicts the course of cognitive functioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 73 consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> or a minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> associated with an occlusion of the internal carotid artery (ICA), cognition and health-related QoL in a 1-year follow-up study were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The presence of cerebral ischemic lesions was examined by MRI; the metabolic N-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> ratio and the presence of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> were measured by 1H-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> spectroscopy in the centrum semiovale ipsilateral to the symptomatic ICA occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventy percent of patients with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and 40% of patients with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> were cognitively impaired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In patients with recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> during follow-up, cognitive functioning remained at the same (impaired) level (mean impairment score: at baseline 0.7, at 1-year follow-up 0.6; p = 0.646) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In patients without <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> at baseline and without recurrent symptoms during follow-up, cognitive functioning improved (mean impairment score: at baseline 1.1, at 1-year follow-up 0.7; p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Self-perceived QoL remained affected at 12 months' follow-up, although not to a large extent (mean SD from norm scores &lt;1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with a symptomatic ICA occlusion, cognitive functioning improved within 1.5 years after the ischemic event, if no further symptoms occurred and patients had no <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> at baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Self-perceived QoL remained slightly affected </plain></SENT>
