<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The beneficial effect of intravenous thrombolytic therapy in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> attributable to internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of intravenous recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: ICARO was a case-control multicenter study on prospectively collected data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and ICA occlusion treated with intravenous recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator within 4.5 hours from symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> (cases) were compared to matched patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and ICA occlusion not treated with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cases and controls were matched for age, gender, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The efficacy outcome was disability at 90 days assessed by the modified Rankin Scale, dichotomized as favorable (score of 0-2) or unfavorable (score of 3-6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Safety outcomes were <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and any <z:mp ids='MP_0001915'>intracranial bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Included in the analysis were 253 cases and 253 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Seventy-three cases (28.9%) had a favorable outcome as compared with 52 controls (20.6%; adjusted odds ratio (OR), 1.80; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-3.15; P=0.037) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A total of 104 patients died, 65 cases (25.7%) and 39 controls (15.4%; adjusted OR, 2.28; 95% CI, 1.36-3.22; P=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were more fatal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleedings</z:mp> (2.8% versus 0.4%; OR, 7.17; 95% CI, 0.87-58.71; P=0.068) in the cases than in the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> attributable to ICA occlusion, thrombolytic therapy results in a significant reduction in the proportion of patients dependent in activities of daily living </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Increases in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and any <z:mp ids='MP_0001915'>intracranial bleeding</z:mp> were the trade-offs for this clinical benefit </plain></SENT>
