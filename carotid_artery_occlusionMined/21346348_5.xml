<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with unknown <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> time were prospectively enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We defined patients as having unknown <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> time when the last known <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> time (LNT) was not consistent with the first found abnormal time (FAT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Only patients with anterior-circulation <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and presence of arterial lesion were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intravenous thrombolysis was conducted within 3 h from FAT if the patient showed DWI/FLAIR mismatch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From June 2009 to May 2010, 10 patients [median age, 84 years (interquartile range, IQR, 64-90); National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) score, 14 (IQR, 9-19)] were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subjects included 4 patients who developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> during sleep, 5 with disturbance of consciousness, and 1 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Median interval between LNT and thrombolysis was 5.6 h (IQR, 4.5-9.8) and median interval between FAT and thrombolysis was 2.5 h (IQR, 2.1-2.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three patients had internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, 5 had M1 occlusion, and 2 had M2 occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Early recanalization within 24 h was seen in 7 patients (complete recanalization, n = 4; partial recanalization, n = 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No patients experienced symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> within 48 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At day 7, 5 patients showed dramatic recovery (defined as â‰¥ 10-point reduction in total NIHSS score or score of 0 or 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>At 3 months, favorable outcome (modified Rankin scale score, 0-2) was seen in 4 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients with DWI/FLAIR mismatch may be able to safely receive intravenous thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
