<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between January 1996 and August 2004, 39 patients with large or giant carotid artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were treated with therapeutic carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and had clinical and magnetic resonance imaging follow-up of at least 3 months (mean, 35.9 mo; median, 29 mo; range, 3-107 mo; 117 patient-yr) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Initial clinical presentation was mass effect caused by the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> in 32 (82%) of the 39 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three patients presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> and one presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000421'>epistaxis</z:hpo>; two <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were an incidental finding and one was additional to another ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no early or late complications of therapeutic carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> seemed to have thrombosed completely after carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> as observed on early and late magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiographic follow-up studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At the time of the most recent magnetic resonance imaging follow-up study, 29 (74%) of the 39 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> involuted totally, two <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> decreased to 25% of the original diameter, two <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> decreased to 50%, and five <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> decreased to 75% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> remained unchanged in size after 49 and 58 months, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At the most recent clinical follow-up evaluation, symptoms of mass effect were cured in 19 (60%), improved in 10 (31%), and remained unchanged in three (9%) of the 32 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Therapeutic carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was a simple, safe, and effective treatment for large and giant carotid artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> involute completely or substantially decrease in size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Alleviation of symptoms of mass effect was achieved in most patients </plain></SENT>
