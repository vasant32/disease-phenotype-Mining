<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its role in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive deficits</z:hpo> caused by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to investigate the location and level of peripherin expression in the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system in response to transient global <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, and the resultant effect of peripherin expression on the cholinergic neurons and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">Choline</z:chebi> acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity in this mouse model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transient global <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was induced in C57BL/6 mice by 20-min bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (BCCAO) with microclips </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The resulting impairment of spatial learning and memory was investigated by <z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water maze</z:mp> testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Peripherin expression was evaluated by immunostaining and Western Blot assay of brain sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Peripherin expression increased in neurons of the cortex, hippocampus, and thalamus after BCCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By double immunofluorescence staining, neurons showed a cytoplasmic co-localization of peripherin and MAP-2, but not of peripherin and GFAP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ChAT activity was determined spectrophotometrically using the assay kit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was significantly decreased ChAT activity in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus and thalamus in mice of the BCCAO group (p&lt;0.05), compared with the sham group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After BCCAO, peripherin overexpression was significantly correlated with reduction in ChAT activity (r=-0.929; p&lt;0.01), spatial learning and memory were impaired, and peripherin expression was induced in neurons but not astrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus, peripherin appears to be a participant in learning and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairment</z:hpo> in mice </plain></SENT>
