<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We examined whether following a hypoxic-ischemic insult in young animals there are long-lasting functional deficits that correlate either to histological tissue damage or to potential compensatory plasticity changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Four-week-old rats were subjected to an episode of cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (right carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> + 30 min of <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>) or a sham operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In hypoxic-ischemic animals there were gross neurological deficits 1, 24, and 48 h postinsult with recovery by 1 week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Behavioral deficits were observed in both the acquisition and the performance of a response duration differentiation test and a fine motor control test (staircase test) 3 months after the <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Functional magnetic resonance imaging studies demonstrated less activation in the sensory-motor cortex of hypoxic-ischemic animals in response to left vs right forepaw stimulation 4 months postinsult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Histological assessment delineated striatal, cortical, and hippocampal damage in the hypoxic-ischemic hemisphere and a reduction in cortical thickness, bilaterally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>GFAP immunoreactivity was increased in injured striatum and cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neurofilament heavy chain (NF200) immunoreactivity was normally most intense in white matter and decreased in areas of ipsilateral cortical damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Synaptophysin immunoreactivity was reduced around areas of infarction and somewhat increased in adjacent undamaged striatum and in layer IV of parietal cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The histological damage or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> degenerative changes could account for much of the variance in functional outcome detected with sensitive behavioral tests so that overall the compensatory or plasticity changes evident within the juvenile brain are rather modest </plain></SENT>
