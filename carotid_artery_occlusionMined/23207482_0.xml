<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this cohort study was to assess the efficacy and safety of thrombolysis in patients with eICA occlusion compared to those without eICA occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Methods: Consecutive patients treated with intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator within 4.5 h from symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> included in the Safe Implementation of Thrombolysis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> - International <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Thrombolysis Registry (SITS-ISTR) in 20 Italian centres were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> carotid occlusion was diagnosed using ultrasound examination, angio-CT scan or angio-MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Since the SITS-ISTR database did not plan to report the site of vessel occlusion, each participating center provided the code of the patient with eICA occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into 2 groups, those with and those without eICA occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Main outcome measures were: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, disability (modified Rankin Scale, mRS, 3-6) and any <z:mp ids='MP_0001915'>intracranial bleeding</z:mp> at 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to reveal predictors for main outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The following variables of interest were included in the analysis: presence of eICA occlusion, age, gender, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo>, previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, current smoking, antiplatelet treatment at <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, baseline NIHSS score, baseline blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, cholesterol and blood pressure, history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> to treatment time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Results: A total of 1,761 patients without eICA occlusion and 137 with eICA occlusion were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At 3 months, 42 patients were lost to follow-up (3 with eICA occlusion) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>Death</z:hpo> occurred in 30 (22.4%) patients with eICA occlusion and in 175 (10.2%) patients without (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>Death</z:hpo> or disability at 3 months occurred in 91 of 134 patients with eICA occlusion (67.9%) compared with 654 of 1,722 patients without eICA occlusion (37.9%, p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No or minimal disability at 3 months (mRS 0-1) was reported in 25 (18.7%) patients with eICA occlusion and in 829 (48.2%) patients without (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Any <z:mp ids='MP_0001915'>intracranial bleeding</z:mp> detected by CT or MRI at posttreatment imaging was seen in 16 (11.7%) patients with eICA occlusion and in 314 (17.8%) of those without (p = 0.09) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The proportion of symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> was 5.8% for patients with eICA occlusion and 8.0% for patients without (p = 0.16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>At logistic regression analysis, eICA occlusion was associated with mortality (odds ratio, OR 5.7; 95% confidence interval, CI 2.9-11.1) and mortality or disability (OR 5.0; 95% CI 2.9-8.7) at 90 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: This cohort study in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> treated with thrombolysis showed an association between eICA occlusion and adverse outcome </plain></SENT>
