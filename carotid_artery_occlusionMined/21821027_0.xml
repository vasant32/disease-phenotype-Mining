<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Adult C57BL/6 mice received surgical implantation of bilateral intracranial EEG electrodes in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Animals were subjected to a hypoxic-ischemic (HI) episode consisting of permanent occlusion of the right common carotid artery and subsequent systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> (8% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi> for 30 min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>EEG activities were sorted based on the observance of motor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, poor physical outcome, brain injury, and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>EEG signals were quantified as amplitude, variance, and root mean square, and early alterations in these parameters were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Animals with poor-HI outcome exhibited longer and more profound suppression of EEG signals in the hippocampus ipsilateral to the carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> during HI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the parameters chosen to quantify EEG activity, root mean square demonstrated the greatest sensitivity in predicting subsequent outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, ipsilateral hippocampal EEG signals are a reliable early marker for assessing HI outcome in adult mice, and further characterization of ischemic EEG signals may aid in the development of novel quantitative variables for use in animal models of experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
