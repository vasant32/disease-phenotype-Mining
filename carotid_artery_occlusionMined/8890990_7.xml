<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During the past years surgical revascularization was re-evaluated and considered as an appropriate treatment for a small subgroup of patients with recurrent focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> and impaired haemodynamics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This retrospective study examines the long-term benefit and patency rate of bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We present a follow-up of 5.6 years of 47 patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of whom underwent bypass surgery after 1985 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Forty patients suffered recurring <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tia|TIA|T.I.A.">transient ischaemic attacks</z:e> due to uni- or bilateral internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Examination included neurologic status, TCD with <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690,31163">Diamox</z:chebi> challenge, angiography, CT and SPECT scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neurological improvement was seen in 23% of patients with better results after early surgery, a worsening in 22% suffering further ischaemic events on a postoperative average of 2.8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patency rate for vein graft material was 50%, for the STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> procedure 91% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Occlusion of the vein graft occurred on an average after 1.4 years, other anastomosis after 2.7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that only few patients derived long-term benefit from EC-IC bypasses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Functioning of the bypass worsens over time, suggesting a role for surgery predominantly in the first year of ischaemic events due to insufficient collateral supply </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Actual indications for bypass surgery may be patients with failure of maximal medical therapy and progressive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> and haemodynamic compromise </plain></SENT>
