<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In SHR, a great and progressive increase in cerebral <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> ratio (L/P) ratio) during the first 5-6 hours after occlusion was followed by a gradual decrease as the time interval increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cerebral ATP in SHR decreased as cerebral <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> increased, and an inverse relationship was observed between <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> and ATP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, in NTR, there were minimal changes in cerebral <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> and L/P ratio following carotid occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that bilateral carotid occlusion might cause severe ischemic damages of the brain in SHR, but not in NTR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The hemodynamic factor as a cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in hypertensives is discussed </plain></SENT>
