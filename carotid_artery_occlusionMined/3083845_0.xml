<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Effects of the new chemical agent, bifemelane, on ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> were studied in 70 mongolian gerbils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Five different doses of bifemelane (0.2-25.0 mg/kg) as well as saline were administered intraperitoneally in 6 groups of animals (n = 46), and 30 min afterward both common carotid arteries were occluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The brain was removed 90 min after the occlusion, and the cerebral water content (CWC) in the bifemelane treated groups and the controls was compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To assess hemodynamic effects of bifemelane, regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was also measured in 24 animals using hydrogen clearance techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The CWC in the saline-treated controls (79.9 +/- 0.4%) was significantly increased compared to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values (78.4 +/- 0.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The CWC in the groups receiving 1 mg/kg, 5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg of bifemelane showed 79.3 +/- 0.3%, 79.5 +/- 0.2% and 78.9 +/- 0.3%, which were significantly lower than the controls (p less than 0.005, p less than 0.02, p less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, bifemelane reduced a development of ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The rCBF in the bifemelane groups and the controls measured before the drug administration was the same ranging within 35.0-37.0 ml/100 g brain/min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The administration of bifemelane produced small rCBF increase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After the carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, rCBF in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> control animals decreased below 6.0 ml/100 g brain/min, the critical level for cellular ion-pump function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The majority of bifemelane-treated animals also showed a similar flow reduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, in 33% of animals receiving 10 mg/kg or 25 mg/kg of bifemelane, rCBF was maintained above this critical level.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
