<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Activated forms of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25523">nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide phosphate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi>) oxidase (NOX), which require interaction between cytosolic and membrane-bound subunits, are among the major sources of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> in the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although increasing evidence suggests that NOX has important roles in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegenerative diseases</z:hpo>, its roles in MSN injury after transient global <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> (tGCI) have not been elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To clarify this issue, C57BL/6 mice were subjected to tGCI by bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> for 22 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Western blot analysis revealed upregulation of NOX subunits and recruitment of cytosolic subunits to the cell membrane at early (3 to 6 hours) and late (72 hours) phases after tGCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Taken together with immunofluorescent studies, this activation arose in MSNs and endothelial cells at the early phase, and in reactive microglia at the late phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pharmacological and genetic inhibition of NOX attenuated oxidative injury, microglial activation, and MSN <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> after tGCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that NOX has pivotal roles in MSN injury after tGCI and could be a therapeutic target for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
