<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus, it is important to assess the ICAo character when considering the recanalization method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim was to assess the agreement between the ultrasonographic (US) and perioperative macroscopic (PM) finding in AIS patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ICAo, undergoing an emergent carotid endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: in a retrospective, hospital-based study, the set consisted of 47 patients (36 males; age 49-79, mean 63.7 ± 8.5 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ICAo character was classified as an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> thromboembolus either isolated or in combination with atherosclerotic plaque using the US (B-mode) and the PM evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cohen's Kappa and AC(1) coefficient were applied to assess the methods agreement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ICAo character diagnosed by US was confirmed by the PM evaluation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>US and PM findings were consistent in 41 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The agreement between both methods in the classification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ICAo was 87.2% [95% confidence interval (CI): 77.7-96.8%], κ= .589 (95% CI: .293-.885) (P &lt; .0001), AC(1) = .815 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: US is a reliable method in the diagnostics of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> character of ICAo and it has a good agreement with PM finding regarding a differentiation of atherosclerotic plaque and fresh thromboembolus </plain></SENT>
