<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To develop an experimental model which enables quantitative analysis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0007190'>neuronal loss in the cerebral cortex</z:hpo>, repeated ischemic insult was performed using unilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in Mongolian gerbils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effect of the time interval between the repeated ischemic insult on the survival rate of the animals and the amount of cortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo> were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The time course of the cortical neuronal damage in repeated ischemic insult was also studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We repeated the occlusion four times; i.e., one 10-min and three 7-min occlusions (total 31 min of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The number of animals surviving for 3 weeks after the last ischemic insult was minimum (15.4%) for animals undergoing occlusions at 1-h intervals and maximum (100%) at 24- and 48-h intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The number of ischemic neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> was also dependent upon the time interval, and it was so pronounced as to allow analysis at intervals of 12 hr or 24 hr in the absence of infarction in the cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The number of neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> could not be determined for animals with occlusion at 1-h intervals due to the production of a large infarction, with which the 3-week survival rate was minimum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The temporal profile of cortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo> in the repeated ischemic insult at 24-h intervals indicated that the number of cortical neurons significantly decreased until 7 days after the start of the ischemic procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This model is useful for clarifying the pathophysiology of chronically developing ischemic neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
