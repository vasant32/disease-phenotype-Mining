<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Complete occlusion of the contralateral carotid artery has been thought to increase the risk of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was conducted to determine whether contralateral occlusion (CO) leads to a higher rate of complications among patients undergoing CEA or alters long-term outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> CEAs (N = 221) performed at our institution between September 1997 and June 2002 were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into two groups, i.e., CO and contralateral patency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Statistical analyses were performed using Fisher's exact test for nominal values and the t test for continuous variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Life-table analyses were performed for patency and survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Complete data and follow-up results were available for 170 of the 221 operations performed during the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CO was present in 16 cases (9.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Preoperative demographic features, indications for surgery, and operative techniques did not vary between study groups; there was increased use of general anesthesia (p = 0.05) in the CO group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No surgical <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rates were not statistically different between groups (CO group, 6.3%; contralateral patency group, 2.6%; p = 0.39) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Long-term patency and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-free survival rates at 5 years exceeded 90% and did not vary significantly between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patients undergoing CEA with occlusion of the contralateral carotid artery do not have unique preoperative demographic features or indications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Contralateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> does not increase risk or alter long-term outcomes after CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Carotid revascularization can be safely performed in tertiary military centers </plain></SENT>
