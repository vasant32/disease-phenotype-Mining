<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty-nine neurons whose discharges were interrupted during occlusion of the common carotid arteries were found in the vicinity of the intermediomedial nucleus (IMM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The spontaneous discharges of 10 of these units were correlated in time with the R wave of the ECG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The pattern of R-wave locking of spinal unitary discharge was similar to that for some neurons in the nucleus of the tractus solitarius (NTS; primary site of baroreceptor fiber termination) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, spinal units, whose discharges were interrupted during carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, were activated by stimulation of depressor sites in NTS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest that bulbospinal fibers of the baroreceptor reflex arc terminate on and excite interneurons in the vicinity of IMM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is postulated that these neurons directly inhibit components of sympathoexcitatory pathways located in the intermediolateral spinal nucleus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the inhibitory interneurons receive auxiliary input from sympathetic afferents in the inferior cardiac nerve </plain></SENT>
