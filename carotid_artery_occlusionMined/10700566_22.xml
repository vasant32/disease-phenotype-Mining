<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the study was to evaluate the effect of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the major psychoactive constituent of marijuana, on ischemic neuronal injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 12-min ischemic insult was induced by a reduction in systolic blood pressure to a mean of 50 mm Hg, followed by bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> at a middle ear temperature of 37.5 degrees C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>THC at either a low (0.1 mg/kg; n=8) or high (10 mg/kg; n=8) dose was injected i.p. every 12 h for 7 days prior to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Non-treated ischemic (n=8) animals formed the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The animals were sacrificed 3 weeks post-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> for quantitative histopathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>THC at either dose did not significantly reduce ischemic neuronal damage in the hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The high dose THC-treated group showed significantly less neocortical injury, compared to either the control or low-dose THC groups (p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The striatum was markedly protected by both low and high dose THC (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This regionally specific protection implies that either the hippocampus undergoes suprathreshold ischemic injury or that mechanisms of ischemic injury vary in different brain regions </plain></SENT>
