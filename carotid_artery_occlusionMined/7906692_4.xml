<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An index of exposure of each region to <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> was calculated by integrating <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> concentrations after occlusion </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The difference in vulnerability between striatum and cortex may arise from the additional time needed for the cortex to be exposed to cumulative threshold levels of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
