<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We performed duplex and transcranial Doppler studies in 36 patients with angiographically documented internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (ICAO) to determine the effect of ophthalmic artery collateral (OAC) on measures of vascular resistivity both proximal and distal to the occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Resistance in the common carotid artery, measured by the resistivity index, was significantly lower in the group with OAC than in those without OAC, indicating a shunt to the low resistance intracranial circuit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The pulsatility index (PI) of the Doppler signal in the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery, a measure of both inflow pressure and distal vascular resistance, did not differ between those with and without OAC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the presence of circle of Willis collateral pathways (anterior communicating and/or posterior communicating artery) did appear to have a significant effect on pulsatility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When both were present angiographically, PI was higher than in the group with only 1 Willisian collateral </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that OAC has a marginal effect on vascular resistance in arterial bed distal to an ICAO, while Willisian collaterals appear to have a more important role in cerebral perfusion, as measured indirectly by Doppler methods </plain></SENT>
