<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A simple and rapid histologically based scoring system was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> time of 5 min with stabile core body temperature at 37.5-38.0 degrees C and a post-operative survival time of 4 days was sufficient to induce a reproducible and almost total neuronal damage in the hippocampal subfields </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the use of gerbils with ages varying from 50 to 100 days did not markedly influence the development of the neuronal damage although the variation in the severity of the damage seemed to decrease with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The addition of a drop of room tempered (21-22 degrees C) isotonic water, to avoid adherence between the clips and the carotid artery, reduced neuronal damage in some animals </plain></SENT>
