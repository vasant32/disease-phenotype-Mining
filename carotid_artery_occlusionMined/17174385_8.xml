<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Oroxylin A is a <z:chebi fb="5" ids="47916">flavonoid</z:chebi> compound that is found in the root of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the effects of oroxylin A on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairment</z:hpo> induced by transient bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (2VO) in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The ameliorating effect of oroxylin A on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairment</z:hpo> was investigated using a passive avoidance task, the Y-maze task, and the <z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water maze</z:mp> task in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Oroxylin A was found to significantly reverse 2VO-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairments</z:hpo> in the passive avoidance and Y-maze tasks in a dose dependant manner (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, oroxylin A (5 mg/kg, p.o.) shortened the escape-latency and prolonged swimming times in the target quadrant during the probe trial in the <z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water maze</z:mp> task (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Histochemical and immunohistochemical studies showed that the number of Nissl bodies and OX-42 positive cells in the hippocampal CA1 and dentate gyrus regions were attenuated by oroxylin A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, phosphorylated cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) positive cell numbers were markedly increased in animals treated with oroxylin A than in untreated 2VO controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that oroxylin A dramatically attenuates the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairment</z:hpo> induced by 2VO, and that this effect may be mediated by the neuroprotective effects of oroxylin A as supported oroxylin A induced reductions in activated microglia and increases in BDNF expression and CREB phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
