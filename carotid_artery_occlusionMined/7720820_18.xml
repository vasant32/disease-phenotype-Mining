<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We presently characterize the response further by examining the effect of varying the age, the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoid</z:chebi>, and the time of injection and by examining whether fasting can influence the response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rats (n = 193) were randomized to one of 16 different treatment groups and subjected to <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (right carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> +8% O2 which was 3 h in duration for 7-day, 1 h for 2-week, and 30 min for 1-month-old animals) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The brains were subsequently perfusion fixed and the area of infarction was measured from <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi>- and eosin-stained sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Time dependence studies demonstrated that treatment with 0.1 mg/kg intraperitoneal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> 4 h prior to <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size compared to vehicle-treated animals whereas pretreatment at either 48 h or 4 days was ineffective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">Dexamethasone</z:chebi> pretreatment (4 h) also provided neuroprotection against 4 h of <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fasted animals which received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> had reduced blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels yet markedly less damage than controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Another <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoid</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi> (0.7 mg/kg), also reduced infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 2-week-old animals the area of infarction was reduced by pretreatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi>, whereas in 1-month-old animals <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> was ineffective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoid</z:chebi>-mediated response intervenes in events leading to neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in young animals but not older animals once myelination and synaptogenesis are complete </plain></SENT>
