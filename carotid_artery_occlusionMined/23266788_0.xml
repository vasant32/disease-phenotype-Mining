<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to investigate the age-related changes in spatial performances in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> mild <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1695782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral hypoperfusion</z:e> induced by permanent right common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (rCCAO) in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four-month-old male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 20) were randomly assigned into sham and rCCAO groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Spatial performances of young adult rats (age 4-8 months) were evaluated repeatedly by the radial arm water maze at 6 days, and 1, 2 and 4 months after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The spatial performance was re-assessed by the <z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water maze</z:mp> when the rats were 18 months old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The present results revealed that the rCCAO rats developed progressive deficit in spatial learning and memory, starting from day 6 and significant deficit was found at 2 months after rCCAO (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the spatial performance of the rCCAO rats was recovered at 4 months after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Testing of the cognitive flexibility of the aged rCCAO rats (18 months old), indicated that the learning flexibility of the aged rCCAO rats was significantly impaired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This deficit was found in parallel with pronounced white matter damage in the corpus callosum and internal capsule and significant cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in the dorsal hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results suggested that vascular risk insult in young adult rats resulted in spatial learning deficit which could be completely compensated later on </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, such previous vascular risk could be exacerbated by advancing age and subsequently lead to a deficit in cognitive flexibility with white matter damage and significant neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in the dorsal hippocampus </plain></SENT>
