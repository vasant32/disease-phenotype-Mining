<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These two points explain the difficulties encountered in the development of anti-ischaemic treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They show the necessity of developing simple techniques which would allow real-time monitoring of cerebral haemodynamics and the development of lesions following CIA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PET also allowed the direct evaluation of the haemodynamic repercussions of carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, which are much more severe than suggested by classical data and it is therefore possible that the real frequency of CIA of "haemodynamic" origin is severely underestimated </plain></SENT>
