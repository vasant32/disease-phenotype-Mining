<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nine patients (five men and four women) with a mean age of 62 (range 41 to 82 years) were diagnosed as having symptomatic severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had ipsilateral hemispheric symptoms, seven had <z:hpo ids='HP_0100576'>amaurosis fugax</z:hpo>, and two had associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
