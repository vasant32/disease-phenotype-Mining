<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean CBF was 46 ml/100/g/min on the affected hemisphere and 56 ml/100/g/min on the unaffected hemisphere </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Preoperatively, the mean CBF was 48 ml/100 g/min on the affected side and 57 ml/100 g/min on the unaffected side; the postoperative CBF was 48 ml/100 g/min on the affected side and 56 ml/100 g/min on the unaffected side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus, there was no notable change in CBF on either side after surgery.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
