<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it has not yet been established why traumatic injury of the cortex induces neuronal damage in more remote areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Spreading <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> (SD) may be one potential mechanism for this pathophysiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The present study evaluated whether SD on the cortex evokes a pathological change in the hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Forty-two Fisher rats were assigned to four groups: Group I: sham operation (n = 7), Group II: right carotid occlusion (UO) for 7 days (n = 7), Group III: repeated induction of SD by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32588">KCl</z:chebi> application on dura for 7 days (n = 7), Group III' for 3 h (n = 7), Group IV: SD induction and UO for 7 days (n = 14) Group IV' for 3 h (n = 7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 5 out of 7 animals in Groups III' and IV', cerebral blood flow (CBF) was monitored using laser Doppler flowmetry for 3 h during the passage of SD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The brains were processed for immunohistochemical analysis of microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Reactive hyperemia induced by SD was not significantly suppressed by right carotid occlusion (194 +/- 25% and 181 +/- 42% UO in Groups III and IV, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 6 out of 7 animals in a 7-day model of Group IV, and 3 animals in a 7-day model of Group III, MAP2 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> in the CA3 area of the hippocampus (partly including CA2) was observed, although no change in the hippocampus was observed in other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, SD in combination with UO yielded reproducible lesions in CA3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Neuronal injury in the hippocampus after brain trauma may be attributable to SD in combination with the blood flow restriction </plain></SENT>
