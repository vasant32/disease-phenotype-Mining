<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On the day before exposure, under a brief anesthesia, a Levine preparation (unilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>) was performed on group 1 (n = 8) and 2 (n = 28), but not on group 3 rats (n = 8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Group 1 rats were exposed to air as control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Groups 2 and 3 rats were exposed to 0.27% CO in air for 60 min [carboxyhemoglobin (HbCO) = 70%] followed by a 2-day recovery in air </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Levine preparation per se did not induce any detectable physiologic effects on group 1 rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Identical cardiovascular and metabolic responses to CO occurred in groups 2 and 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After the CO exposure, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> group 3 rats lived for 2 days with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> neurologic index (NI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In group 2 (n = 25 post-CO), 84% of the rats showed increased NI and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> of the ipsilateral cerebral hemisphere, and 76% of the rats died 8.7 +/- 1.7 h after the CO exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>NI correlated with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> (rs = 0.748, P &lt; 0.001) and inversely correlated with the survival time after the CO exposure (rs = -0.777, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We therefore may conclude that exposure of the Levine-prepared rats to 0.27% CO in air for 60 min will provide a valuable model for testing of different treatments for CO poisoning </plain></SENT>
