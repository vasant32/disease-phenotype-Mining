<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One hour after carotid occlusion in hypertensive rats, supratentorial <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> increased to 383% and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> ratio to 280% of the controls, while <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15422">adenosine triphosphate</z:chebi> (ATP) decreased to 69% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These metabolic changes were thought to be due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Arterial pCO2 was lowered and the pH was raised in the hypertensive animals due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>hyperventilation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the normotensive rats, carotid occlusion had minimal effects on cerebral metabolism and arterial acid-base balance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that hypertensive rats are more susceptible to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> caused by carotid occlusion than normotensive rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Increased cerebrovascular resistance in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> is discussed as a causal factor in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
