<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>Cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was induced, using the bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> method, for 60 min followed by reperfusion up to 120 min in gerbils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nicardipine (1 mg/kg) or saline (vehicle-treated) was given to gerbils 30 min prior to the occlusion of the common carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PDH activity and metabolites (ATP, PCr, and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi>) were measured in cortex prior to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, immediately following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, and after each reperfusion period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 60 min <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, PDH activity increased in both groups, and was significantly higher in the nicardipine-treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After 20 min reperfusion, PDH activity in the nicardipine-treated group recovered to control levels, whereas, the PDH activity in the vehicle-treated group remained elevated, and was higher than the nicardipine-treated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At 60 and 120 min reperfusion, the activities in the vehicle-treated group were significantly below control levels, there were no differences, however, between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>ATP and PCr concentrations were markedly depleted immediately after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ATP levels at 20 min reperfusion and PCr levels at 60 min reperfusion were significantly higher in the nicardipine-treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">Lactate</z:chebi> concentrations in both groups increased 7-8 fold, similarly, immediately after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>During reperfusion, the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> remained elevated in both groups, though the levels in the nicardipine-treated group were lower than those in the vehicle-treated group, but not significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Nicardipine treatment normalized PDH activity quickly and improved energy metabolism after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
