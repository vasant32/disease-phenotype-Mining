<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This technique of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">vascular occlusion</z:e> is very useful in facilitating the dissection of difficult <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> as well as in reducing the risk of intraoperative rupture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) cases in Hunt &amp; Hess's grade III, undergoing early surgery, who had shown a transient neurological deficit at the time of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> or where vasospasm was evident in intraoperatively were prominent among 6 cases where the median nerve SEP was lost within 13 minutes of temporary <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion at 28.6 degrees C to 31.1 degrees C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A transient neurological deficit was seen in one of these and a permanently increased deficit in the other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the SEP was well maintained during occlusion times of upto 52 minutes in 8 cases in the absence of any of the above circumstances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The SEP was lost after 7 minutes in one of 5 cases of internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>; this was followed by a <z:mp ids='MP_0000754'>paresis</z:mp> of a few hours' duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The posterior tibial nerve SEP was absent for one minute in one of 5 cases of bilateral A1 segment occlusion; none of these cases showed a postoperative deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that 1. appropriate SEP monitoring can make a major contribution to patient safety in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> surgery, 2. substantially longer <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596298" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebrovascular occlusion</z:e> times are permissible during <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> than at <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> temperatures and 3. the employment of additional cerebral protective measures should be considered in cases at high risk from ischaemic damage </plain></SENT>
