<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Attention disturbance, left unilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0871399" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">spatial neglect</z:e>, and constructional disturbance were also observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRI revealed high intensity lesions over the right parietotemporal cortex and white matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance angiography showed occlusion of the right internal carotid artery, and ultrasonography revealed left moderate internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Utilization and imitation behavior is usually attributed to a frontal lesion, rarely to a basal ganglionic or thalamic lesion, but not to a parietotemporal lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this patient, the utilization and imitation behavior was thought to be attributed to right frontal lobe dysfunction without apparent MRI abnormalities, supposedly because of the right internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in addition to the right parietal lobe infarction, both of which are thought to suppress the executive center in the left parietal lobe </plain></SENT>
