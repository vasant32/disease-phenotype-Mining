<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is established that subchronic intraperitoneal injections of GK-2 (0.5 mg/kg) 4 h after surgery, followed by seven more injections made every 24 h, fully prevent the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of operated animals and reduces the development of habitation deficit (open-field test) and decrease in exploratory activity (novel object examination) two weeks after surgery, as well as fully restores the viability of cerebral cortex cells and decreases the hyperexpression of HSP70 in cerebral cortex </plain></SENT>
