<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Neonatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> is associated with high mortality and life-long developmental consequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therapeutic options are very limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We assessed the effects of D-JNKi, a small <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) MAP kinase inhibitor, on neuroinflammation, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> integrity and neuronal damage in a neonatal rat model of ischemic brain damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hypoxic-ischemic (HI) brain injury was induced in postnatal-day 7 rats by unilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>, and was followed by intraperitoneal D-JNKi treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate here for the first time that a single intraperitoneal injection with D-JNKi directly after HI strongly reduces neonatal brain damage by &gt;85% with a therapeutic window of at least 6 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>D-JNKi treatment also restored cognitive and motor function as analyzed at 9 weeks post-insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neuroprotective D-JNKi treatment inhibited phosphorylation of nuclear c-Jun (P-c-Jun), and consequently reduced activity of the AP-1 transcription factor and production of cerebral cytokines/chemokines as determined at 3 and 24 h post-HI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of P-c-Jun by D-JNKi is thought to be mediated via inhibition of the upstream phosphorylation of cytosolic and nuclear JNK and/or by preventing the direct interaction of phosphorylated (P-)JNK with c-Jun </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, however, HI did not induce a detectable increase in P-JNK in cytosol or nucleus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Notably, we show here for the first time that HI induces P-JNK only in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> fraction, which was completely prevented by D-JNKi treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The hypothesis that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> JNK activation is key to HI brain injury was supported by data showing that treatment of rat pups with Sab(KIM1) <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi>, a specific <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> JNK inhibitor, is also neuroprotective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of HI-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> JNK activation was associated with preservation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> integrity as evidenced by prevention of ATP loss and inhibition of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The HI-induced increase in apoptotic markers (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> release and caspase 3 activation) as analyzed at 24 h post-HI were also strongly reduced by D-JNKi and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL were upregulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Neuroprotection was lost after repeated 0+3h D-JNKi treatment which was associated with complete inhibition of the second peak of AP-1 activity and disability to upregulate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>We show here for the first time that D-JNKi treatment efficiently protects the neonatal brain against ischemic brain damage and subsequent cognitive and motor impairment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>We propose that inhibition of phosphorylation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> JNK is a pivotal step in preventing early loss of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> integrity leading to reduced neuroinflammation and inhibition of apoptotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Moreover we show the crucial role of upregulation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> anti-apoptotic proteins to maintain neuroprotection </plain></SENT>
