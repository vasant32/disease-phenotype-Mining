<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether the changes detectable with magnetic resonance imaging techniques during and after an episode of cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> differ in immature and older brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Diffusion weighted (DW) and T2-weighted (T2W) images were repeatedly acquired before, during, and after an episode of cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (unilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> plus <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>) in 2- and 4-wk-old rats lightly anesthetized with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Areas of increased brightness were detected in DW images from both 2- and 4-wk-old rats by 10-20 min after the start of <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These hyperintense areas increased during <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>, comprising 60.8+/-4.9% and 30.5+/-2.7% of the brain image at the level of the thalamus in 2-wk-old and 4-wk-old animals, respectively (p &lt; 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hyperintense areas (e.g. 27.0+/-8.3%) also appeared in T2W images during <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in 2-wk-old animals, but these did not occur in 4-wk-old animals (p &lt; 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This observation was reflected in T2, which increased during <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in the 2-wk-old but not the 4-wk-old group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By 60 min after the termination of <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in either age group, areas of hyperintensity resolved and then reappeared 24 h later on both DW and T2W images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, irrespective of age, magnetic resonance imaging changes during transient <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> generally recover with a delayed or secondary increase in DW and T2W hyperintensity hours later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Immature brain differs from older brain primarily with respect to some combination of hypoxic/ischemic cellular or biochemical changes, that are detectable as increases in T2 within 2-wk-old but not 4-wk-old animals </plain></SENT>
