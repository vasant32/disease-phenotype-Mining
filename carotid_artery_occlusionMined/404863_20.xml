<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Microfil-injected specimens of the rabbit and monkey pituitary-median eminence complex were examined by light microscopy after intracranial internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In each species a common neuropophyseal capillary network was found uniting infundibulum (median eminence), infundibular stem and infundibular process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This capillary bed is supplied from above by superior hypophyseal arteries and from below by inferior hypophyseal arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An artery to the infundibular stem was found in some species </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With occlusion of the intracranial internal carotid arteries, flow through superior hypophyseal arteries did not occur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Yet the entire neurohypophyseal capillary bed filled upon injection with Microfil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest the concept of a restricted arterial supply to the median eminence with drainage to the underlying adenohypophsis on one hand and to the infundibular process with drainage to the systemic circulation on the other must be modifed and that blood flow within the neurohypophyseal capillary bed (between infundibular process and median eminence) occurs </plain></SENT>
