<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Gerbils were pretreated with a sublethal ischemic insult, 2 min of bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, and 24 h later given a 5-min lethal ischemic insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Animals were reperfused for 0, 10, or 60 min, or 1, 3 or 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Brain metabolites, ATP, PCr, and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi>, and PDH activity were measured in the cortex and the hippocampal CA1 region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The pretreatment had no effect on ATP and PCr <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> or on <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> accumulation after the 5-min insult, nor on their recovery up to 1 day reperfusion, although there was a difference in the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> levels of the non-pretreated and the pretreated gerbils after 10 min reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The pretreatment also had no effect on PDH activity during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and reperfusion in either region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, at 3 days reperfusion the non-pretreated animals exhibited a secondary decrease in ATP levels in the hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At 7 days reperfusion, ATP levels in the hippocampus of both the pretreated animals and the non-pretreated animals were significantly decreased compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the level of ATP in the non-pretreated group was significantly lower than that in the pretreated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The pretreatment with a sublethal ischemic insult did not effect the initial recovery of metabolites or the activity of PDH following transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, it protected against the secondary decrease of ATP levels in the hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus, the induction of ischemic tolerance is not caused by a reduction in metabolic impairment during the secondary insult </plain></SENT>
