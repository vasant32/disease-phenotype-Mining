<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> for 15 minutes and reperfusion of the gerbil brain for 15 minutes, we determined the brain tissue concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16978">leukotrienes C4</z:chebi> and D4 by radioimmunoassay; they had increased from a baseline concentration of less than 1 to a mean +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e> concentration of 12.8 +/- 3.9 pmol/g brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also studied the effect of a <z:chebi fb="5" ids="47916">flavonoid</z:chebi> 5-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35856">lipoxygenase inhibitor</z:chebi> on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25029">leukotriene</z:chebi> production in the reperfused gerbil brain </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The enhanced production of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16978">leukotrienes C4</z:chebi> and D4 in the reperfused brain was reduced by approximately 80% (from a mean +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e> of 12.8 +/- 3.9 to 2.2 +/- 1.3 pmol/g brain) in the presence of the 5-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35856">lipoxygenase inhibitor</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="5" ids="47916">flavonoid</z:chebi> did not affect the production of <z:mp ids='MP_0002515'>prostaglandin D2</z:mp>, the concentration of which also increased in the reperfused ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
