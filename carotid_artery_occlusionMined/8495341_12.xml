<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Latency of step-through was shortened for the entire 7-day period when gerbils were trained at day 3 after 3 episodes of carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> for 2 min each at 60-min intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, latency of passive avoidance was shortened for 63 days when gerbils were retrained at 14 days after occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Severe <z:mp ids='MP_0002229'>neuronal degeneration</z:mp> in the CA1 regions of the hippocampus was observed 4 and 17 days after occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A close correlation was seen between latency in the passive avoidance response and neurological degeneration of the hippocampal CA1 region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This fact was strongly supported by the results of another experiment that 1 2-min occlusion with almost no <z:mp ids='MP_0002229'>neuronal degeneration</z:mp> did not affect learning behavior while 3 1-min occlusions showed neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and impairment of learning behavior of a moderate degree 4 days after occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that this gerbil model with carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> is useful for the quantitative measurement of functional changes in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phase of repeated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
