<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The validity of iodoamphetamine (<z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi>) SPECT study in the evaluation of cerebral blood flow (CBF) or neurologic function is still controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, the authors showed several cases in whom SPECT images of brain were not compatible with their neurologic deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 2 typical cases, a large low-density area was observed in the non-dominant hemisphere in computed tomography (CT) scan, but no apparent motor-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0748618" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sensory deficits</z:e> in left limbs were present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In these patients, SPECT study also revealed flow reduction in the affected side of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>So there was a possibility that an <z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi> brain image could not always reflect CBF, which maintains neurologic function of the brain </plain></SENT>
