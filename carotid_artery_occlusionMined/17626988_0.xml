<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The aim of this article is to investigate the association between internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (ICAO) and the presence of atherosclerotic disease and vascular risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The clinical characteristics and risk factors of 120 patients presenting with ICAO were retrospectively reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients (n = 120) had at least 1 of the 4 vascular risk factor (<z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, smoking, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>); 2, 3, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 4 risk factors were present in 14 to 82 of the patients (11.7% to 68.3%), 10 to 39 of the patients (8.3% to 32.5%), and 9 of the patients (7.5%), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 84 patients (70%) with ICAO had disease in at least 1 additional vascular bed (aorta, coronary or lower limb arteries) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition to ICAO, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> was present in 2 and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 of these arterial beds in 42 (35%) and 9 (7.5%) patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, stenosis or occlusion of the ipsilateral or contralateral vertebral arteries was recorded in 19 of 120 patients (15.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Regarding the contralateral carotid artery, 1 patient had bilateral ICAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One patient had contralateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, and 1 patient was excluded from the analysis because of surgery to the contralateral carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the remaining 117 patients, 34 (29.0%) had less than 50% contralateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thirty-two patients (27.4%) had 50% to 69%, and 51 (43.6%) had 70% to 99% stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Ultrasonographic imaging of the carotid plaque of the contralateral carotid artery revealed that 52 of the 120 arteries (43.3%) were uniformly or predominantly echolucent (types I and II, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Fifty-nine (49.2%) were predominantly or uniformly echogenic (types III and IV), and 9 (7.5%) could not be classified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A similar distribution of echomorphology was observed on the occluded side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>ICAO is associated with widespread atherosclerotic disease and a high prevalence of vascular risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Detection of ICAO should prompt the investigation of other arterial beds and treatment of risk factors </plain></SENT>
