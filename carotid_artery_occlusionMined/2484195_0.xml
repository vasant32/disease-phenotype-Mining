<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The first was a 42-year-old male admitted because of left <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> 3 hours after receiving blows to the face </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography (CT) scan obtained 10 hours after injury showed an area of slight low density in the right frontotemporal region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Carotid angiography demonstrated tapered occlusion of the right cervical internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A large <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> had developed in the right hemisphere and the patient died 10 days after the traumatic incident </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The second case involved a 45-year-old male hospitalized with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> and right <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> about 1 month after incurring a depressed fracture of the left temporal bone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CT revealed two small low-density areas in the left <z:chebi fb="47" ids="37409">corona</z:chebi> radiata, and carotid angiography disclosed tapered occlusion of the left cervical internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The neurological signs gradually improved after <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Early diagnosis of traumatic cervical carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> may be difficult in the absence of apparent cervical trauma with focal cerebral symptoms appearing after a lucid interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No definitive management has been established and the prognosis is poor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It is emphasized that unusual neurological symptoms following head or cervical trauma should provoke suspicion of carotid artery injury, which, on diagnosis, should be promptly treated </plain></SENT>
