<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up was 24.9 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Five-year cumulative survival and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-free rates by life-table analysis were 62% and 75%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>Deaths</z:hpo> were due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in 7 of 40 patients (17%) and were of cardiac origin in 22 of 40 patients (55%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> were ipsilateral in 20 of 31 patients (65%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No statistically significant difference between the sexes could be demonstrated for either <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, nor was age correlated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> increased the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, whereas gender and aspirin consumption had no discernible effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Endarterectomy of the opposite carotid artery did not significantly affect the natural history but did reduce the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate in the territory of the operated artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Presenting symptoms were useful for estimating prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two of 111 patients referred for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (20%) suffered a further <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and 21 of 111 patients (19%) died (three were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-related), whereas of those patients referred for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>), only 2 of 42 patients (5%) suffered a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and none died </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The limited value of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> in predicting <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and the high mortality rate unrelated to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in this group are important considerations when therapy is considered for these patients </plain></SENT>
