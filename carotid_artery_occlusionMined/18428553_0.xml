<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, the initial cause of the damage is a blockage in a blood vessel (often the middle cerebral artery) and this sets off several pathways that ultimately lead to cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have demonstrated that several new mechanisms are involved in neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and this has led to an increase in research into novel molecules that might prevent brain damage or improve recuperation post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There are several models of global <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two of the most widely-used models are discussed in detail in UNIT 9.5, the gerbil bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (BCAO) model and rat 4-vessel occlusion (4-VO) model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additionally, several models of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> have been developed to mimic the effects of human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The rationale behind the use of animal models, the various types of models and advantage and disadvantages of each model are presented </plain></SENT>
