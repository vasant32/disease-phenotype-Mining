<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, postnatal day 7 rats underwent middle cerebral artery electrocoagulation and transient homolateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, a lesioning protocol that resulted in ipsilateral (IL) forebrain ischemic injury, leading to a cortical cavity 3 weeks later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The effects of neonatal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> on hemispheric damage, cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, cell proliferation, and neurogenesis were examined 4 hours to 6 weeks later by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi> nick-end labeling assay and immunohistochemistry of Ki-67 in proliferating cells and of doublecortin, a microtubule-associated protein expressed only by immature neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neonatal ischemic injury resulted in persistent reduced IL and transient reduced contralateral (CL) hemispheric areas, a consequence of sustained and transient cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in the IL and CL areas, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ki-67 immunostaining revealed 3 peaks of newly generated cells in the dorsal SVZ and SGZ in the IL side and also in the CL side at 48 hours and 7 and 28 days after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Double immunofluorescence revealed that most of the Ki-67-positive cells were astrocytes at 48 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ischemic injury also stimulated SVZ neurogenesis, based on increased doublecortin immunostaining in both SVZs at 7 to 14 days after injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Doublecortin-positive neurons remained visible around the lesion at 21 days but displayed an immature shape in discrete chains or clusters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although unilateral ischemic damage was produced, results indicate successful regenerative changes in the CL hemisphere, allowing anatomical recovery </plain></SENT>
