<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Controversy exists on how to assess a patient's tolerance before permanent carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine the positive predictive value of synchronous opacification of hemispheric cortical veins at angiography of the contralateral carotid or vertebral artery as a predictor of tolerance to permanent carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> without development of ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventy-six angiographic test occlusions were performed in 74 consecutive patients considered for therapeutic occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Angiography of collateral cerebral vessels was performed during test occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Synchronous filling (a &lt; 0.5-second delay of opacification between the cortical veins of the occluded and collateral vascular territories) was considered a predictor for tolerance to permanent occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To detect clinically silent ischemic defects, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging was performed before and 6-12 weeks after permanent occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Positive predictive value (95% confidence interval [CI]) of synchronous venous filling for absence of ischemic deficits after permanent occlusion was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No procedural complications of the test occlusion occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 51 of 54 patients who passed the test, permanent occlusion was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two patients, both in poor clinical condition after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>, died of diffuse vasospasm after permanent occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of the 49 surviving patients, one developed a transient discrete <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> with small new hypoperfusion infarctions on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> other patients remained neurologically unchanged with no new ischemic lesions on follow-up <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Positive predictive value of tolerance to carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> after passing the angiographic test was 98% (95% CI: 89-100%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The angiographic test occlusion protocol reliably predicts tolerance to therapeutic carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>It is safe and easy to perform </plain></SENT>
