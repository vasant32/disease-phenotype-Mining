<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (BCO) with heart rate held constant by electrical pacing (150 beats/min) resulted in increases in systolic, (33%) diastolic (40%), and mean (35%) arterial pressures, LV systolic pressure (33%) and left ventricular (LV) dP/dt (37%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After blockade of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> synthesis with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi> (N = 11) or meclofenamate (N = 6) the increases in systolic (41%), diastolic (45%), and mean (41%) arterial pressures, LV systolic pressure (39%), LV dP/dt (52%), and cardiac work caused by BCO were significantly greater, in spite of the initially higher baseline values (11-18%) following the administration of the drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the changes in circumflex coronary blood flow and coronary vascular resistance to BCO were essentially the same before and after inhibition of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Systemic <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> synthesis may, therefore, play a significant role in the control of systemic arterial pressure and myocardial function, most probably by modulating the release of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> from adrenergic nerve terminals, without adversely affecting coronary blood flow regulation </plain></SENT>
