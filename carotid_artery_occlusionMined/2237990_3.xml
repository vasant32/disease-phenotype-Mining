<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>U78517F inhibited 200 microM <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30812">FeCl2</z:chebi>-initiated <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation in rat brain homogenates by 50% at a concentration of 0.6 microM compared with 8 microM for U74006F, 28 microM for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22470">alpha-tocopherol</z:chebi>, and 43 microM for the ring portion of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22470">alpha-tocopherol</z:chebi> (i.e., trolox) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>U78517F is devoid of hypothermic or antiexcitotoxic actions or interactions with known neurotransmitter receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When administered intraperitoneally to male gerbils at 10 minutes before and again at the end of a 3-hour period of unilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, U78517F decreased 24-hour postischemic cortical neuronal <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neuronal density in the medial portion of the cortex was increased from 34.2% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in vehicle-treated animals to 86.3% in the U78517F-treated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the lateral cortical area, the vehicle group showed only 3.3% neuronal survival versus 48.2% in the drug-treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a separate series of experiments with the same focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> model, identical dosing with U78517F enhanced the postischemic recovery of cortical extracellular calcium without any effect on ischemic or postischemic cortical blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The effect on calcium recovery was observed at intraperitoneal doses as low as 0.1 mg/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The compound also was effective in partially attenuating 1-week postischemic hippocampal CA1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo> in a gerbil global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> model involving brief (15-minute) bilateral carotid occlusion, but sustained dosing was required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results document the anti-ischemic efficacy of a novel and potent inhibitor of iron-catalyzed <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation and further support a key role of oxygen radicals in postischemic brain damage </plain></SENT>
