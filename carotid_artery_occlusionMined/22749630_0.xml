<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The etiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271560" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lymphocytic hypophysitis</z:e> is still unclear, but an autoimmune pathogenesis has been advocated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In fact, histopathologic specimens reveal a diffuse infiltration of the hypophysis by CD3(+)CD4(+) T cells and CD20(+) plasma cells, and antipituitary antibodies are usually found in sera of affected patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although previous cases were found to be correlated only to pregnancy and the postpartum period, recent reports in men and women (without association with pregnancy) suggest a possibly higher prevalence of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We present the case of a 55-year-old woman affected by an unusually aggressive form of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271560" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lymphocytic hypophysitis</z:e> that infiltrated both cavernous sinuses causing bilateral internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis was achieved with both a biopsy specimen of the pituitary gland and the detection of antipituitary antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The prompt administration of steroid therapy was effective to obtain regression and stabilization of the disease, but both carotid arteries remained permanently occluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The natural history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271560" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lymphocytic hypophysitis</z:e> is unpredictable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It usually has a benign evolution, but in exceptional cases the inflammatory process may extend beyond the pituitary gland and infiltrate the surrounding structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These extremely serious consequences highlight the importance of early diagnosis and treatment of this otherwise curable disease </plain></SENT>
