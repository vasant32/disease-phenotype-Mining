<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 12-day-old rats, HI was induced by right carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> followed by 90 min of 8% O2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immediately upon reoxygenation, the rats were treated with NOS inhibitors (n = 24) or placebo (n = 24) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neuropathology was scored at 6 weeks after HI on a 4-point scale (n = 12 per group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expression of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression for cytokines were measured 12 h after HI (n = 12 per group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Histopathological analysis showed that the ipsilateral hemisphere in the NOS inhibition group was less damaged than in the placebo group (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>HI induced a significant increase in HSP70 levels (p &lt; 0.05) in the ipsilateral hemispheres, which tended to be lower in the NOS inhibition group (p = 0.07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>HI induced an increase in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression for IL-1beta, TNF-alpha and TNF-beta, but there was no difference between the ipsi- and contralateral hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Combined inhibition of nNOS and iNOS did not induce any change in cytokine expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the long-term neuroprotective effects of combined nNOS and iNOS inhibition were not achieved by an altered cytokine response </plain></SENT>
