<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Six patients (0.6%) died, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>; 17 other patients (1.8%) had another <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and 21 patients (2.2%) had temporary neurologic symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Complete x-ray films detailing the opposite internal carotid artery and carotid artery back pressure were available for 783 operations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Correlation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> to back pressure, status of the contralateral internal carotid artery, preoperative neurologic deficit, and carotid clamp time was examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis demonstrated significantly increased neurologic complications only if the systolic carotid back pressure was less than or equal to 50 mm Hg or the contralateral internal carotid artery was occluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Analysis to determine if these factors were dependently related showed that when both a contralateral carotid occlusion and a carotid back pressure of less than or equal to 50 mm Hg coexisted (82 patients), the rate of permanent deficit was 11.0% compared with 2.8% when either factor was singly present and 0.9% when neither factor was present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No statistical difference exists between the group with only a single factor and those with neither factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When a temporary shunt is not used during carotid endarterectomy, the risk of neurologic complication is increased if both a contralateral internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and a carotid back pressure of less than or equal to 50 mm Hg coexist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The use of a shunt in this patient population may be beneficial </plain></SENT>
