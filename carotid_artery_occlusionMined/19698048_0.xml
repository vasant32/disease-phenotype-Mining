<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: Treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysms</z:hpo> by endovascular deployment of liquid embolic agents has been proposed as an alternative strategy to conventional coiling, and new materials are being developed for embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, the authors used a single-injection, biocompatible, biodegradable and pH-responsive acrylated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16261">chitosan</z:chebi> (aCHN) with conjugated vascular endothelial growth factor (rhVEGF) in a rat <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The efficacy of the aCHN formulation with rhVEGF was tested using a common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> model in rats, and the extent of embolization was evaluated using quantitative, qualitative, and histopathological techniques after 14 days of implantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean occlusion was significantly greater for the rhVEGF/aCHN-treated group (96.8 +/- 3.0%) than for the group receiving aCHN (74.7 +/- 5.6%) (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Through qualitative evaluation, intimal and medial proliferation were significantly greater with rhVEGF/aCHN than with aCHN and controls (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Degradation of the aCHN filler was monitored in concert with the production of extracellular matrix components </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Macrophages migrated in and proliferated inside the occluded carotid artery lumens were identified by histological and immunostainings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results showed resorption of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16261">chitosan</z:chebi> with concurrent development of collagen and elastin into the vessel lumen, suggesting clot maturation into <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16261">Chitosan</z:chebi> with a bioactive agent such as rhVEGF showed excellent results in occluding <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> in a rat model </plain></SENT>
