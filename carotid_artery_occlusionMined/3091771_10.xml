<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow (CBF) and the response to <z:mp ids='MP_0002318'>hypercapnia</z:mp> (cerebral reactivity) have been measured in 41 patients with unilateral or bilateral internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in an attempt to identify those with limited collateral reserve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Normocapnic CBF was within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> limits in the majority of subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The response to <z:mp ids='MP_0002318'>hypercapnia</z:mp> varied from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> to absent, with impaired reactivity becoming increasingly likely when more than one artery was diseased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 19 patients with unilateral carotid occlusion, hemisphere reactivity was well preserved in the majority, but was significantly lower on the side of the occlusion (mean 2.9%/mm Hg) compared to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> side (mean 3.4%/mm Hg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Reactivity on the side of the occlusion was further reduced in 15 patients with occlusion and contralateral internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> (mean 1.7%/mm Hg) and was even lower in seven patients with bilateral occlusion (mean 1.1%/mm Hg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in reactivity between asymptomatic hemispheres in the 41 patients (mean 2.7%/mm Hg) and hemispheres in which a previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> had occurred (mean 2.8%/mm Hg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast the response in hemispheres subject to continuing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tia|TIA|T.I.A.">transient ischaemic attacks</z:e> was significantly impaired (mean 1.6%/mm Hg), suggesting that the cerebral symptoms in some of these patients may have had a haemodynamic origin more often than suspected from the clinical history </plain></SENT>
