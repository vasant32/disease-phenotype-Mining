<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For this reason, after its first description made in 1976 by Stoney and String, it raised general interest among vascular surgeons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In spite of the efforts to clear the causes of this phenomenon, none of the numerous papers published in the literature has defined a specific cause determining restenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, at present, this hyperplastic response of the arterial wall to trauma after operation is generally considered benign because it is rarely responsible for new neurological symptoms or early internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This unanimous conviction has been achieved after years of instrumental and clinical postoperative follow-up performed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> over the world </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At the same time and probably for these reasons, recently, a new discussion has begun about the usefulness and cost-effectiveness of prolonged Duplex scanning postoperative surveillance of the endarterectomized carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This new question raised our curiosity in verifying the validity of this new approach, so we reviewed accurately our laboratory follow-up registry and the data regarding <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, evolution and clinical outcome of early restenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data associated with a meticulous review of the experience of other authors convinced us that the patients operated on, need, in most cases, a short even aggressive period of careful follow-up (generally the first six months).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
