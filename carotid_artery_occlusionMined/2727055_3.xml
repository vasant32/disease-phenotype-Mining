<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intraperitoneal treatment with either GM-1 monosialoganglioside or its inner <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">ester</z:chebi> AGF-2 started 1 h after release of carotid clamps and was repeated twice a day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="28892">Ganglioside</z:chebi> treatment was effective in reducing the increase of cerebral water content, nonetheless AGF-2 reduces significantly not only <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo>, but also <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> efflux and calcium overload </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With respect to ischemic untreated rats, GM-1- and AGF-2-treated rats showed a higher incidence of conditioned response retention of a single training trial, associated with improvement in cerebral blood flow and electrocorticographic patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, 4 weeks following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, the extent of tissue <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> was reduced, although not statistically significant, in both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28892">ganglioside</z:chebi>-treated groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these improvements are more evident in the AGF-2-treated rats than in the GM-1-treated ones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, these results suggest that, except in some cases with different potency, both monosialoganglioside GM-1 and its inner <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">ester</z:chebi> derivative, AGF-2, are able to improve outcome after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
