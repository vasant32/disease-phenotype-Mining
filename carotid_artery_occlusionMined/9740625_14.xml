<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have searched to define the major arterial parameters that determine aortic systolic (Ps) and diastolic (Pd) pressure in the dog </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Measured aortic flows were used as input to the 2-element windkessel model of the arterial system, with peripheral resistance calculated as mean pressure divided by mean flow and total arterial compliance calculated from the decay time in diastole </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The windkessel model yielded an aortic pressure wave from which we obtained the predicted systolic (Ps,wk) and diastolic (Pd,wk) pressures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These predicted pressures were compared with the measured systolic and diastolic pressures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The measurements and calculations were performed for 7 dogs under control conditions during aortic occlusion at 4 locations (the trifurcation, between the trifurcation and diaphragm, the diaphragm, and the proximal descending thoracic aorta) and during occlusion of both carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Under <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> conditions studied, the predicted systolic and diastolic pressures matched the experimental ones very well: Ps,wk=(1.000+/-0.0055) Ps with r=0.958 and Pd,wk=(1.024+/-0.0035) Pd with r=0.995 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Linear regression for pulse pressure (PP) resulted in PPwk=(0.99+/-0.016) PP with r=0.911 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We found the accuracy of prediction equally good under control conditions and in the presence of aortic or carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multiple regression between pulse pressure and arterial resistance and total arterial compliance yielded a poor regression constant (R2=0.19), suggesting that the 2 arterial parameters alone cannot explain pulse pressure and that flow is an important determinant as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that for a given ejection pattern (aortic flow), 2 arterial parameters, total arterial resistance and total arterial compliance, are sufficient to accurately describe systolic and diastolic aortic pressure </plain></SENT>
