<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A retrospective review of the clinical course surrounding internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (ICO) was undertaken in 97 patients with 106 instances of ICO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>No neurologic symptoms could be attributed to more than half of the ICOs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of the 52 symptomatic occlusions, 19 (37%) were associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> and 33 (63%) with fixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Only 10% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients had permanent disabling neurologic sequelae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between development of neurologic symptoms and the side of the ICO, the presence or severity of contralateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery disease</z:e>, or other risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Women, however, were twice as likely as men to develop a fixed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> with ICO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seventy-six of these patients underwent reconstructive carotid surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although there was a high rate of abnormal intraoperative findings with electroencephalographic monitoring (32 of 62 cases), with the use of intraoperative shunts there was no increase in the postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> complication rate (1.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that the concern that ICO leads to serious fixed neurologic deficits may be overestimated, and that its presence does not adversely affect carefully performed contralateral carotid endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
