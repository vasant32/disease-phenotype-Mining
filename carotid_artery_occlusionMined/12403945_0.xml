<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it is presently difficult to predict how the bypass flow will contribute to intracranial circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined intracranial hemodynamics by transcranial color-coded duplex sonography (TCCD) after superficial temporal artery (STA)-middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) bypass and retrospectively studied the relationship between the postoperative contribution of the bypass flow and the preoperative collateral circulation and cerebrovascular perfusion status in 10 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hemodynamics in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> detected by TCCD were classified into three patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In pattern A, perfusion of the whole <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> area is completely dependent on the bypass flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In pattern B, perfusion of the M2 segment is dependent on the bypass flow, but perfusion of the M1 segment is independent of the bypass flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In pattern C, perfusion of the whole <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> area is supplied by collateral flow and the bypass does not function efficiently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Preoperative absence of collateral flow via anterior communicating artery and cerebral perfusion status type 3 (reduced regional cerebral blood flow and regional cerebral vasoreactivity) seems to predict hemodynamic usefulness of the bypass flow after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>TCCD is an easy and noninvasive method for evaluating intracranial cerebral circulation after EC-IC bypass surgery </plain></SENT>
