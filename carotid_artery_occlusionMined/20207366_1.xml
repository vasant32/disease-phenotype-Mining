<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a non-invasive optical method for assessing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (Hb) oxygenation parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of NIRS parameters as prognostic markers of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> occurrence in patients with CAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty-five patients (46 men, mean age 68.8 years) with CAO were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Forty-two patients had previous cerebrovascular events (15 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>, 27 minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>), the remaining 23 were asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> subjects underwent simultaneous TCD and NIRS examination at rest and after <z:mp ids='MP_0002318'>hypercapnia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients completed follow-up (median, 36 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During follow-up, 11 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cerebral VMR measured by TCD had a prognostic role in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> occurrence (p=0.042) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The increase in Hb oxygen saturation detected by NIRS during <z:mp ids='MP_0002318'>hypercapnia</z:mp> predicted the occurrence of new cerebrovascular events, although without an overt significance (p=0.058) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Hb oxygen saturation at rest, however, failed to be of prognostic value (p=0.65) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: NIRS is potentially useful in monitoring cerebral oxygenation; however, at present NIRS does not effectively predict the outcomes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in patients with CAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This study does confirm the primary role of TCD VMR in the outcome of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0741975" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
