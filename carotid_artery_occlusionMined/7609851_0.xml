<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>3-D transcranial Doppler was used for estimation of mean velocities and pulsatility index in the middle cerebral artery, anterior cerebral artery and posterior cerebral artery before and after iv injection of 1 g <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The anterior cerebral artery was the supplying vessel to the occluded side in 16 patients and mean velocities were significantly (p &lt; 0.001) faster on the occluded (59.3 +/- 14.5 cm sec-1) and nonoccluded (91.6 +/- 29.6 cm sec-1, p &lt; 0.05)) side than those found in the middle cerebral artery (39.2 +/- 13.7 and 50.9 +/- 8.5 cm sec-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In two patients a decrease of mean velocity after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> was noted in middle cerebral artery indicating 'steal' effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In another 4 patients, poor vasomotor response was seen with less than 11% of mean velocity increase in the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Differences between posterior cerebral artery on the occluded and nonoccluded side were insignificant as well as those between middle and posterior on the occluded side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Resting values of pulsatility index differed significantly (p &lt; 0.01) only between anterior and posterior cerebral artery on the nonoccluded side.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
