<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When anesthesia was discontinued after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia, transient</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>hyperthermia</z:hpo> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In animals with 0- and 15-min postischemic <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi> anesthesia, both cranial and rectal temperature rose by approximately 1.5 degrees C, and the number of surviving CA1 neurons amounted to less than 25% of control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After 45- or 85-min postischemic anesthesia, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>hyperthermia</z:hpo> was significantly reduced and the number of surviving neurons increased to 65 and 89%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The protective effect of postischemic anesthesia was lost when anesthetized animals were submitted to the same hyperthermic profile as nonanesthetized ones, using a feedback-controlled heating system (16% surviving neurons in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>hyperthermia</z:hpo> vs. 89% in normothermia, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These observations demonstrate that postischemic anesthesia with 1% <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi> protects against delayed neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> by preventing postischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>hyperthermia</z:hpo> and not by its <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anesthetic</z:chebi> effects </plain></SENT>
