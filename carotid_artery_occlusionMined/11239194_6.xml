<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We sought to investigate whether in patients with a symptomatic internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion, endarterectomy of a severe stenosis of the contralateral carotid artery can establish long-term cerebral hemodynamic improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Nineteen patients were studied on average 1 month before and 6 months after contralateral carotid endarterectomy (CEA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Volume flow in the main extracranial and intracranial arteries was measured with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Collateral flow via the circle of Willis and the ophthalmic arteries was studied with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography and transcranial Doppler sonography, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cerebral metabolism and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16526">CO(2)</z:chebi> vasoreactivity were investigated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> spectroscopy and transcranial Doppler sonography, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twelve nonoperated patients with a symptomatic ICA occlusion and contralateral ICA stenosis, who were matched for age and sex, served as control patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In patients who underwent surgery, flow in the operated ICA increased significantly (P:&lt;0.05) and flow in the basilar artery decreased significantly (P:&lt;0.01) after CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On the occlusion side, mean flow in the middle cerebral artery increased significantly from 71 to 85 mL/min (P:&lt;0.05) after CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of collateral flow via the anterior communicating artery to the occlusion side increased significantly (47% before and 84% after CEA; P:&lt;0.05), while the prevalence of reversed ophthalmic artery flow on the operation side decreased significantly (42% before and 5% after CEA; P:&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the hemisphere on the side of the ICA occlusion, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> was no longer detected after CEA in 80% of operated patients, whereas it was no longer detected over time in 14% of nonoperated patients (P:&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="16526">CO(2)</z:chebi> reactivity increased significantly in operated patients in both hemispheres (P:&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Contralateral CEA in patients with a symptomatic ICA occlusion induces cerebral hemodynamic improvement not only on the side of surgery but also on the side of the ICA occlusion </plain></SENT>
