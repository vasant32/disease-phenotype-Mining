<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanism by which ischemic events trigger the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and progression of AD is poorly understood </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To clarify whether cholinergic disturbance is implicated in the exacerbation of AD symptoms by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairment</z:hpo> and hippocampal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi> release were examined in young (4-6 month-old) Tg2576 (Tg) mice, an AD transgenic mouse model, and in age-matched control mice with or without transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> (bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>: 2VO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>2VO induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairment</z:hpo> and decreased high-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi>-evoked <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi> release in Tg mice, but not in control mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in memory and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi> release between sham-operated control and Tg mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Increases in β-amyloid (Aβ) 40 and Aβ42 were also observed in 2VO-operated Tg mice compared with sham-operated Tg mice, but no evident amyloid plaques or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo> were found in the hippocampus of these mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the memory of Tg mice is affected by 2VO, and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairment</z:hpo> may be due to cholinergic dysfunction induced by Aβ </plain></SENT>
