<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinical histories were reviewed in 58 patients with apparent occlusion of an internal carotid artery diagnosed by Doppler/ultrasound who also underwent angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>False-positive results were detected in eight patients, for an overall accuracy of 86% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among a group of 25 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cerebral or ocular events ipsilateral to an apparently occluded artery, false-positive results occurred in seven (accuracy of 72%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among a group of 33 patients with asymptomatic or remotely symptomatic apparent occlusions, only one false-positive occurred, for an accuracy of 97% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This difference in accuracy between groups was significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, a Doppler/ultrasound diagnosis of occlusion was most inexact in those patients for whom the detection of continued patency was most likely to influence management </plain></SENT>
