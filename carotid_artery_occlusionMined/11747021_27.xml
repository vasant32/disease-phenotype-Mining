<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of five healthy volunteers and five patients with unilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Only magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) images were acquired for the volunteer group while both <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography (PET) images were acquired for the patient group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Assessments of CBF from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteers compared favorably with values reported in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, while a linear relationship was observed for each patient when <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> measured CBF was compared to that obtained from PET, this linear relationship diminished when <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were analyzed as a group (r = 0.41) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A correction factor (CF) was proposed that was equal to the ratio of the area of the venous output function (VOF) in each patient to the mean VOF obtained from the volunteer group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After globally scaling the CBF of each patient based on the experimentally derived CF, a substantial improvement was observed (a slope of 1.02 and r = 0.8 for the linear regression line) in the relationship between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> estimated CBF and those obtained from PET </plain></SENT>
