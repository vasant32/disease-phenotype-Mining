<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Postoperative angiogram showed the patency of the anastomoses in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No serious surgical complications were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The outcome on discharge was excellent, with no morbidity and one mortality which was due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027051" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MR|mi|AMI">cardiac infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the follow-up study, there were four cases with ischemic symptoms, two with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> and two with completed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, one of which was a supratentorial infarction due to internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and the other was a small infarction of pons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were also two <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027051" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MR|mi|AMI">cardiac infarction</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Favorable outcomes were obtained for the remaining cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The present study suggests that, STA-SCA bypass, can be performed without surgical and systemic complications and used as an effective therapy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042568" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vertebrobasilar ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
