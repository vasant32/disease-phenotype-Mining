<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thromboendarterectomy of the occluded carotid artery resulted in unacceptably high mortality and morbidity rates, and long-term patency of the internal carotid artery was rarely achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Carotid endarterectomy on the side opposite the occlusion proved to be successful in relieving nonlateralizing symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, whereas results were less encouraging in patients with focal symptoms in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>External carotid artery reconstruction on the side of the occlusion was successful in relieving focal symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Surgical treatment in patients with symptomatic internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> should be planned in each patient on the basis of symptoms and anatomic pattern </plain></SENT>
