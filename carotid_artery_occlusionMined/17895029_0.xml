<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The objective of this study was to elucidate the effect of intravenous administration of nicardipine on the cerebral blood flow of hypertensive patients with internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (ICAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Six patients with ICAO and 10 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals were examined by <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume (CBV), cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen, oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) and CBF/CBV ratio were evaluated for each vascular territory and each hemisphere, and the interhemispheric asymmetry index of each parameter was also calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nicardipine was administered intravenously to each patient, and the changes in CBF (DeltaCBF%) and in blood pressure (DeltaBP) were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After the administration of nicardipine, the CBF was significantly increased in the patient hemisphere and was unchanged in the occluded hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Stepwise regression analysis disclosed that the DeltaBP and asymmetry index of OEF were significantly correlated with the DeltaCBF% in the occluded hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that CBF is unchanged or increased in ICAO patients after nicardipine administration, but that excessive reduction of blood pressure may lead to CBF decrease in the patients with marked hemodynamic imbalance between the occluded and patent hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that it is advisable not to reduce blood pressure excessively in these patients in the treatment of perioperative or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> with calcium <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
