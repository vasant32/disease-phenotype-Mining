<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To determine the principal effects of brain angiotensin(Ang) II on the sympathetic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system, vasopressin (AVP), and the high and low pressure baroreceptor systems, we observed the hemodynamic and neurohumoral characteristics induced by the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>(1-hr) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo>(1-wk) infusion of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48432">Ang II</z:chebi> into the brain ventricle in conscious dogs, and then evaluated the hemodynamic responses to sole-innervated carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>(COR) after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48432">Ang II</z:chebi> infusion and again after vagotomy in anesthetized dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>(50ng/kg/min) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo>(15ng/kg/min) infusion of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48432">Ang II</z:chebi> caused a significant rise in arterial pressure without changes in heart rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neither <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> nor <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48432">Ang II</z:chebi> treatment produced significant changes in plasma renin activity and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid(CSF), while the plasma and CSF level of AVP was increased in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48432">Ang II</z:chebi> treatment, but not in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48432">Ang II</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The COR was blunted in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48432">Ang II</z:chebi> treatment compared with those obtained in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48432">Ang II</z:chebi> or sham treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The blunted pressor response to carotid occlusion in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48432">Ang II</z:chebi> treatment was restored by cutting the remaining vagus nerve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that baroreceptor reflexes are impaired by the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> excess of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48432">Ang II</z:chebi> in the brain, and it might be mediated through increased vagal afferent activity, changes in the central integration of low and high pressure baroreceptors, and a combination of both </plain></SENT>
