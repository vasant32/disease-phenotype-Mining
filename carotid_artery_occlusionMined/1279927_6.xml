<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The topical and temporal relationship between neuronal injury and calcium loading was investigated in gerbils following bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> for 5 or 10 min and recirculation times from 15 min to 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The association of histochemically visible calcium deposits with neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was assessed by combining two calcium stains, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16866">alizarin red</z:chebi> and arsenazo III, with conventional histological techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neuronal calcium accumulation was evaluated morphometrically in the striatum, the frontoparietal cortex and the CA1 and CA4 sectors of the hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After 5-min <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and 1-2 days of recirculation numerous calcium-containing neurons appeared in the CA4 sector but only a few were present in the CA1 sector </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 4 days of recirculation calcium accumulation was visible in the whole CA1 sector and the dorso-lateral part of striate nucleus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After 10-min <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> calcium accumulation started in these regions, as well as in the cortex, already after 1 day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the CA1 sector calcium accumulation followed a typical time course: on day 2 only the lateral parts were affected, while on day 4 the whole CA1 neuronal band was calcium positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The regional distribution of histological lesions matched that of calcium loading and, furthermore, the lesions appeared after a corresponding delay in the respective regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Morphometric evaluations of calcium staining and histological lesions in the CA1 sector revealed a high correlation, indicating that calcium accumulation and neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> are closely associated both topically and temporally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This suggests that disturbances of calcium homeostasis such as those measured by this histochemical technique are the consequence of and not the reason for ischemic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
