<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe two recent patients in whom the parent artery spontaneously occluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One patient had severe stenosis of the left internal carotid artery, with delayed appearance of a faint shadow of vascular widening near the posterior clinoid process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One month later, complete occlusion of the left internal carotid artery was shown angiographically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The second patient had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001260'>dysarthria</z:hpo> and left <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo>, resulting in the diagnosis of a left internal carotid artery giant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>He had suffered an episode of visual disturbance of the right eye 5 years before </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Angiography showed the right cervical internal carotid artery to be occluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We believe the mechanism of parent <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in our two patients to be due first to stretching of the internal carotid artery by the enlarged <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, followed by compression of the internal carotid artery by the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> itself </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Next, the anterior clinoid process and the optic nerve are involved, and, finally, <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the aneurysmal cavity extends into the internal carotid artery itself </plain></SENT>
