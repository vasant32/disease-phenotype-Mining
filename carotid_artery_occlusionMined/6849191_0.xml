<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It not only supplies blood via periorbital collaterals with retrograde flow in the ophthalmic artery, but also may allow emboli to reach the retina or brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cul-de-sac or "stump" created by internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> may frequently be the source of emboli causing <z:hpo ids='HP_0100576'>amaurosis fugax</z:hpo> or hemispheric transient ischemic episodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seven such patients presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100576'>amaurosis fugax</z:hpo> and/or hemispheric transient ischemic episodes were found at operation to have atherosclerotic ulceration or platelet fibrin debris at the carotid bifurcation and the internal carotid artery cul-de-sac </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These patients were treated by external carotid endarterectomy with excision and closure of the occluded internal carotid artery cul-de-sac to remove a potential source of stasis and platelet <z:mpath ids='MPATH_179'>fibrin deposition</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A preoperative angiogram and intraoperation photograph demonstrating the typical pathologic findings are presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The surgical technique emphasizing excision and closure of the internal carotid cul-de-sac is illustrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Six of the seven patients have remained asymptomatic with a 2- to 28-month follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The importance of considering microembolism as a cause of symptoms in some patients without external carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> is stressed </plain></SENT>
