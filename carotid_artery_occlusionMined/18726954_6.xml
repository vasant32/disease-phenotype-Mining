<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: This study was conducted to determine if carotid stenting (CS) could be safely performed in the elderly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Age has been shown to be a predictor of neurological complications during CS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We postulated that CS could be safely performed in elderly patients if certain anatomical and clinical markers such as excessive <z:hpo ids='HP_0004948'>vascular tortuosity</z:hpo>, heavy concentric calcification of the lesion, and decreased cerebral reserve were avoided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From July 2003 to October 2007, 142 patients aged &gt; or =50% or asymptomatic stenosis &gt; or =70% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent carotid and cerebral angiography to determine anatomic suitability and stent risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Demographic and outcome data were entered into a database; other data were obtained retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Independent neurology evaluation was performed before and at 24 hr after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean age was 83.2 years, 62% were male, 25.5% were symptomatic, 8.5% had postcarotid endarterectomy restenosis, and 6.0% had contralateral internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhages</z:hpo> or periprocedural <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarctions</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One patient had <z:hpo ids='HP_0100576'>amaurosis fugax</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were two minor and three major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> in-hospital (3.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had 30-day follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>One of the major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> expired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Thus the overall 30-day <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate was 3.3% and major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate was 2.0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The 30-day <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate was 5.1% for symptomatic patients and 2.6% for asymptomatic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CS can be performed safely in anatomically suitable elderly patients with low adverse event rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CS should remain a revascularization option in appropriately selected elderly patients </plain></SENT>
