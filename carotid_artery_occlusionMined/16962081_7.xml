<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two groups of rats were used, including normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rat and spontaneous hypertensive rat (SHR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Each group contained sham operation, 1 week and 4 weeks after bilateral CCA occlusion (n=5-10 in each time point) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The blood pressure showed a significant elevation in WKY rats from 1 h after operation to 4 weeks before sacrifice (P&lt;0.05), but was not changed in SHR (P&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, rectal temperature showed no significant change after operation in WKY rat and SHR (P&gt;0.05) and showed no significant difference at any time point between WKY rat and SHR (P&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">Hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin staining showed SHR had a significantly larger necrotic volume than WKY rats (n=10 in each group, 6044+/-6895 microm(3) vs. 144+/-174 microm(3), P&lt;0.05) at 4 weeks after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In SHR, BDNF immunoreactivity and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> decreased significantly from 1 week to 4 weeks in both the hippocampal CA1 and cortical areas (P&lt;0.01) but decreased transiently in dentate gyrus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, in WKY rats, BDNF immunoreactivity and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> decreased transiently at 1 week (P&lt;0.05) and recovered at 4 weeks after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our study demonstrates that after bilateral CCA occlusion, preexisting <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> may aggravate the brain injury and downregulate the expression of BDNF immunoreactivity and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-vulnerable hippocampal CA1 and cortical areas but not in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-resistant dentate gyrus </plain></SENT>
