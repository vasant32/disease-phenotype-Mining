<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 14 control dogs, right carotid sinus pressure was controlled by retrograde perfusion through the common carotid artery at constant flow with femoral arterial blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Graded reductions in heart rate and blood pressure induced by graded increases in carotid sinus pressure were prevented, whereas reflex <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardias</z:hpo> associated with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> pressor activity were potentiated by <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46631">clonidine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">Norepinephrine</z:chebi>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo>, although reduced, still persisted after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> bilateral sinusectomy and these responses were also potentiated by <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46631">clonidine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46631">clonidine</z:chebi> did not potentiate reflex <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> in dogs 20 days after aortic stripping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In intact dogs, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46631">clonidine</z:chebi> inhibited the response to bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and to carotid sinus nerve stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These studies suggest that <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46631">clonidine</z:chebi> can inhibit carotid sinus baroreceptor function and simultaneously potentiate other, presumably aortic, baroreceptor activity </plain></SENT>
