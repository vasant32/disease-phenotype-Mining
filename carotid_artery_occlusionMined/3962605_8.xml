<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The influence of hemodynamic factors was studied by evaluating the microcirculation before and at two times after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (3 min and 7 days), using Evans blue as an intravital vascular tracer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The density of perfused capillaries and the fractional volume of circulating blood were determined by quantitative morphometry and the values for the vulnerable CA 1 sector compared with those for the resistant CA 3 sector and cerebral cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In control animals the number of perfused capillaries in the CA 1 sector was about 20% lower, and the volume of circulating blood about 30% lower, than in the CA 3 sector or cerebral cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This difference was markedly enhanced after 5-min <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During the early recirculation phase, capillary perfusion improved in the cortex, whereas in the CA 1 sector (and to a lesser degree also in the CA 3 sector) it declined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After 7 days, the density of perfused capillaries and the volume of circulating blood had returned to control levels in the cerebral cortex and CA 3 sector of hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the CA 1 sector, in contrast, the microcirculation had further deteriorated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The density of perfused capillaries was less than 30%, and the circulating blood volume even less than 50%, of that in the cerebral cortex.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
