<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The authors studied the effect of carotid endarterectomy on blood velocity in the ophthalmic artery and in the central <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> artery (CRA) and central <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Pre- and postoperative ultrasonographic and preoperative angiographic determination of the internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> rate and orbital color Doppler imaging measurements were performed on 18 consecutive cases of carotid endarterectomy (17 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Most of the blood velocity values in the CRA improved and corresponded to the contralateral values postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The peak systolic (vp) and end diastolic velocity (edv) in the CRA and ophthalmic artery (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e>) increased significantly postoperatively (vpCRA: P = 0.027; edvCRA: P = 0.023; vpOA: P = 0.034; edv <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e>: P = 0.047) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Systolic acceleration in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e> also increased (P = 0.018) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the individual response was variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 81%, the ratio of vpCRA of the operation side and the contralateral side was higher postoperatively than preoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The flow increased also in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The flow was reversed in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e> in two cases and in both the direction of flow changed postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no increase in the peak velocity in the central <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Carotid endarterectomy resulted in significantly increased flow in the CRA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e>, but no effect was observed on the central <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> vein </plain></SENT>
