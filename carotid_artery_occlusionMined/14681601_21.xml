<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Carotid artery stenting has been proposed as an alternative to carotid endarterectomy in cerebral revascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although early results from several centers have been encouraging, concerns remain regarding long-term durability of carotid artery stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report the incidence, characteristics, and management of in-stent recurrent stenosis after long-term follow-up of carotid artery stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Carotid artery stenting (n = 122) was performed in 118 patients between September 1996 and March 2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Indications included recurrent stenosis after previous carotid endarterectomy (66%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1402294" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary lesions</z:e> in patients at high-risk (29%), and previous ipsilateral cervical radiation therapy (5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fifty-five percent of patients had asymptomatic stenosis; 45% had symptomatic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Each patient was followed up with serial duplex ultrasound scanning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Selective angiography and repeat intervention were performed when duplex ultrasound scans demonstrated 80% or greater in-stent recurrent stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Data were prospectively recorded, and were statistically analyzed with the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Carotid artery stenting was performed successfully in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, with the WallStent or Acculink carotid stent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thirty-day <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate was 3.3%, attributable to <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> infarction (n = 1), hemispheric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (n = 1), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (n = 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Over follow-up of 1 to 74 months (mean, 18.8 months), 22 patients had in-stent recurrent stenosis (40%-59%, n = 11; 60%-79%, n = 6; &gt; or =80%, n = 5), which occurred within 18 months of carotid artery stenting in 13 patients (60%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>None of the patients with in-stent recurrent stenosis exhibited neurologic symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Life table analysis and Kaplan-Meier curves predicted cumulative in-stent recurrent stenosis 80% or greater in 6.4% of patients at 60 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Three of five in-stent recurrent stenoses occurred within 15 months of carotid artery stenting, and one each occurred at 20 and 47 months, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Repeat angioplasty was performed once in 3 patients and three times in 1 patient, and repeat stenting in 1 patient, without complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>One of these patients demonstrated asymptomatic internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> 1 year after repeat intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Carotid artery stenting can be performed with a low incidence of periprocedural complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The cumulative incidence of clinically significant in-stent recurrent stenosis (&gt; or =80%) over 5 years is low (6.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>In-stent restenosis was not associated with neurologic symptoms in the 5 patients noted in this cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Most instances of in-stent recurrent stenosis occur early after carotid artery stenting, and can be managed successfully with endovascular techniques </plain></SENT>
