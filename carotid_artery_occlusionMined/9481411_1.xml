<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The aim of this article was to analyze the perioperative mortality and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk rates and late benefits of carotid endarterectomy (CE) contralateral to an occluded internal carotid artery (ICA), on the basis of our surgical experience from July 1990 to June 1996 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 57 (14.7%) of 336 patients undergoing 388 CEs, the contralateral ICA was occluded (group I) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> operations were performed under general anesthesia with selective shunting based on electroencephalographic criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Shunting was used in 36 (63.1%) of 57 revascularizations in group I and 47 (14.2%) of 331 operations performed on the remaining 279 patients with patent contralateral ICAs (group II) (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> occurred in two patients (3.5%) in group I and three patients (1%) in group II (difference not significant) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The only perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, which occurred in one patient (1.7%) in group I, was the result of a perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>; two patients (0.7%) in group II died within 30 days of operation (difference not significant) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Life-table cumulative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-free rates at 1, 3, and 5 years were 95%, 95%, 95% in group I and 98.8%, 98.2%, and 98.2% in group II, respectively (p = 0.272) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Life-table cumulative survival rates at 1, 3, and 5 years were 97.5%, 94.2%, and 78.1% in group I and 99.2%, 94.8%, and 71.7% in group II, respectively (p = 0.306) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results of this analysis indicate that CE contralateral to an occluded ICA can be performed with acceptable perioperative mortality and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk rates and late <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-free and survival rates comparable to those seen in patients without contralateral ICA occlusion who have undergone operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, we think it is misleading to imply that the risks of operating on the two groups are the same </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Moreover, because no late <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> occurred in patients with contralateral ICA occlusion, it would appear that superior late <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-free rates did not translate into a prolonged survival advantage </plain></SENT>
