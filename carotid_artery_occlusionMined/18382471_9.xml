<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, little is known about the spatial and temporal extent of the blood flow response in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> postischemic period after incomplete <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To investigate the relative cerebral blood flow (rCBF) response in the somatosensory cortex of rat to controlled vibrissae stimulation after transient incomplete <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (15-min bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>+<z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo>), we employed laser speckle imaging combined with statistical parametric mapping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that the ischemic insult had a significant impact on the baseline blood flow (P&lt;0.005) and the activation area in response to functional stimulation was significantly reduced after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (P&lt;0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The maximum rCBF response in the activation area determined from the statistical analysis did not change significantly up to 3 h after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (P&gt;0.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the time when rCBF response reached its maximum was significantly delayed (P&lt;0.0001) from 2.4+/-0.2 secs before <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> to 3.6+/-0.1 secs at 20 mins into reperfusion (P&lt;0.001); the delay was reduced gradually to 2.9+/-0.2 secs after 3 h, which was still significantly greater than that observed before the insult (P=0.04) </plain></SENT>
