<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report on two peculiar cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> due to the rupture of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>-like vessels associated with unilateral internal carotid occlusion at its origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The first case is 44-year-old male showing <z:mp ids='MP_0001917'>intraventricular hemorrhage</z:mp> associated with right internal carotid occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The second case is 58-year-old female presenting sub-arachnoid <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> associated with left internal carotid occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although both cases showed the unique appearance of collateral flow resembling <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>, they were not classified as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> nor unilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya</z:e>-like state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Vascular abnormality such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysm</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformation</z:hpo> were not at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The etiology of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> for both cases is presumed as the rupture of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e>-like vessels, however, it is unable for us to determine why the one case showed IVH, yet the other showed SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The two cases showed hypoperfusion of ipsilateral cerebral hemisphere on SPECT that followed by the external-internal carotid revascularization surgery in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Post operative study proved the improvement of the CBF reserve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, whether the reconstructive vascularization prevent an occurrence of rebleeding needs the longer observation and the accumulation of the resembling cases </plain></SENT>
