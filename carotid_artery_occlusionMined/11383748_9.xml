<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Recent advances in stent technology have allowed the introduction of more flexible stents that may be tracked more easily in the intracranial vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present a patient with improved cerebral blood flow and metabolism as assessed by <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography after stent-assisted angioplasty for symptomatic basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 62-year-old man, who had undergone left superficial temporal artery to middle cerebral artery bypass surgery for left internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> 10 years previously, presented with dizziness, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000622'>blurred vision</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233794" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">memory disturbance</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Angiography revealed severe stenosis of the proximal basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">Positron</z:chebi> emission tomographic scans revealed decreased cerebral blood flow associated with increased oxygen extraction fraction in the entire brain, particularly in the posterior circulation and the left middle cerebral artery territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Despite medical treatment, the patient experienced worsening visual disturbance and right-sided motor <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9588">Ticlopidine</z:chebi> and aspirin were used as antiplatelet agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, we used argatroban, which is a direct thrombin inhibitor, as an <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> during the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Predilation with a coronary artery balloon was performed, followed by placement of a GFX 3- by 8-mm stent (Arterial Vascular Engineering, Santa Rosa, CA), with excellent angiographic results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The patient made a good neurological recovery, and the postoperative <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomographic scan demonstrated increases in both cerebral blood flow and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen with a normalization of oxygen extraction fraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Stent-assisted angioplasty can provide a favorable clinical course as well as improved cerebral perfusion and metabolism for a patient with basilar <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Long-term follow-up data and additional clinical experience are required to assess the durability of this approach </plain></SENT>
