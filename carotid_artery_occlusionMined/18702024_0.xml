<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Duplex sonography showed an occlusion of the left common carotid artery as well as an open internal carotid artery due to retrograde flow from the external carotid artery into the internal carotid artery with pseudovenous flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Transcranial duplex sonography showed a pseudovenous flow in the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery, because of insufficient intracranial collateralisation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During operative revascularisation, a primary shunt from the aortic arch to the internal carotid artery was necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After revascularisation, perfusion of the left middle cerebral artery was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and the neurological symptoms abated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Revascularisation of a common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in case of progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> may be indicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The central position of the shunt and the surgical procedure described provide sufficient cerebral perfusion </plain></SENT>
