<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> attributable to extracranial internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion is frequently associated with severe disability or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In selected cases, revascularization with carotid artery stenting has been reported, but the safety, recanalization rate, and clinical outcomes in consecutive case series are not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the cases of ICA occlusions that underwent cerebral angiography with the intent to revascularize over a 38-month period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two groups were identified: (1) patients who presented with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> clinical presentation within 6 hours of symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> (n=15); and (2) patients who presented subacutely with neurologic fluctuations because of the ICA occlusion (n=10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-five patients with a mean age of 62+/-11 years and median National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) of 14 were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three of the 25 patients (92%) were successfully revascularized with carotid artery stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients in group 1 were younger and more likely to have a tandem occlusion and higher baseline NIHSS when compared with group 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients in group 2 were more likely to show early clinical improvement defined as a reduction of their NIHSS by &gt; or =4 points and a modified Rankin Score of &lt; or =2 at 30-day follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two clinically insignificant adverse events were noted: 1 asymptomatic <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> and 1 nonflow-limiting dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Endovascular treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ICA occlusion appears to have a high-recanalization rate and be relatively safe in our cohort of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ICA occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Future prospective studies are necessary to determine which patients are most likely to benefit from this form of therapy </plain></SENT>
