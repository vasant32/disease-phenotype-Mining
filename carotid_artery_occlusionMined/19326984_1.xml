<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: Preliminary experience with the C-Port Flex-A Anastomosis System (Cardica, Inc.) to enable rapid automated anastomosis has been reported in coronary artery bypass surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The goal of the current study was to define the feasibility and safety of this method for high-flow extracranial-intracranial (EC-IC) bypass surgery in a clinical series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a prospective study design, patients with symptomatic carotid artery (CA) occlusion were selected for C-Port-assisted high-flow EC-IC bypass surgery if they met the following criteria: 1) transient or moderate permanent symptoms of focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>; 2) CA occlusion; 3) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948268" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemodynamic instability</z:e>; and 4) had provided informed consent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Bypasses were done using a radial artery graft that was proximally anastomosed to the superficial temporal artery trunk, the cervical external, or common CA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> distal cerebral anastomoses were performed on M2 branches using the C-Port Flex-A system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Within 6 months, 10 patients were enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The distal automated anastomosis could be accomplished in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients; the median temporary occlusion time was 16.6+/-3.4 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Intraoperative digital subtraction angiography (DSA) confirmed good bypass function in 9 patients, and in 1 the anastomosis was classified as fair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was 1 major perioperative complication that consisted of the creation of a pseudoaneurysm due to a hardware problem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but 1 case the bypass was shown to be patent on DSA after 7 days; furthermore, in 1 patient a late occlusion developed due to vasospasm after a sylvian <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One-week follow-up DSA revealed transient asymptomatic extracranial spasm of the donor artery and the radial artery graft in 1 case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Two patients developed a limited zone of infarction on CT scanning during the follow-up course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with symptomatic CA occlusion, C-Port Flex-A-assisted high-flow EC-IC bypass surgery is a technically feasible procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The system needs further modification to achieve a faster and safer anastomosis to enable a conclusive comparison with standard and laser-assisted methods for high-flow bypass surgery </plain></SENT>
