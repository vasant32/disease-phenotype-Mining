<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The interrelation between the metabolic responses to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> propensity was studied in two groups of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> prone (SP) and non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> prone (NSP) gerbils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The metabolic state was evaluated in vivo using the light guide surface fluorometry as well as in the frozen brain scanned at liquid N2 temperature for Fp/PN ratio after monitoring the brain in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results could be summarized as follows </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>(1) Unilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> led to partial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in the ipsilateral hemisphere while the contralateral hemisphere remained normoxic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>(2) Animal variability in the degree of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> insult due to unilateral occlusion was not side dependent or in correlation with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> propensity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>(3) Significant correlation was found between the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16908">NADH</z:chebi> increase during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and the redox state measurements done in the same brain after funnel freezing with liquid nitrogen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>(4) In a large number of the gerbils (not depending on the origin or strain) a peculiar inter-hemispheric blood supply connection was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A narrow band (1 mm in width) of tissue near the midline obtained its blood via the same vessels supplying the contralateral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>(5) We did not find any correlation between blood vessel <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> to the brain and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> propensity </plain></SENT>
