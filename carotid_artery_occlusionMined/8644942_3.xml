<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The present study was designed to examine the effect of morphologic changes of the arteries of the circle of Willis on cerebral blood flow (CBF) and metabolism in young spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CBF in the parietal cortex was measured by the hydrogen clearance method before and during a one-hour bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (BCO), and supratentorial brain metabolites were determined by standard enzymatic methods at a one-hour BCO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The internal diameters of the main arteries of the circle of Willis were estimated morphologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With increase in age, systemic arterial pressure at rest was significantly raised, while cortical CBF tended to decrease and calculated cerebral vascular resistance increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During BCO, CBF and supratentorial metabolism (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="15422">adenosine triphosphate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> ratio) tended to be better preserved in two-month-old rats as compared with those in one- or three-month-old rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The internal diameter of the posterior communicating artery (PcomA) was significantly smaller in the one-month-old group than in the other groups, while the diameter of the internal carotid artery was significantly smaller in rats aged three months than those in rats aged one or two months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is indicated that cortical CBF reduction and impairment of supratentorial metabolism following occlusion of carotid arteries, at least in part, depend on the morphologic changes of the arteries of the circle of Willis associated with age and development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> in young SHR </plain></SENT>
