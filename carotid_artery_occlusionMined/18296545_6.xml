<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therapeutic ICA occlusion, when tolerated, is an effective treatment resulting in improvement or cure of symptoms in most patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When ICA occlusion is not tolerated, selective endovascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> occlusion can be considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We compare recovery of cranial nerve dysfunction in patients treated with selective coil occlusion and with therapeutic ICA occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 16 patients with 17 large or giant (11-45 mm) unruptured ICA <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> presenting with dysfunction of cranial nerves <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29306">(CN)</z:chebi> II, III, IV, or VI, selective coil occlusion was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>From a cohort of 39 patients with ICA <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> treated with ICA occlusion and long-term follow-up, we selected 31 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> presenting with cranial nerve dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical recovery at follow-up from oculomotor dysfunction and visual symptoms was compared for both treatment modalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 17 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> treated with selective coiling, symptoms of cranial nerve dysfunction resolved in 3, improved in 10, and remained unchanged in 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 9 of 17 patients, additional coiling during follow-up was required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of 31 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> treated with carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, cranial nerve dysfunction resolved in 19, improved in 9, and remained unchanged in 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These differences were not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were no complications of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Recovery of ICA <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>-induced cranial nerve dysfunction occurs in most patients, both after ICA occlusion and after selective coiling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In patients who cannot tolerate ICA occlusion, selective aneurysmal occlusion with coils is a valuable alternative </plain></SENT>
