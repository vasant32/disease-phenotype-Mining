<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Summary of Report- We report that 5-minute bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (BCCAO) in the mouse prompted reduction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volumes triggered 24 hours later by 20-minute middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pharmacological PARP-1 inhibition between BCCAO and MCAO did not impair preconditioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The contents of the PARP-1 substrate <z:chebi fb="0" ids="13389">NAD</z:chebi>, those of its product poly(<z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="33942">ribose</z:chebi>), caspase-3 activation, and PARP-1 expression did not change after BCCAO within the preconditioned tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PARP-1 KO mice were similarly protected by the 5-minute BCCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Data demonstrate that, at variance with the heart, PARP-1 is dispensable for brain ischemic preconditioning </plain></SENT>
