<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Finally, we review the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A 62-year-old woman presented with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>; a computed tomography scan demonstrated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Angiography revealed that the bilateral common carotid arteries were occluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The muscle branches of the vertebral arteries had anastomosed to the bilateral external carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Bilateral posterior communicating arteries had developed and supplied the bilateral internal carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> (a saccular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the P1 portion of the left posterior cerebral artery and a wide-necked <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the basilar bifurcation) were also observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Endovascular embolization of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> was successfully performed using a double-balloon remodeling technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The patient made a full recovery after treatment, and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> remained obliterated 12 months after embolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We believe that this is the first report of ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> associated with bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> successfully treated by endovascular coiling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The double-balloon remodeling technique was useful for treatment of wide-necked basilar bifurcation <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
