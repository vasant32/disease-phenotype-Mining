<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study sought to evaluate factors that contributed to the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> during PercuSurge balloon occlusion and techniques used to allow successful completion of the CAS procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The PercuSurge occlusion balloon was used in 43 of 165 patients treated with CAS for high-grade stenosis (mean stenosis, 90%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 43 patients were at increased risk for endarterectomy (7 restenosis, 3 irradiation, 3 contralateral occlusion, and 30 Goldman class II-III); 20% were symptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1695782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral hypoperfusion</z:e> during temporary occlusion of the internal carotid artery occurred in 10 of 43 and included <z:hpo ids='HP_0001260'>dysarthria</z:hpo> (7/10), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000713'>agitation</z:hpo> (6/10), decreased level of consciousness (5/10), and focal hemispheric deficit (3/10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An incomplete circle of Willis or contralateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, or both, was present in 8 of 10 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Symptoms resulting from PercuSurge balloon occlusion were managed by balloon deflation with or without evacuation of blood from the internal carotid artery using the Export catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> symptoms resolved completely without deficit after deflation of the occlusion balloon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The development of neurologic symptoms after initial PercuSurge balloon inflation and occluded internal carotid artery flow was associated with a decrease in the mean Glasgow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>Coma</z:hpo> Scale (GCS) from 15 to 10 (range, 9 to 14); the GCS returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> after occlusion balloon deflation and remained <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> during subsequent reinflation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean time to spontaneous recovery of full neurologic function was 8 minutes (range, 4 to 15 minutes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No thrombotic or embolic events were present on cerebral angiography or computed tomography scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Balloon reinflation was performed after a mean reperfusion interval of 10 minutes after full neurologic recovery (range, 4 to 20 minutes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The mean subsequent procedure duration was 11.9 minutes (range, 6 to 21 minutes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No recurrence of neurologic symptoms occurred when the occlusion balloon was reinflated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 10 patients underwent successful CAS without occlusion, dissection, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accident</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Several factors may contribute to the development of neurologic intolerance during CAS with balloon occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Elucidation of the protective cellular mechanisms that invoke ischemic tolerance after the initial transient ischemic event may enable CAS with embolic protection in patients who cannot tolerate initial interruption of antegrade cerebral perfusion </plain></SENT>
