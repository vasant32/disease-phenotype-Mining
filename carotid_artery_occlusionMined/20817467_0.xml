<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The missing button sign (MBS) is defined as the absence of the ICA at the level of the foramen magnum on contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two raters independently reviewed random CECT samples from consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 399 patients with 798 carotid arteries were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rater A identified the MBS in 41 (5%) of the carotid arteries, and did not identify the MBS in 735 (92%) carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rater B identified the MBS in 45 (6%) of the arteries, and lack of the MBS in 731 (91%) arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The kappa value for agreement was 0.90 (95% CI 0.84-0.95) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with CT angiography, Rater A's sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for detecting proximal ICAO were 85%, 100%, 100%, and 99%, respectively, while Rater B's values were 87%, 99%, 93%, and 99%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study indicated that the MBS on CECT scanning is both a consistent and specific tool for the early identification of proximal ICAO </plain></SENT>
