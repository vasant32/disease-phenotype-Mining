<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We describe the effects of the 21-aminosteroid tirilazad mesylate (U-74006F) on postischemic <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of brain vitamin E) and cortical extracellular calcium recovery in gerbils subjected to 3 hours of unilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Male gerbils were treated with either 0.2 ml vehicle (0.05N HCl) or 10 mg/kg i.p </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>U-74006F 10 minutes before the induction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and again immediately after the initiation of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the first series of experiments, the brain concentration of vitamin E, which was unaffected by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> without reperfusion, was decreased after 2 hours of reperfusion by an average of 60% in vehicle-treated animals compared with sham-operated animals; in the U-74006F-treated gerbils, the 2-hour postischemic vitamin E loss was only 27% (p less than 0.002 different from vehicle-treated animals) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the second series, unilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> produced a decrease in the cortical extracellular calcium concentration from 1.05 mM before <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> to 0.11 mM by the end of the ischemic episode in both vehicle- and U-74006F-treated gerbils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After 2 hours of reperfusion, the calcium concentration had recovered to only 0.22 mM in the vehicle-treated animals compared with 0.56 mM in the U-74006F-treated group (p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cortical blood flow, mean arterial blood pressure, and blood gases did not differ significantly between the two treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Administration of only the immediate postreperfusion dose (i.e., no pretreatment) also significantly improved the recovery of cortical extracellular calcium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that U-74006F inhibits postischemic <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation as assessed by the preservation of brain vitamin E and that, secondary to this membrane-protective effect, the processes responsible for the reversal of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-triggered intracellular calcium accumulation are preserved </plain></SENT>
