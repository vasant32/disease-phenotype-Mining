<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These patients were divided into three groups according to contralateral carotid status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Group 1 consisted of 58 patients who had contralateral occlusion; group 2, 53 patients who had contralateral stenosis and bilateral staged surgery; and group 3, 583 patients who had nonstenotic contralateral internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> groups were similar with regard to age and sex ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were more asymptomatic patients in group 3 than in group 1 (39.9% vs. 25.8%) (p &lt; 0.05), and less preoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> in group 2 than in the other groups (3.7% vs. 17.2% and 13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>6%, respectively) (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among risk factors, smoking was less frequent in group 3 (59.5%) than in group 1 (82.7%) and group 2 (77%) (p &lt; 0.01), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> was more frequent in group 2 (60%) than in group 1 (32.7%) and Group 3 (26.4%) (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>EEG changes occurred more frequently in group 1 (25.8%) than in group 2 [5.6% (first stage) and 3.8% (second stage)] and in group 3 (4.9%) (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A shunt was used only when EEG changes did not disappear after pharmacologic increasing of central blood pressure, which occurred more frequently in group 1 (10.3%) than in group 2 (0%) and group 3 (0.3%) (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The combined morbidity/mortality rate was similar for groups 1 and 3 (1.7% and 1.5%, respectively), however, transient morbidity was more frequent in group 1 (6.9%) than in group 3 (1.5%) (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The combined morbidity/mortality rate was higher in group 2 than in group 3 (7.5% vs. 1.5%) (p &lt; 0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>05), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> in group 2 were seen during the second-stage operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, contralateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> had minimal influence over carotid surgery results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Selective use of a shunt based on EEG monitoring prevented <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo>, with minimal neurologic morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Contralateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> did not affect operative strategy for first stage, but we noted a higher incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> during the second procedure </plain></SENT>
