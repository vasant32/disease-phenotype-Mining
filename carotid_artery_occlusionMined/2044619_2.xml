<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied a pure and extreme example of this situation in a patient who presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> orbital infarction, but no <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> on clinical, CT and single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computerized tomography (SPECT) grounds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000618'>blindness</z:hpo> corresponded to <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi>, choroidal and optic nerve infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The pattern of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000602'>ophthalmoplegia</z:hpo>, with relative sparing of adduction, was more compatible with a muscle than a nerve dysfunction, but a reactive dilated pupil, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271291" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">corneal anesthesia</z:e>, and orbital pain suggested that the intraorbital branches of the ocular motor nerves and ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve were not spared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, signs of widespread ocular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> were present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sequential examinations documented the evolution pattern over 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The absence of an orbital collateral supply from the contralateral external carotid and muscular cervical arteries systems, which contrasted with an adequate middle cerebral artery supply via the contralateral internal carotid artery, may explain this isolated and complete form of orbital <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> due to common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
