<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16724">gamma-hydroxybutyrate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16724,30830">GHB</z:chebi>) on 1) <z:chebi fb="3" ids="25375">monoamine</z:chebi> metabolism, and 2) protein synthesis were examined in a gerbil <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="3" ids="25375">monoamine</z:chebi> metabolism was studied by occluding bilateral common carotid arteries for 15 minutes followed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16724,30830">GHB</z:chebi> administered intravenously 3 hours later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Tissue <z:chebi fb="3" ids="25375">monoamine</z:chebi> concentration was examined up to 8 hours after recirculation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three hours after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16724,30830">GHB</z:chebi> administration, <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> (<z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp>) had increased to almost twice that of the non-treated group, whereas homovanillic acid, a metabolite of <z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp>, did not show any significant difference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results may mean that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16724,30830">GHB</z:chebi> will facilitate <z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp> synthesis but that it has no influence on its release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, a <z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp>-mediated increase in cerebral blood flow in the cerebral cortex cannot be expected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Tryptophan, a precursor of 5-hydroxytryptamine (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5HT</z:chebi>), started to increase just after recirculation reaching a level of over four times that of the control value at 2 to 3 hours, and then starting to decrease in the non-treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This decline in tryptophan was markedly facilitated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16724,30830">GHB</z:chebi> administration within 1 hour </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5HT</z:chebi> administration within 1 hour </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5HT</z:chebi> increased only very slightly in the cerebral cortex 1 hour after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16724,30830">GHB</z:chebi> administration, the change ratio being 1/30 of tryptophan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It can therefore be speculated, that the decrease in tryptophan brought about by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16724,30830">GHB</z:chebi> administration is due to the improvement in disturbed protein synthesis rather than to stimulation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5HT</z:chebi> synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Protein synthesis was studied by administering <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16724,30830">GHB</z:chebi> 2 minutes prior to a 5-minute temporal common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Ninety minutes after recirculation animals were given a single dose of <z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>-leucine and further 60 minutes were allowed to pass before sacrifice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Autoradiographs of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16724,30830">GHB</z:chebi>-treated group were compared with those of the non-treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>With <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16724,30830">GHB</z:chebi> pretreatment, autoradiographs showed an increased uptake of <z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>-leucine in at least the hippocampus, thalamus, and hypothalamus, and in two out of three animals, there was diffusely increased uptake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Thus, it is speculated that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16724,30830">GHB</z:chebi> is effective in improving the protein synthesis in the postischemic period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The favorable function of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16724,30830">GHB</z:chebi> during <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> is regarded by many to be prevention of energy failure by reducing cerebral metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the results derived from the present study suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16724,30830">GHB</z:chebi> may improve protein synthesis in the postischemic period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Thus, we suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16724,30830">GHB</z:chebi> is useful if given at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> such as during internal carotid artery or middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
