<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two patients with CCA occlusion presented with ischemic symptom associated with the affected side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both patients underwent vascular reconstruction by direct carotid endarterectomy to achieve primary restoration of CCA to ICA flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Successful reopening of the vessels was obtained in both patients without the evidence of postsurgical ischemic event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Follow-up MRA was obtained at later than 6 months after surgery, which demonstrated patent CCA-ICA in both patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Direct carotid endarterectomy of the occluded CCA can be safely performed if the preoperative angiography suggest still patent vessels distal to carotid bifurcation and the substantial "back flow" is obtained from ICA during arteriotomy </plain></SENT>
