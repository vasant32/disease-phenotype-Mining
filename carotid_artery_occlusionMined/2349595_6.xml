<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To enhance the consistency of the ischemic insult caused by reversible transorbital middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, we investigated the variability of somatosensory evoked potential amplitudes and regional cerebral blood flow in 26 anesthetized cats using four procedures to induce <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">transient ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These procedures included 60 minutes of left middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> with or without left common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and 120 minutes of left middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> with or without bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Blood flow in the left middle cerebral artery territory was markedly and consistently reduced to less than 20 ml/min/100 g with simultaneous occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery and both common carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The standard deviation of blood flow with this procedure (5.4) was less than that with the other three procedures (13-25) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The amplitudes of ipsilateral somatosensory evoked potentials were decreased to approximately 20% of control during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During reperfusion, amplitudes recovered more slowly, to half of control, after both procedures involving 120 minutes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After 120 minutes of reperfusion, the range of amplitudes was smallest in the group exposed to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> with bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The degree of recovery of the somatosensory evoked potentials correlated with residual blood flow in both the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery territory and in the white matter during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the most consistent model of focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and reperfusion in cats in which there is partial recovery of somatosensory evoked potentials is occlusion of one middle cerebral artery and both common carotid arteries for 120 minutes </plain></SENT>
