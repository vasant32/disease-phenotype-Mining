<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We examined metabolic and functional changes when forebrain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was induced in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats by bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, the protective effect of clentiazem was evaluated in this model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Rats were anesthetized with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="17967">urethane</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow was measured with a laser Doppler flowmeter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cerebral high-energy phosphates and intracellular pH were measured by <z:chebi fb="81" ids="28659,35895">phosphorus</z:chebi> magnetic resonance spectroscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Electroencephalographic activity was evaluated as the summation of its amplitude </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These parameters were monitored during a 30-minute period of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and recirculation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Clentiazem was given orally as pretreatment (10 mg/kg twice a day for 3.5 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Bilateral carotid occlusion caused a decrease in cerebral blood flow to approximately 5% of the preischemic level and the disappearance of electroencephalographic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Occlusion also caused a decrease in ATP and phosphocreatine (to 48.7 +/- 4.3% and 23.7 +/- 2.2% of preischemic levels, respectively) as well as intracellular pH (from 7.3 +/- 0.1 to 6.0 +/- 0.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>During recirculation the reversal of these changes was variable: high-energy phosphates were partially restored, but electroencephalographic activity and intracellular pH showed little improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Hypoperfusion (55.7 +/- 11.5% of the preischemic flow) developed after reactive hyperemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment with clentiazem lessened the decrease in cerebral blood flow (control, 4.8 +/- 1.4%; clentiazem, 14.1 +/- 4.1% of the preischemic level; P &lt; .05) and prevented the disappearance of electroencephalographic activity in some rats during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Clentiazem also prevented postischemic hypoperfusion and accelerated the restoration of high-energy phosphates, intracellular pH, and electroencephalographic activity during recirculation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> induced stable forebrain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Clentiazem improved the metabolic and functional disturbances that occurred in this ischemic model, and its beneficial effect appeared to be due mainly to the relative preservation of cerebral blood flow during carotid occlusion </plain></SENT>
