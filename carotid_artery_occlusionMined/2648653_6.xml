<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To further study the effects of these ions on postischemic histologic outcome, fasted rats were given one of three intravenous infusions: 5.0 mmol/kg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6636">MgCl2</z:chebi>, 5.0 mmol/kg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6636">MgCl2</z:chebi> + 0.035 units/kg regular insulin, or 1.0 mmol/kg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3312">CaCl2</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This resulted in elevated plasma Mg2+ or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> concentrations in the corresponding groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A fourth group received 0.9% <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi> (saline) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Preinfusion plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration was similar for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups and was unchanged after infusion in rats receiving either saline or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6636">MgCl2</z:chebi> + insulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, postinfusion <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration was increased in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6636">MgCl2</z:chebi> group (p less than 0.001) and decreased in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3312">CaCl2</z:chebi> group (p less than 0.001) relative to saline-treated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Following respective infusions, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> rats underwent 10 minutes of reversible forebrain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo>) followed by 7 days' recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Six of 12 CaCl2-treated rats died 2-3 days after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other rats remained neurologically indistinguishable, without gross neurologic deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Histologic injury in the neocortex and caudate was moderate in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the hippocampus, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6636">MgCl2</z:chebi> + insulin resulted in 66 +/- 6% (mean +/- SD) dead CA1 pyramidal cells, which was similar to the amount in saline-treated rats (68 +/- 10%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Injury was increased in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6636">MgCl2</z:chebi> group (79 +/- 4% dead cells), while in surviving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3312">CaCl2</z:chebi>-treated rats, injury was decreased (54 +/- 13%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the increased injury in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6636">MgCl2</z:chebi>-treated rats and the decreased injury noted in surviving rats receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3312">CaCl2</z:chebi> are due to the plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentrations present prior to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
