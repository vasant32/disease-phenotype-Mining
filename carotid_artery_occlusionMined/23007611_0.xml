<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND Previous studies have not distinguished patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cervical internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusions from those with intracranial occlusions and often consider them together in the same cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES To evaluate the outcomes of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cervical ICA occlusion treated with intravenous thrombolysis or primary endovascular procedures and to identify early predictors of functional recovery among these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN Retrospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING Academic hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS We studied patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> who received intravenous thrombolysis or endovascular treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cervical ICA occlusion at St Mary's Hospital, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the associations of vascular risk factors, severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, arterial recanalization, presence of tandem occlusions, and collateral distal flow with functional recovery at 90 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Favorable functional recovery (Modified Rankin Scale score, 0-2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS We identified 21 patients (median age, 67 years; median National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale score at presentation, 13), of whom 13 patients received intravenous thrombolysis and 8 patients underwent primary endovascular treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three patients who received intravenous thrombolysis underwent rescue endovascular treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Favorable functional recovery (Modified Rankin Scale score, 0-2) was observed in 7 patients who received intravenous thrombolysis and in 1 patient who underwent primary endovascular treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Good collateral distal flow and intracranial tandem occlusions were observed in 6 patients and 12 patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Good collateral distal flow, observed more frequently in cigarette smokers, was associated with favorable functional recovery (odds ratio, 20; 95% CI, 2-242; P = .02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS Intravenous thrombolysis should be administered as first-line treatment in patients with early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cervical ICA occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Treatment benefits are accentuated in patients with better collateral circulation </plain></SENT>
