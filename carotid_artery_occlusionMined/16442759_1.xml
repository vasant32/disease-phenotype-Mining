<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The present study was designed to evaluate the hypotensive properties and the mechanisms of action of the stem bark aqueous extract of Musanga cecropioides R.Br </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Apud Tedlie (MCW) in anesthetized rats of Sprague-Dawley strain, through an invasive direct blood pressure measuring procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty adult rats, weighing 150-230 g, were grouped into five groups of six rats each </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effects of the intravenous graded doses (0.0005-0.05 mg/kg) of the extract on the blood pressure indices were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Its underlying mechanisms were also studied using additional five groups of rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the extract caused a dose dependent fall in the systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="35861">DBP</z:chebi>), mean arterial pressure and heart rate of the rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (BCO) caused a reflex increase in mean arterial pressure and heart rate which were significantly attenuated by the extract injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) blockade with 5 mg/kg of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3380">Captopril</z:chebi> and cholinergic blockade with 0.2 mg/kg of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="16684">atropine</z:chebi> significantly attenuated the hypotensive response to MCW </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the pattern of MAP fall in rats pretreated with a combination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8461">Promethazine</z:chebi> (1 mg/kg) and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3699">Cimetidine</z:chebi> (15 mg/kg) was not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results of the study was able to demonstrate dose dependent hypotensive effect of MCW and that its vasorelaxant effects may be through inhibition of sympathetic, cholinergic control of the arterial pressure and most significantly through ACE blockade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, the phytochemical, elemental and toxicological studies of this potential <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> still needed to be investigated </plain></SENT>
