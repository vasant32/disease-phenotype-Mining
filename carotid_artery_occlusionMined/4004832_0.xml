<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The reactions of kidney function elicited by bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> were studied in six groups of chloralosed cats in which the Nn. vagi, the breathing reaction, the increase of the mean systemic arterial blood pressure, and the carotid body chemoreceptors were excluded successively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Carotid occlusion in the control animals caused a rise of the mean systemic arterial blood pressure, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>hyperventilation</z:hpo>, and an increase in renal <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> and water excretion, resulting from an inhibition of tubular reabsorption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Bilateral cervical vagotomy, relaxation and constant artificial ventilation only slightly modified this renal response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Inactivation of the carotid body chemoreceptors in vagotomized and constantly ventilated cats attenuated the <z:mp ids='MP_0006316'>natriuresis</z:mp> due to carotid occlusion regardless of the behaviour of the renal perfusion pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, keeping the mean arterial blood pressure during carotid occlusion constant by the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> technique also reduced the natriuretic reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cats with both inactivated carotid body chemoreceptors and constant renal perfusion pressure exhibited an antinatriuretic reaction during carotid clamping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>From these data it is concluded that in narcotized cats the natriuretic response during carotid occlusion is the result of both a stimulation of the carotid body chemoreceptors and the rise of the renal perfusion pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, in dogs this so-called carotid-sinus-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000103'>polyuria</z:hpo> seems to be induced solely by the increase of the systemic arterial blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The findings additionally indicated that the arterial chemoreceptors may be involved in the physiological daily control of renal <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> excretion already at <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> arterial oxygen tension under sea-level conditions </plain></SENT>
