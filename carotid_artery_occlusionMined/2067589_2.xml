<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The effects of carotid occlusion on the release of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamines</z:chebi> in the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) were investigated in anaesthetized cats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two aspects of the nucleus (rostral or intermediate NTS) were superfused bilaterally through push-pull cannulae with artificial CSF and the release of the endogenous <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="15" ids="33569">noradrenaline</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="47" ids="28918,33568">adrenaline</z:chebi> was determined in the superfusate radioenzymatically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The superfusion rate was 150 microliters/min or 800 microliters/min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In some experiments, superfusion of the intermediate NTS was carried out after denervation of the aortic arch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the rostral NTS superfused at a rate of 150 microliter/min, bilateral carotid occlusion led to a rise in blood pressure and decreased the release rate of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These changes continued after occlusion termination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The release rate of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="33569">noradrenaline</z:chebi> was transiently diminished during occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The release of this <z:chebi fb="39" ids="32952">amine</z:chebi> was also decreased after occlusion termination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The release rate of <z:chebi fb="47" ids="28918,33568">adrenaline</z:chebi> was not influenced during carotid occlusion, but it was found to be diminished after termination of the occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Superfusion of the rostral NTS at a rate of 800 microliters/min also reduced the release rate of <z:chebi fb="47" ids="28918,33568">adrenaline</z:chebi> after termination of carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the intermediate NTS (superfusion rate 150 microliters/min) similar effects of the carotid occlusion on the release rates of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="33569">noradrenaline</z:chebi> were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In this aspect of the NTS, denervation of the aortic arch abolished the decrease in the <z:chebi fb="15" ids="33569">noradrenaline</z:chebi> release during carotid occlusion, while the release rates of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="47" ids="28918,33568">adrenaline</z:chebi> were decreased during and after termination of the carotid occlusion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
