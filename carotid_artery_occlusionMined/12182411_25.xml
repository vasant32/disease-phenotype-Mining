<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The treatment of giant <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> is a challenge because of the limitations and difficulty of direct surgical clipping and endovascular coiling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe the indications, surgical technique, and complications of saphenous vein extracranial-to-intracranial bypass grafting followed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> parent vessel occlusion in the management of these difficult lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between January 1990 and December 1999, 29 patients with giant <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> underwent 30 saphenous vein bypass grafts followed by immediate parent vessel occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were 11 men and 18 women with a mean follow-up period of 62 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five patients harbored <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> involving the internal carotid artery, 2 had middle <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral artery aneurysms</z:hpo>, and 2 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> in the basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serial cerebral or magnetic resonance angiograms were obtained to assess graft patency and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> obliteration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 30 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were excluded from the cerebral circulation, with 28 vein grafts remaining patent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two patients had graft occlusions: one because of poor runoff and the other because of misplacement of a cranial pin during a bypass procedure on the contralateral side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Other surgical complications included one <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from a large <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e>, homonymous hemianopsia from <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of an anterior choroidal artery after internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, and temporary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> from a presumed perforator <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> adjacent to a basilar <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: With appropriate attention to surgical technique, a saphenous vein extracranial-to-intracranial bypass followed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> parent vessel occlusion is a safe and effective method of treating giant <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A high rate of graft patency and adequate cerebral blood flow can be achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>Thrombosis</z:mp> of perforating arteries caused by altered blood flow hemodynamics after parent vessel occlusion may be a continuing source of complications </plain></SENT>
