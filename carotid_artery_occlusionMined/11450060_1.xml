<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In gerbil brain subjected to repeated unilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, the tissue ATP content, pH and succinic dehydrogenase activity decreased at different rates after the circulation had been restored in various cerebral regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Light microscopical infarction became apparent at different rates following the impairment of the energy metabolism in these regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In brain cortex with selective neuronal <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp>, only minor alterations in energy metabolism were detectable over a 7-day period following the restoration of the circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The present data show that the rate of energy failure is significantly different in various cerebral regions after repeated periods of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in the gerbil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A slowly evolving impairment of the cerebral energy metabolism after circulation of the brain has been restored appears to be indispensable for the delayed formation of infarction after transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
