<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated the induction of ischaemic tolerance in the hippocampal CA1 neurones to transient forebrain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> following pretreatment with unilateral middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) in gerbils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Histological evaluation was carried out after 5 min bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (5BCO) in the gerbils with no MCAO pretreatment, MCAO pretreatment 3 days prior to 5BCO (MCAO-3d-5BCO), MCAO pretreatment 7 days prior to 5BCO and sham MCAO pretreatment 3 days prior to 5BCO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CA1 neurones were preserved at &gt; 40% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls only in the left hippocampus in the MCAO-3d-5BCO gerbils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CA1 neurones in the right side of MCAO-3d-5BCO gerbils as well as in both sides of animals in the other pretreatment groups almost completely disappeared after 5BCO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>While the exact mechanism remains to be resolved, pretreatment with focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> seems to induce ischaemic tolerance in neurones outside of the primary ischaemic lesion </plain></SENT>
