<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We propose that at early times after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, ischemic regions can be visualized as a subtle change in reflected light directly in thaw-mounted, dried 20 microm brain sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 15 male Sprague-Dawley rats, anesthetized with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi>, middle cerebral artery transection and permanent bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was performed and brains were processed in five different ways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Areas of reflective change (RC) on non-stained sections were compared with areas on the adjacent sections delineated by microtubule associated protein 2 (MAP2) antibody, a reliable marker for early post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, in five rats each at 1, 3, and 6 h after focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A statistically significant correlation between ischemic areas (IA) measured on non-stained brain sections (IA(RC)) and adjacent sections immunostained (IM) with MAP2 Ab (IA(IM)) (IA(RC)=0.05+0.88.IA(IM); R2=0.8; n=15; P&lt;0.01) and a small mean difference +/-2 S.D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>(-0.9+/-6.0%) indicated that the area measured on non-stained sections reflects the IA measured on MAP2 -IM sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At 1 and 3 h after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, the ratio between ischemic regions measured on the non-stained sections and on the adjacent sections immunostained with MAP2 Ab were not different from 100% (97.6+/-1.7%, 100.9+/-6.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At 6 h post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, the IA measured on the non-stained sections was larger than on the IM sections (109.8+/-2.7%, P&lt;0.01, compared to 100% ratio) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our study demonstrated that this quick and simple method for detection of damaged brain permitted the use of brain tissue for other assays and could be very useful for neuroprotective evaluation and for directed micro-sampling of brain tissue at early times after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
