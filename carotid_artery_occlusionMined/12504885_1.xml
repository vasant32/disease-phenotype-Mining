<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study we investigated for the first time the susceptibility of this neuronal population to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Temporary focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was produced using a three-vessel occlusion method involving unilateral middle cerebral artery and bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO/CCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Most of the 3-h ischemic period was maintained without anesthesia and reversed by microclip removal of the contralateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In one subset of rats transcardial perfusion with India ink was used to estimate the degree of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> produced during MCAO/CCAO in the SON, lateral magnocellular nucleus of the PVN (PVL), caudoputamen (CP), and frontoparietal cortex (COR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Computer-assisted densitometry measurements of ink density indicated significant reductions in ink penetration in the territory of the occluded <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> within the SON (46%), PVL (45%), CP (53%), and COR (76%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, neither sham-operated rats nor rats subjected to occlusion of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> alone showed differences in ink optical densities between the sides ipsilateral and contralateral to MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The other subset of rats were perfused 48-72 h after recovery and brain sections were examined for neurodegenerative changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>While the incidences of cerebral and caudoputamen infarction after MCAO/CCAO were 98.4 and 52%, respectively, the histological features of the SON or PVL in ischemic rats were similar to those of control rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Reduced susceptibility of magnocellular neuroendocrine cells to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> may be due to a number of mechanisms including neuronal resilience, neuroprotection by glia and vascular/perivascular cells, and access to perivascular cerebrospinal fluid </plain></SENT>
