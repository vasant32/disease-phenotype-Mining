<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Prior to their relatively recent FDA approval, detachable balloons for endovascular <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> had been available on only a limited basis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the feasibility of permanent endovascular carotid and vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> using microcoils deployed with and without proximal flow arrest in 19 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Permanent endovascular occlusion was performed in 19 arteries of 19 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The treated lesions included nine <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, one carotid-cavernous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath>/pseudoaneurysm, seven <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo>, and two dissections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nondetachable balloons were used to arrest proximal blood flow during occlusion of only six arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Anticoagulation (<z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>, 5000 U IV) was used during occlusion of 18 arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three to 88 coils were used per lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Complex fibered <z:chebi fb="240" ids="33364,33400">platinum</z:chebi> microcoils were used for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, and GDCs were also used in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixteen patients had no new neurologic deficits after <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No patient had an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> event that suggested an embolic complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Coils provided rapid and durable <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> in 17 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In both patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> carotid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0155760" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">artery rupture</z:e>, large numbers of coils placed during flow arrest failed to produce complete occlusion, which was accomplished subsequently with detachable balloons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>One of these patients incurred a fatal hemispheric <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> after occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>One patient treated for a ruptured posterior inferior cerebellar artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> by vertebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> continued to have progressive neurologic deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>One patient with a cavernous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> had upper extremity <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> and mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002357'>dysphasia</z:hpo> 24 hours after internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In our small series, microcoils were found to be safe and effective for neurovascular occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>When both intravenous <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> (5000 U IV bolus) and heparinized catheter flush solutions (5000 U/L) are used, flow arrest during coil placement is unnecessary to prevent clinically apparent embolic complications </plain></SENT>
