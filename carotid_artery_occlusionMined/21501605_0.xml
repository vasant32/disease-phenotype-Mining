<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine whether forsythiaside has neuroprotective activity on transient cerebral global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in gerbil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was induced by bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> for 5 min and followed by reperfusion for 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Oral administration of forsythiaside was conducted immediately after reperfusion and once a day over the next 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The forsythiaside administration significantly increased the number of viable neurons detected by neuronal nuclei immunostaining and decreased degenerating neuronal cells detected by Fluoro-Jade B staining in the hippocampal CA1 region, at the 7th day post-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Forsythiaside also significantly decreased the number of ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule-1-detected activated microglia and glial fibrillary acidic protein-detected astrocytes, both of which were increased after ischemic insults, and decreased interleukin-1β and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-α expression levels, which were also increased after the insults (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, forsythiaside significantly improved <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairments</z:hpo> in the Y-maze task (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that forsythiaside exhibits neuroprotective properties, which are, in part, mediated by its anti-inflammatory activities supported by forsythiaside-induced reductions of activated glial cells and expression levels of interleukin-1β and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-α </plain></SENT>
