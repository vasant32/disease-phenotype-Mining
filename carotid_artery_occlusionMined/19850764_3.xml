<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The natural course of symptomatic carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> with hemodynamic impairment is poor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Surgical revascularization may improve the outcome; however, its efficacy has not been established yet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The goal of this study was to characterize the technical and clinical outcomes following endovascular recanalization of the ICA under cerebral circulatory protection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Endovascular recanalization was attempted in 8 patients with symptomatic ICA occlusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The duration of the occlusion ranged from 7 days to 7 months (mean, 2.5 months), and the mean length of the occlusion was 95 mm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cerebral hemodynamics ipsilateral to the side of the occlusion were severely impaired in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The endovascular procedure was performed under total cerebral circulatory protection, beginning with proximal protection with a subsequent switch to distal protection after successful guidewire passage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The occlusion was recanalized successfully in 7 of 8 patients (88%), resulting in improvement of ipsilateral cerebral hemodynamics without symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Small asymptomatic ischemic lesions were detected in 6 of 8 patients (75%) on DWI, and 1 patient developed a mild groin <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ischemic episodes did not recur during the mean follow-up period of 19 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, 1 patient experienced asymptomatic reocclusion, which was re-treated successfully without complications, while another patient developed mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0000573'>retinal hemorrhage</z:hpo> at 3 months after the procedure due to the combination of antiplatelet and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Endovascular revascularization of an ICA occlusion is feasible and well-tolerated in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> total occlusion of the ICA </plain></SENT>
