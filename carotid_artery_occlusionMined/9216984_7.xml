<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been speculated that, when elicited in an underperfused or otherwise energy-compromised tissue, such depolarization waves lead to cell damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We assessed under what conditions the calcium transients during <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32588">KCl</z:chebi>-induced SDs are prolonged, and explored if marked prolongation of the transients leads to brain damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow (CBF) was reduced by marked <z:mp ids='MP_0003032'>hypocapnia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Tissue oxygenation was reduced by arterial <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>, without or with unilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, or by occlusion of the carotid arteries in normoxic, anaesthetized rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals the DC potential and extracellular calcium concentration (Ca2+e) were measured before and during a series of SDs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The animals were recovered for histopathological assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>Hypoxia</z:mp> alone (Pao2, 32.5 +/- 3.8 mmHg) increased mean and total depolarization times, but repeated SDs elicited over 1.7 (+/-0.4) h failed to induce cell damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Unilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> further prolonged the SD waves but, in spite of total depolarization times of up to 40 min during 2 h, only two out of seven animals showed damage, localized to caudoputamen and parietal cortex, as well as to the subiculum, CA1 and CA3 sectors of the hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was associated with the most pronounced prolongation of the DC potential shifts and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> transients, with total depolarization times of up to 70 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In spite of this, only four out of 13 animals showed brain damage and in two of these the damage was contralateral </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The results justify modification of the hypothesis stating that SD-like depolarizations in the perifocal penumbra zone per se is what leads to gradual recruitment of such tissues in the infarction process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that additional factors are required, such as a larger reduction in CBF, or the proximity of cells at risk to necrotic tissue </plain></SENT>
