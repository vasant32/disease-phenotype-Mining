<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Results of clinical studies in which microdialysis has been used, however, have shown only modest changes in the levels of extracellular ions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The object of this study was to measure [K+]e and [<z:chebi fb="1" ids="29101">Na+</z:chebi>]e by using ion-selective electrodes (ISEs) and to compare these measurements with those obtained using the well-established method of microdialysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifteen Sprague-Dawley rats were separated into three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five animals were subjected to a 15-minute period of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, and another five animals to a 60-minute period of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>; animals in both of these groups received K+-free microdialysis perfusate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The third group of five rats underwent a 60-minute period of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and received a reduced-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="29101">Na+</z:chebi> microdialysis perfusate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Transient forebrain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was produced by bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> combined with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A custom-fabricated glass <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29101">Na+</z:chebi> electrode and a flexible plastic K+ and reference electrodes were used to monitor extracellular ion transients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Microdialysis samples were obtained with the aid of a 2-mm microdialysis probe that was perfused with K+-free mock cerebrospinal fluid at a rate of 2 microl/minute </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Baseline measurements of [K+]e and [<z:chebi fb="1" ids="29101">Na+</z:chebi>]e, obtained using ISEs, were 3.41 +/- 0.09 mM and 145 +/- 7.75 mM. respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Ischemia</z:e> resulted in a rapid accumulation of [K+]e (in animals subjected to 15 minutes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, the concentration was 41.9 +/- 13.7 mM; and in animals subjected to 60 minutes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, the concentration was 66.9 +/- 11.5 mM), with a concomitant decrease in [<z:chebi fb="1" ids="29101">Na+</z:chebi>]e (in animals subjected to 15 minutes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, the concentration was 71.7 +/- 2.9 mM; and in animals subjected to 60 minutes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, the concentration was 74.7 +/- 1.9 mM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A comparison of microdialysis and ISE methods revealed that microdialysis underestimated the [K+]e changes and was insensitive to concomitant [<z:chebi fb="1" ids="29101">Na+</z:chebi>]e alterations that occur during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the flexible ISE is a reliable and accurate tool for monitoring ionic dysfunction that accompanies brain injury </plain></SENT>
