<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The clinical outcome in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> associated with internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion is poor, although a minority may recover without dependency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purposes of this study were (1) to assess the predictive factors of adverse outcome in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> associated with an occlusion of the ICA and (2) to evaluate the rate of spontaneous recanalization of an occluded ICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 177 consecutive patients with first-ever <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> associated with ICA occlusion were prospectively examined from the Perugia <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mean age was 71.4 +/- 14.3 years; 53% were males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multiple regression models were used to analyze predictors of mortality, dependency and ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The most probable cause of occlusion was <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in 65%, cardioembolism in 22%, dissection in 9% and other causes in 4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirty percent of the patients died within 30 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After a mean follow-up of 420 days (range 1-1,970 days), 45% of the patients had died and 75% had died or were disabled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Another 6% of the patients had a recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> ipsilateral to the occluded carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Age was the only predictor of 30-day mortality (77.7 +/- 9.7 vs. 68.7 +/- 15.2 years; p = 0.03) and of long-term mortality or disability (p &lt; 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>Hypertension</z:hpo> (OR 0.42; 95% CI 0.17-1.00; p = 0.05) was associated with a better outcome within 30 days from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Previous ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (OR 0.24; 95% CI 0.06-0.89; p = 0.03) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo> (OR 0.38; 95% CI 0.15-0.99; p = 0.049) were predictors of a better outcome with respect to long-term mortality or disability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No predictors of ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrence were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>One hundred and five out of 177 patients had adequate follow-up ultrasound data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>After a mean follow-up of 1.8 years, 10 patients had recanalization of the occluded ICA (2/71 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo>, 3/19 cardioembolism and 5/15 dissection) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: After a mean follow-up of 1.2 years, 45% of the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> associated with ICA occlusion had died, while 75% had died or were functionally dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The presence of either previous ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo> was associated with a favorable outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Recanalization of an occluded ICA occurred in a minority of patients and it was associated with cardioembolism and with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005294'>arterial dissection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
