<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Eupatilin, a pharmacologically active <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42491">flavone</z:chebi> derived from the Artemisia plant species, has been reported to have anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-allergic, and anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we investigated whether eupatilin exhibits neuroprotective activities against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion-induced delayed neuronal injury in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Transient global <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was induced in mice by bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (BCCAO) for 15 min followed by reperfusion for 4 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eupatilin (1, 3, or 10 mg/kg, p.o.) was administered immediately after the reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Histochemical studies showed that eupatilin (10 mg/kg) increased the number of viable cells detected by Nissl staining and decreased the number of degenerating neuronal cells detected by Fluoro-Jade B staining in the hippocampal CA1 region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Western blotting indicated that eupatilin further increased the level of Akt phosphorylation at 8h after BCCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52289">wortmannin</z:chebi>, a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor, attenuated the eupatilin-induced increase of Akt phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52289">wortmannin</z:chebi> completely reversed the eupatilin-induced neuroprotective effects observed at 4 days after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that eupatilin is a promising therapeutic agent against global <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-induced neuronal damage and that its neuroprotective effects may be mediated in part by increased Akt phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
