<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the incidence, baseline characteristics, and clinical prognosis of blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) disruption after endovascular therapy in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 220 patients treated with endovascular therapy between April 2007 and October 2011 were identified from a prospective, clinical, thrombolysis registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent a nonenhanced CT scan immediately after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CT scan or MRI was systematically realized at 24 hours to assess <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> disruption was defined as a hyperdense lesion on the posttreatment CT scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> disruption was found in 128 patients (58.2%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 51.4%-64.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cardioembolic etiology, high admission NIH <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale score, high blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> level, internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, and use of combined endovascular therapy (chemical and mechanical revascularization) were independently associated with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> disruption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> disruption had lower rates of early major neurologic improvement (8.6% vs 31.5%, p &lt; 0.001), favorable outcome (39.8% vs 61.8%, p = 0.002), and higher rates of 90-day mortality (34.4% vs 14.6%, p = 0.001) and hemorrhagic complications (42.2% vs 8.7%, p &lt; 0.001) than those without <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> disruption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>By multivariable analysis, patients with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> disruption remained with a lower rate of early neurologic improvement (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 0.28; 95% CI, 0.11-0.70) and with a higher rate of mortality (adjusted OR, 2.37; 95% CI, 1.06-5.32) and hemorrhagic complications (adjusted OR, 6.38; 95% CI, 2.66-15.28) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> disruption has a detrimental effect on outcome and is independently associated with mortality after endovascular therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> disruption assessment may have a role in prognosis staging in these patients </plain></SENT>
