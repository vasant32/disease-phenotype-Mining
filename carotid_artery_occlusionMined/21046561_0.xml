<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to clarify the effect of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> on pial collateral vessel development after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> hypoperfusion using spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In normotensive rats, unilateral common carotid artery (CCA) occlusion enlarged leptomeningeal collateral vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CCA occlusion also preserved residual cerebral blood flow (CBF) and attenuated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size after middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion 14 days later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, in SHR, CCA occlusion neither enlarged the leptomeningeal anastomosis nor showed protective effects after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, decreasing blood pressure using an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> AT1 receptor blocker restored the beneficial effect of CCA occlusion on collateral growth as well as on residual CBF and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size after <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Adaptive responses in CBF autoregulation curves observed 14 days after CCA occlusion in normotensive rats were impaired in untreated SHR, but were restored after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, SHR have impaired leptomeningeal collateral growth after CCA occlusion, but <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35674">antihypertensive</z:chebi> treatment restores the beneficial effect of CCA occlusion on collateral circulation </plain></SENT>
