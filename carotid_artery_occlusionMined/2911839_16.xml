<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have previously demonstrated that transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> induces marked decreases in concentrations of cytoskeletal proteins and have suggested putative involvement of calpain in the decrease of microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examine the effect of nilvadipine, a new <z:chebi fb="1" ids="38215">calcium channel blocker</z:chebi>, on protein degradation in gerbil brains after 5 minutes of bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and compare this effect with those of nimodipine and nicardipine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By densitometric quantification of the electrophoretically separated soluble proteins, mean +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e> MAP2 content in the hippocampus (14.4 +/- 1.8 micrograms/mg protein) was depleted (5.4 +/- 0.5 micrograms/mg, p less than 0.01) 4 days after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>; this <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> was significantly inhibited by 1 or 10 mg nilvadipine/kg/day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MAP2 content was also depleted in vitro when <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> nonischemic brain extract was incubated with calcium, but this degradation was not inhibited by the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38215">calcium channel blockers</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38215">calcium channel blockers</z:chebi> do not act directly on calpain but act at the calcium channels of neurons and may suppress activation of the enzyme and attenuate ischemic degradation of cytoskeletal protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found nilvadipine to be the most potent drug among those studied, and we believe it could be useful for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
