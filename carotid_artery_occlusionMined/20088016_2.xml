<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In 2007, a multispecialty society task force published a clinical expert consensus document (CECD) on carotid stenting (CAS), containing recommendations for appropriate patient selection and quality of care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The CECD also inspired creation of a large, national registry of carotid revascularization, the Carotid Artery Revascularization and Endarterectomy (CARE) registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our goal here was to investigate whether initial CAS procedures submitted to CARE conformed to CECD recommendations, and examine their clinical outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed CAS procedures for the period January 1, 2005 through December 31, 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These were grouped into those that conformed to CECD recommendations [CECD(+), n = 4,636, 79.8%] and those that did not [CECD(-), n = 1,168, 20.2%] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The CECD(+) patients were older than CECD(-) patients (71.5 +/- 10.3 vs. 67.6 +/- 10.3 years, P = 0.001, respectively), and more frequently had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">kidney disease</z:e> (46.9% vs. 17.8%, P = 0.001), <z:hpo ids='HP_0006528'>chronic lung disease</z:hpo> (33.0% vs. 12.4%, P = 0.001), ejection fraction &lt;or= 0.30 (13.5% vs. 5.5%, P = 0.001) and contralateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (12.7% vs. 4.6%, P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical outcomes at 30 days were similar, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (1.24% vs. 0.76%, P = 0.184), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (5.32% vs. 5.34%, P = 0.954), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, or MI (7.04% vs. 6.95%, P = 0.944) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Most CAS procedures submitted to CARE conformed to CECD recommendations for patient selection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For reported data, clinical outcomes at 30 days were similar for procedures meeting and those not meeting recommendations, and were similar to outcomes reported by other large registries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that acceptable patient selection criteria for CAS are employed as it expands beyond investigators into more widespread clinical practice </plain></SENT>
