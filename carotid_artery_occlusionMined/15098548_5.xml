<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The data from 13,316 patients with carotid artery-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and 33,149 patients with cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although racial disparities associated with carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> varied, overall, as compared with Caucasians, minorities suffered greater neurologic impairment and had poorer outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For example, among patients with carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, 62.5% of Caucasian patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0003470'>paralysis</z:hpo>, compared with 71.2% of African Americans, 69.1% of Hispanics, and 74.0% of Asian patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Poorer outcomes among African Americans and Hispanics coexisted with higher frequencies of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007774" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral artery disease</z:e> in these populations, suggesting possible etiologic factors related to <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and high cholesterol levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Etiologic factors contributing to disparities in the Asian population remain to be determined </plain></SENT>
