<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Ischemia</z:e> was induced by ipsilateral middle cerebral artery/common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and CBF was monitored continuously in the ischemic territory using laser-Doppler flowmetry during manipulation of SAP with I-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7596">nitroprusside</z:chebi> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In eight SHRs not subjected to focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, we demonstrated that 0.5% <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi> and the surgical manipulations did not impair autoregulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Autoregulation was partly preserved in ischemic brain tissue with a CBF of greater than 30% of preocclusion values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In areas where ischemic CBF was less than 30% of preocclusion values, autoregulation was completely lost </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Changes in SAP had a greater influence on CBF in tissue areas where CBF ranged from 15 to 30% of baseline (9% change in CBF with each 10% change in SAP) than in areas where CBF was less than 15% of baseline (6% change in CBF with each 10% change in SAP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings demonstrate that the relationship between CBF and SAP in areas of focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> is highly dependent on the severity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Autoregulation is lost in a gradual manner until CBF <z:hpo ids='HP_0002527'>falls</z:hpo> below 30% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In areas without autoregulation, the slope of the CBF/SAP relationship is inversely related to the degree of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
