<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The neurotrophin nerve growth factor (NGF) is produced by different cell types in the anterior and posterior eye, exerting a neuroprotective role in the adult life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The visual system is highly sensitive to NGF and the retina and optic nerve provides suitable subjects for the study of <z:hpo ids='HP_0007009'>central nervous system degeneration</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The model of bilateral carotid occlusion (two-vessel occlusion, 2VO) is a well-established model for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> brain hypoperfusion leading to brain capillary pathology, to retina and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000648'>optic nerve degeneration</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In order to study if a single intravitreal injection of NGF protects the retina and the optic nerve from degeneration during systemic circulatory diseases, we investigated morphological and molecular changes occurring in the retina and optic nerve of adult rats at different time-points (8, 30 and 75 days) after bilateral carotid occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We demonstrated that a single intravitreal injection of NGF (5 microg/3 microl performed 24 hours after 2VO ligation) has a long-lasting protective effect on retina and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000648'>optic nerve degeneration</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>NGF counteracts <z:mp ids='MP_0008067'>retinal ganglion cells degeneration</z:mp> by early affecting Bax/Bcl-2 balance- and c-jun- expression (at 8 days after 2VO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A single intravitreal NGF injection regulates the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011096'>demyelination</z:hpo>/remyelination balance after ischemic injury in the optic nerve toward remyelination (at 75 days after 2VO), as indicated by the MBP expression regulation, thus preventing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000648'>optic nerve atrophy</z:hpo> and ganglion cells degeneration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At 8 days, NGF does not modify 2VO-induced alteration in VEFG and related receptors <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The protective effect of exogenous NGF during this systemic circulatory disease seems to occur also by strengthening the effect of endogenous NGF, the synthesis of which is increased by vascular defect and also by the mechanical lesion associated with NGF or even vehicle intraocular delivery </plain></SENT>
