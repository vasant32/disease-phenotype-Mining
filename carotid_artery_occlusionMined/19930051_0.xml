<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To determine the predictors of efficacy, including magnetic resonance imaging information, for low-dose intravenous alteplase therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventy-eight patients were prospectively enrolled in a single <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Unit (SU) receiving alteplase at a dose of 0.6 mg/kg during the initial 27 months after its approval in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ischaemic changes and vascular lesions were identified using computed tomography, diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, and magnetic resonance angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Early ischaemic signs were assessed using the Alberta <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Program Early CT Score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median baseline National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale score of 78 patients was 12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 19 patients (24%), the National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale score improved by &gt;or=8 points at 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After multivariate adjustment, occlusion at the internal carotid artery (odds ratio 11.82, 95% confidence interval 1.73-142.74), Alberta <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Program Early CT Score on diffusion-weighted imaging &lt;or=6 (15.23, 1.88-351.50), and a lower National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale score (1.24, 1.08-1.47, per 1-point decrease) were inversely correlated with early improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four patients (5%) had symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At 3 months, 76 patients (98%) survived, and 36 of 78 patients (46%) overall, but only two of 19 patients (11%) with internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, had a favourable functional outcome, corresponding to a modified Rankin scale score &lt;or=1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After multivariate adjustment, internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (odds ratio 15.84, 95% confidence interval 3.12-128.69) and Alberta <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Program Early CT Score on diffusion-weighted imaging &lt;or=6 (15.62, 1.78-410.12) were independent predictors of poor outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Intravenous alteplase therapy at a dose of 0.6 mg/kg resulted in a relatively good overall outcome when compared with outcomes reported by western studies using an alteplase dose of 0.9 mg/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, patients with occlusion at the internal carotid artery did not respond to this low-dose alteplase therapy </plain></SENT>
