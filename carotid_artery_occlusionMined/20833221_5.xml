<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since the changes in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> currents in astrocytes and NG2 glia that accompany glial scar formation might influence tissue outcome by altering <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> ion homeostasis, we aimed to characterize the changes in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> currents in hippocampal astrocytes and NG2 glia during an extended time window of reperfusion after ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Global <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was induced in adult rats by bilateral, 15-min common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> combined with low-pressure oxygen ventilation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using the patch-clamp technique, we investigated the membrane properties of hippocampal astrocytes and NG2 glia in situ 2 hours, 6 hours, 1 day, 3 days, 7 days or 5 weeks after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Astrocytes in the CA1 region of the hippocampus progressively depolarized starting 3 days after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, which coincided with decreased Kir4.1 protein expression in the gliotic tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Other <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> channels described previously in astrocytes, such as Kir2.1, Kir5.1 and TREK1, did not show any changes in their protein content in the hippocampus after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>; however, their expression switched from neurons to reactive astrocytes, as visualized by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>NG2 glia displayed increased input resistance, decreased membrane capacitance, increased delayed outwardly rectifying and A-type <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> currents and decreased inward <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> currents 3 days after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, accompanied by their proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results show that the membrane properties of astrocytes after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> undergo complex alterations, which might profoundly influence the maintenance of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> homeostasis in the damaged tissue, while NG2 glia display membrane currents typical of proliferating cells </plain></SENT>
