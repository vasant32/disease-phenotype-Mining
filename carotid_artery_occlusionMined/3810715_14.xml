<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The right carotid artery was permanently ligated, and animals without gross neurological deficits ("symptom-negative" gerbils) were selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eight days and eight weeks after vascular ligation, cell counts of hippocampal neurons were carried out and correlated with regional blood flow and the acquisition of operant behaviour </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eight days after carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, learning behaviour was significantly impaired although the number of hippocampal neurons had not changed and blood flow had even increased above <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After eight weeks, learning behaviour and blood flow were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> but now a significant loss of pyramidal neurons was present in the CA1 and CA2 sectors of the hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our observations demonstrate that it is possible to detect subtle functional disturbances by appropriate behavioural investigation before manifestation of selective injury of the hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Recovery of integrative function, despite persistent cellular damage, provides further evidence for central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> plasticity </plain></SENT>
