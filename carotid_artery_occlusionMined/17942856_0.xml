<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The majority were white (77%) males (61%) with multiple atherogenic risk factors and suffering ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (57%) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Overall, 36 patients (31%) required contralateral carotid endarterectomy (CEA), with one (2.8%) perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, whereas 4 (3%) underwent ipsilateral external CEA without incident </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With 81% follow-up (mean 3.9 years), the overall mortality of the group was 46%; the annualized risk of ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was 1.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This study documents a significant risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and contralateral occlusive disease with ipsilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, which cannot be reliably predicted by clinical criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Duplex surveillance is valuable, but flow velocity measurements alone may be misleading </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Surgical endarterectomy can be performed with an acceptable rate of perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
