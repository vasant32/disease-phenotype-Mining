<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Perfusion imaging with dynamic susceptibility contrast <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging (DSC-MRI) has been used to evaluate hemodynamic status in patients with symptomatic occlusive cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to determine the hemodynamic changes occurring in asymptomatic patients with unilateral internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion by use of DSC-MRI with transcranial Doppler (TCD) measurement of the breath-holding index (BHI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Nine patients with asymptomatic unilateral ICA occlusion underwent DSC-MRI and TCD examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One patient was excluded from final analysis because of severe movement artifacts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On a separate workstation, regional cerebral blood volume (rCBV), regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), and regional mean time to peak (rMTT) were calculated on the basis of signal decay rate during the passage of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi> bolus through the sampled volume in the territory of the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>TCD-BHI was calculated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Six healthy subjects underwent the same <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> protocol as the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Compared with control subjects, patients with unilateral ICA occlusions had hemodynamic changes in the ipsilateral hemisphere: rCBF was significantly lower than in controls (P &lt;.01), and r <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> was significantly increased in both white (WM) and gray matter (GM) in the affected side (WM: P &lt;.01; GM: P &lt;.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No statistically significant difference in rCBV was found in the group of patients (occluded versus contralateral, P &lt;.1) or between the patient and control groups (occluded side versus controls, P &lt;.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The correlation of rCBV and BHI showed a strong relation of the two variables, showing a decrease of the latter when the former increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: DSC-MRI is a valuable tool for measuring hemodynamic changes in the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0741975" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid disease</z:e> with hemodynamic impairment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In our opinion, hemodynamic changes and efficiency of collateral pathways can be evaluated in occlusive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0741975" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid disease</z:e> by using paired measurement of BHI and DSC-MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In the patient group, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>-determined rCBV and TCD-determined BHI showed a significant inverse correlation, suggesting similar significance of the two indices </plain></SENT>
