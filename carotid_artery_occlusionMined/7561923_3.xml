<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine whether <z:hpo ids='HP_0007371'>atrophy of the corpus callosum</z:hpo> progresses in association with a deterioration in cerebral cortical oxygen metabolism after occlusion of the carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging and PET were used to serially evaluate six patients with occlusion of the unilateral internal carotid artery at intervals ranging from 12 to 50 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One patient had no symptoms, one had a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tia|TIA|T.I.A.">transient ischaemic attack</z:e>, and four had a minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had presented at most only <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0871456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">subcortical lesions</z:e> at the first evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During follow up, no patient showed extension of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0871456" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">subcortical lesions</z:e> or recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The initial total callosal area:skull area ratio for the patients was significantly less than that for 14 age matched <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The yearly decrease of callosal size in the patients, which differed significantly from zero and exceeded that in the controls, was significantly correlated with the deterioration in mean cerebral cortical oxygen metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three of the four patients who showed significant progression of callosal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> presented deterioration in haemodynamic states as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that in some patients <z:hpo ids='HP_0007371'>atrophy of the corpus callosum</z:hpo> progresses after occlusion of the carotid artery even in the absence of any overt episode of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and that this <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> is associated with deterioration in cerebral cortical oxygen metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>An increase in cerebral morphological changes with deterioration in cerebral metabolism related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> may occur after occlusion of the carotid artery, even in the absence of symptoms </plain></SENT>
