<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Carotid endarterectomy is usually delayed for 2 months following an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, but the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> may progress or a further <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> may occur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A randomized pilot study of urgent carotid surgery for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was undertaken to assess the feasibility of a definitive multicentre trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seven Manchester hospitals referred patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (less than 7 days previously), defined according to the Oxfordshire Community <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Project classification The carotid arteries were examined by portable continuous-wave Doppler ultrasonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with more than 50 per cent <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> on portable Doppler ultrasonography underwent colour duplex Doppler imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with more than 70-99 per cent <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> were randomized to urgent carotid surgery or best medical care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 593 patients were assessed over 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of these, 414 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, of whom 380 had probable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Complete ipsilateral internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was most common in patients with total anterior circulation <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (33 (28 per cent) of 117), whereas severe ipsilateral (70-99 per cent) stenosis was most common in partial anterior circulation <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (25 (20 per cent) of 128) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only 16 patients (one total and 15 partial anterior circulation <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath>) were fit enough for surgery and consented to randomization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A definitive trial of urgent carotid surgery would need to screen large numbers of patients but could focus on patients with partial anterior circulation <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
