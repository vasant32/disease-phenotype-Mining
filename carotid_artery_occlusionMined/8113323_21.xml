<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CMRg1 was determined using a modification of the Sokoloff technique with 2-deoxy-[<z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>]<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (2-DG) as the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35207">radioactive tracer</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CEU was determined using the Lowry decapitation technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seven-day postnatal rats underwent unilateral common carotid artery ligation, followed 4 h thereafter by exposure to 8% oxygen at 37 degrees C for 3 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At 1, 4, or 24 h of recovery, the rat pups underwent those procedures necessary for the measurement of either CMRg1 or CEU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 1 h of recovery, the CMRg1 of the cerebral hemisphere ipsilateral to the carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was 97% of the control rate (8.7 mumol 100 g-1 min-1) but was only 48% of the control in the contralateral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At 4 h of recovery, the CMRg1 was increased 49% above baseline in the ipsilateral hemisphere, decreasing thereafter to 84% of the control at 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The CMRg1 of the contralateral hemisphere normalized by 4 h of recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An inverse correlation between endogenous concentrations of ATP or phosphocreatine and CMRg1 in the ipsilateral hemisphere was apparent at 4 h of recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CEU in the ipsilateral cerebral hemisphere was 64 and 46% of the control (3.47 mmol approximately P/kg/min) at 1 and 24 h, respectively (p &lt; 0.05) and 77% of the control at 4 h of recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CEU in the contralateral hemisphere was unchanged from the control at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> measured intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Correlation of the alterations in CMRg1 with those in CEU at the same intervals indicated that substrate supply exceeds energy utilization during early recovery from <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
