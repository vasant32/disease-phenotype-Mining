<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These patients have been reported to be characterized by certain clinical and imaging findings, mainly with non-contrast enhanced computed tomography (CT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our purpose in this study was to find out whether CT angiography (CTA) information about the status of the cerebral vessels is helpful in the selection of patients who may benefit the most from thrombolytic therapy for acvte <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CTA was prospectively performed in 15 consecutive patients (6 women and 9 men; age range 44-83 years) with moderate or severe symptoms of hyperacute <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The clinical manifestations of the patient's condition and the findings on CTA were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three-dimensionally reconstructed CTA images of diagnostic quality could be obtained for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 15 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the 15 patients 14 had a vessel occlusion identified on CTA, which was consistent with and/or helpful for making the clinical diagnosis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 14 cases; one patient had an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the anterior communicating artery without detectable <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> on CTA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although a thrombolytic agent was not given because of CTA evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysm</z:hpo>, the patient nevertheless developed a massive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> during hospitalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ischemic symptoms reversed after CTA and before the initiation of thrombolytic therapy in 2 patients whose CTAs showed occlusion of secondary branch of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CTA can provide important information before the initiation of thrombolytic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Identification both of the occluded vessel and of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysm</z:hpo> is feasible with the use of CTA, which is particularly important if the <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysm</z:hpo> is a potential contraindication to thrombolytic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Occlusion of a secondary branch of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> and internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> are valuable prognostic predictors </plain></SENT>
