<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we examined the influence of the PI3K/Akt pathway in mediating the anti-apoptotic effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16118">berberine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation and reoxygenation of nerve growth factor-differentiated PC12 cells and primary neurons, and bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in mice were used as in vitro and in vivo <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that the anti-apoptotic effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16118">berberine</z:chebi> against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> were indeed mediated by the increased <z:chebi fb="27" ids="28659">phosphor</z:chebi>-activation of Akt (higher p-Akt to total Akt), leading to the intensified phosphorylation of Bad and the decreased cleavage of the pro-apoptotic protease caspase-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="16118">Berberine</z:chebi> action is specific for PI3K, rather than the upstream receptor tyrosine kinase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The anti-apoptotic effect is maintained in the presence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38637">tyrosine kinase inhibitor</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28088">genistein</z:chebi> and the epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor PD153035, but is suppressed by the PI3K inhibitor Ly294002 and the Akt inhibitor Akti-1/2.The unique PI3K regulatory subunit p55γ was upregulated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16118">berberine</z:chebi> during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion and was not blocked by these inhibitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We constructed a reporter plasmid to detect PI3K p55γ promoter activity and found that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16118">berberine</z:chebi> enhanced PI3K p55γ promoter activity during <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-reperfusion </plain></SENT>
