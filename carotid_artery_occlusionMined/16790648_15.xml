<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sixty-four male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to Group 1 (fentanyl and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17045,29796">N2O</z:chebi>/O2; control) and Group 2 (2.0 vol% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9130">sevoflurane</z:chebi> and O2/air) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin-stained brain sections eosinophilic hippocampal neurons were counted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Activated caspase-3 and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-regulating proteins Bax, Bcl-2, Mdm-2, and p53 were analyzed by immunostaining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No eosinophilic neurons were detected in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9130">sevoflurane</z:chebi>-anesthetized rats over time, whereas 9%-38% of the hippocampal neurons were eosinophilic (days 1-28) in control animals </plain></SENT>
