<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Postoperative corrected ophthalmic arterial pressures (COAP's) on the operated side in the carotid endarterectomy patients averaged 12.5 mm Hg higher than before surgery, the standard deviation being 4.9 mm Hg for clinically stable patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There was no significant change in COAP on the contralateral side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Several problems were encountered in closing down carotid clamps, the most potentially serious being a precipitous fall in COAP with the final adjustment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The current uses of OPG and similar techniques are reviewed, and potential neurosurgical applications are discussed </plain></SENT>
