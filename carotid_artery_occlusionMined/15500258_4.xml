<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previously, we revealed that Choto-san (Diao-teng-san in Chinese), a Kampo formula, is effective on vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> clinically, and the hooks and stems of Uncaria sinensis (Oliv.) Havil., a medicinal plant comprising Chotosan, has a neuroprotective effect in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, for the purpose of clarifying their effects in vivo, we investigated whether the oral administration of Choto-san extract (CSE) or U. sinensis extract (USE) reduces delayed neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion (i/rp) in gerbils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Transient forebrain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was induced by bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> for 4 min, and two doses (1.0% and 3.0%) of CSE or USE were dissolved in drinking water and provided to the gerbils ad libitum from 7 days prior to i/rp until 7 days after i/rp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It was found that 1.0% and 3.0% CSE treatments significantly reduced pyramidal cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in the hippocampal CA1 region at 7 days post i/rp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three percent USE treatment also inhibited pyramidal cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> significantly at 7 days after i/rp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">Superoxide</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="5" ids="22563">anion</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29191">hydroxyl radical</z:chebi> scavenging activities of the homogenized hippocampus at 7 days after i/rp in the 1.0% CSE- and 3.0% USE-treated groups were significantly enhanced compared to those of control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further, <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="39" ids="44785">peroxide</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16301">NO2-</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17632">NO3-</z:chebi> levels of the homogenized hippocampus at 48h after i/rp in the 1.0% CSE- and 3.0% USE-treated groups were significantly lower than those of control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the oral administration of CSE or USE provides a protective effect against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">transient ischemia</z:e>-induced delayed neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> by reducing oxidative damage to neurons </plain></SENT>
