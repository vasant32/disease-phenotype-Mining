<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To prospectively investigate whether intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0100620'>germinomas</z:hpo>, except large ones, can be cured with radiation doses lower than 50 Gy and to determine 10-year follow-up results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 1985 and 1995, 38 patients with intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0100620'>germinoma</z:hpo> diagnosed histologically or with established criteria were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Total radiation doses to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> site were 36 Gy after total removal, 40 Gy for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> less than 2.5 cm in diameter, 45 Gy for those 2.5-4.0 cm, and 50 Gy for those greater than 4.0 cm, with 1.6-1.8-Gy daily fractions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients underwent irradiation of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0677930" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">primary tumor</z:e> site or cerebrospinal axis (20-24 Gy), depending on findings at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No chemotherapy was allowed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients completed radiation therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirty-five patients were treated according to protocol, and three with relatively slow <z:mp ids='MP_0010537'>tumor regression</z:mp> or presence of a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cyst</z:mpath> received additional radiation (5-7 Gy, 50-52 Gy total) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ten-year overall and relapse-free survival rates were 91% and 95%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two patients developed meningeal dissemination, but none had local failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Treatment complications included <z:hpo ids='HP_0010762'>chordoma</z:hpo> in one patient and internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in another </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No treatment-related decline of performance status was observed in the other patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> volume-based radiation doses were effective, without risk of local failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Intracranial <z:hpo ids='HP_0100620'>germinoma</z:hpo> 4 cm or less in diameter can be cured with doses of 40-45 Gy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Investigation of further dose reduction seems worthwhile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Radiation therapy alone with these doses should be compared with ongoing chemotherapeutic protocols plus low-dose (24-30-Gy) irradiation in future studies </plain></SENT>
