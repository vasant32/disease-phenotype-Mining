<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Autoradiographic visualization of the Bmax (maximal binding capacity) and Kd (dissociation constant) of [3H]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17598">phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17598">PDBu</z:chebi>) and [3H]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="42471">forskolin</z:chebi> (FK) was performed after 30-min unilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in the gerbil brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These parameters and the local cerebral blood flow (CBF) were measured at the level of the caudate-putamen in the same brain using a digital image processing technique developed in our laboratory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The local CBF was measured at the end of the experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>[3H]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17598">PDBu</z:chebi> and [3H]FK were utilized as specific ligands to assess the activities of protein kinase C (PKC) and adenylate cyclase (AC), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The local CBF on the occluded side was severely reduced and ranged from 0.2 to 9.0 ml/100 g/min, whereas the local CBF on the non-occluded side exhibited a moderate reduction except in the midline regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Bmax values of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17598">PDBu</z:chebi> and FK were significantly increased not only on the occluded side but also on the non-occluded side in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> group as compared to the corresponding values in the sham group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the Kd value of each ligand remained unchanged in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that both the adenylate cyclase and protein kinase C systems may be significantly and diffusely activated in the initial stage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, severe hemispheric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase may induce severe perturbation of the second messenger systems in extensive bilateral regions </plain></SENT>
