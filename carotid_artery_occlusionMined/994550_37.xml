<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A series of 58 operations on 56 patients, in whom a branch of the superficial temporal artery was anastomosed to a branch of the middle cerebral artery (STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> bypass or Yasargil procedure), is reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These operations were performed chiefly for occlussions or for inaccessible stenotic lesions of the internal carotid or middle cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patency in eight patients operated on from April 1971 through November 1973 was low (25%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patency in patients operated on since July 1974 has been high (95%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There have been no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> and no major <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo> attributable to the surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The rationale for this procedure is considered in relationship to the <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp> of the cerebral circulation and the pathogenesis of syndromes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The operation appears to have a low morbidity in good-risk patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The role of this operation in managing common manifestations of cerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> such as focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tia|TIA|T.I.A.">transient cerebral ischemic attacks</z:e> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100576'>amaurosis fugax</z:hpo>, although not fully established, appears encouraging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The procedure seems useful for orthostatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> caused by multiple occlusions of major extracranial (and intracranial) vessels and, occasionally, for progressing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> related to internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, both of which are relatively uncommon manifestations of cerebral vascular occlusive disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It may have application in the rare "slow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>." The procedure is probably of limited value, if any, in the management of large completed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> but may be indicated in selected patients with small infarctions who have preserved most of their cerebral function and who have had evidence of subsequent focal ischemic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The procedure is useful for bypassing giant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> or basofrontal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> invading major vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It may have a role in the management of fibromuscular disease of the internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
