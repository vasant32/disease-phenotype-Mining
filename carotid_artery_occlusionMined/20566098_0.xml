<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Summary: In many cases, the prognosis for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cervical carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> is poor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, a standard treatment for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage is not yet established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report here the results of eight consecutive patients (mean age 71.5 years old) in which revascularization mainly by suction thrombectomy was performed under proximal protection during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The occlusion sites were the intracranial internal carotid artery in five patients, tandem lesions of the internal carotid origin and intracranial vessel in two patients, and the common carotid artery in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, the subjects who received the treatment had an extent of infarction in MRI/DWI that was 1/3 or less of the internal carotid artery territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean time from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> to treatment commencement was 7.25 hours (2-28 hours) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For the endovascular treatment, a guiding catheter with a balloon was used for proximal protection of the carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Revascularization was performed mainly by suction thrombectomy, and if a stenosed lesion was observed, <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp>/stenting was added </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Local fibrinolysis was not performed in combination with the above procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The treatment results were complete recanalization in three patients and partial recanalization in three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, recanalization was not achieved in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No hyperfusion syndrome or hemorrhagic infarction was observed postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> four patients in whom <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> were successfully aspirated had occlusions proximal to the ophthalmic artery branch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In three of these four patients, complete recanalization was achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The revascularization procedure using suction thrombectomy under proximal protection was considered effective against the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cervical carotid occlusions, in particular, those proximal to the ophthalmic artery branch </plain></SENT>
