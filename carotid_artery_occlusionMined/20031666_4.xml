<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> cervical internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (ICAO) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> may benefit from revascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The feasibility of endovascular recanalization for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> ICAO has been reported recently, but its safety is still unproven </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report the follow-up results of 54 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> ICAO patients who underwent endovascular recanalization, focusing on potential vascular complications and corresponding management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Endovascular recanalization for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> ICAO was attempted in 54 consecutive patients (48 men; 69.2 + or - 9.8 years old) with either recurrent neurological deficit or objective ipsilateral hemisphere <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean duration from occlusion documentation to the procedure was 237 + or - 327 days (range, 56 to 1424 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Adverse events while in the hospital and during the 3-month follow-up were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Successful recanalization was achieved in 35 of 54 patients (65%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three-month cumulative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate was 4% (2 of 54), including 1 in-hospital fatal nonipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and 1 in-hospital minor ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> secondary to systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Vascular complications developed in 3 of 54 patients (6%), including 1 late pseudoaneurysm formation 3 months after recanalization, 1 immediate carotid-cavernous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> after recanalization, and 1 minor extravasation at carotid bifurcation after failed recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, no clinical sequela was noted with close follow-up and adequate management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Certain immediate or delayed vascular complications may develop during or after the endovascular recanalization for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> ICAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although periprocedural <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate is limited in our study, further study combining neuroimaging tools and cognitive function evaluation is mandatory to assess its utility and appropriateness in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> ICAO </plain></SENT>
