<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Changes in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="42471">forskolin</z:chebi> (FK) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17598">phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17598">PDBu</z:chebi>) binding were evaluated in relation to local cerebral blood flow (CBF) after 6-h unilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in the gerbil striatum employing a quantitative autoradiographic method, which permitted these three parameters to be measured in the same brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CBF was measured by the [<z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>]iodoantipyrine method at the end of the experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>[3H]FK and [3H]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17598">PDBu</z:chebi> were utilized as specific ligands to assess the activity of adenylate cyclase (AC) and protein kinase C (PKC), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A saturation study was undertaken to measure the Kd (dissociation constant) and Bmax (maximal binding capacity) of each ligand by digital image processing of sequential autoradiograms employing pixel-by-pixel Scatchard analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Bmax values of FK and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17598">PDBu</z:chebi> were significantly decreased on the ischemic side, but the reduction in Bmax of FK was greater than that of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17598">PDBu</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The K4 of each ligand remained unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The FK binding underwent a progressive decline as CBF fell below 30 ml/100 g/min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17598">PDBu</z:chebi> binding showed only a gradual decline in parallel with the CBF reduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that a reduction in CBF below 30 ml/100 g/min for 6 h may induce a remarkable suppression of the AC system with less significant inhibition of the PKC system in the striatum </plain></SENT>
