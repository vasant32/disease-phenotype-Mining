<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>ERG changes following <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> BCCAO have been well described, but the effects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> BCCAO on the histopathology of the retina remain to be characterized in a reproducible model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> BCCAO was induced in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi>-anaesthetized male Wistar rats and the retina fixed after 3, 6, or 24 hr, 1 week, and 2, 4, or 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cell counts and measurements of <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> layers were performed in H&amp;E stained paraffin sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry with a panel of fourteen antibodies served to examine the survival of different <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> cell class, astrocytic reactions and the expression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stress response proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A lectin method was used to label activated microglial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Microglial activation, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> oxygenase-1 upregulation and caspase-3 cleavage occurred during the first 24hr in the absence of overt cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> ganglion cells (RGC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three waves of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegeneration</z:hpo> followed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RGCs were affected after 1 week, followed by neurons in the inner nuclear layer at 2 months, and finally photoreceptors at 4 months </plain></SENT>
