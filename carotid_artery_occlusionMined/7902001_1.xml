<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Pressor responses to bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and systemic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8093">phenylephrine</z:chebi> (PE) infusion were not altered by training </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During occlusion, peak and steady-state changes in hindlimb vascular resistance (HLR) were significantly greater in trained (24 and 13%) than in sedentary (8 and -3%) rats; a similar trend existed for intestinal vascular resistance (IR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The pressure-dependent contribution was consistent between groups (HLR: peak 55-85%, steady state 25-45%; IR: peak and steady state 40-65%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During PE infusion, increases in IR and HLR were similar between groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The increase in HLR was substantially pressure dependent in both groups (approximately 50% at highest dose) as was the change in IR in trained rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the IR response to PE was not pressure dependent in sedentary rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The direct effects of PE were similar between sedentary and trained rats in the hindlimb but were suppressed in the intestine of trained rats compared with sedentary rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, aerobic exercise training altered adrenergic and pressure-dependent vasoregulatory mechanisms in both skeletal muscle and intestinal tissues </plain></SENT>
