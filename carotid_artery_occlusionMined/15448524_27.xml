<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study investigates the long-term effects of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> on neuronal damage and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-related proteins after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned as follows: group 1 (n = 32, control): fentanyl and nitrous <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi>-oxygen; group 2 (n = 32, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi>): <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> and oxygen-air </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Ischemia</z:e> (45 min) was induced by carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pericranial temperature and arterial blood gases were maintained constant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After 1, 3, 7, and 28 postischemic days, brains were removed, frozen, and sliced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hippocampal eosinophilic cells were counted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The amount of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-related proteins Bax, p53, Bcl-2, and Mdm-2 and neurons positive for activated caspase-3 were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi>-anesthetized rats, no eosinophilic neurons were detected, whereas in control animals, 16-54% of hippocampal neurons were eosinophilic (days 1-28) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In control animals, the concentration of Bax was 70-200% higher after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> compared with that in animals receiving <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Bcl-2 was 50% lower in control animals compared with <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi>-anesthetized rats during the first 3 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In both groups, a maximal 3% of the hippocampal neurons were positive for activated caspase-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data show sustained neuroprotection with <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This relates to reduced eosinophilic and apoptotic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Activated caspase-3-dependent apoptotic pathways were not affected by <z:chebi fb="3" ids="44915">propofol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This suggests the presence of activated caspase-3-independent apoptotic pathways </plain></SENT>
