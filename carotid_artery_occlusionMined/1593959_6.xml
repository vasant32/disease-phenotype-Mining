<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Tissues were obtained by bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Water, Na, and K contents were measured in ischemic brain tissue at the same time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Water and Na content increased while the TIS value and K content decreased following ischemic insults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The T1 value did not change until 180 min after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> had been induced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Changes in the TIS value occurred earlier than changes observed for the T1 value, water, and electrolyte contents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results indicate that the value of TIS may be useful for detecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and that the physical structure of water-macromolecular interaction may be altered soon after ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> in brain tissue </plain></SENT>
