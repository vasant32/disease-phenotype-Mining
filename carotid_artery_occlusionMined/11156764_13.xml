<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We generated regional cerebral blood volume (rCBV) and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) studies from dynamic susceptibility contrast-enhanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images after an intravenous bolus injection of contrast agent (perfusion-weighted imaging [PWI]) by applying indicator dilution theory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We used a multishot echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence to obtain adequate arterial input function (AIF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our purpose was to compare the cerebral hemodynamics measured by PWI with the rCBF values and cerebral perfusion reserve obtained by <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi>-133 single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission CT (133Xe-SPECT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eight patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> or stenosis were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PWI data were acquired using a multishot EPI sequence, and the AIF was determined automatically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our procedure was based on indicator dilution theory and deconvolution analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To eliminate the effect of superficial vessels, the automatic threshold selection method was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: AIF was adequate to generate rCBF and rCBV images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The rCBF and rCBV images by PWI were superior to 133Xe-SPECT scans in spatial resolution, and the rCBF values obtained by PWI correlated well with those obtained by 133Xe-SPECT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The regions with severely decreased perfusion reserve, which were determined by pre- and post-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> 133Xe-SPECT, showed significantly lower rCBF and higher rCBV by PWI than did regions with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and moderately decreased perfusion reserve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The rCBF and rCBV images generated by our procedure using PWI data appear to provide important clinical information for evaluating the degree of cerebral perfusion reserve impairment in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
