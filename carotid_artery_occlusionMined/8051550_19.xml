<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Moderate intraischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> attenuates <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> release and confers protection from ischemic damage, whereas mild intraischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>hyperthermia</z:hpo> increases <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> release and augments ischemic pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As protein kinase C (PKC) is implicated in neurotransmitter release and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> receptor-mediated events, we evaluated the relationship between intraischemic brain temperature and PKC activity in brain regions known to be vulnerable or nonvulnerable to transient global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cytosolic, membrane-bound, and total PKC activities were determined in hippocampal, striatal, cortical, and thalamic homogenates at the end of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and at 0.25-24 h of recirculation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PKC activity of control rats varied by region and were affected by altered brain temperature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For both membrane-bound and cytosolic PKC, there was a significant temperature effect, and for membrane-bound PKC there was also a significant effect of region </plain></SENT>
