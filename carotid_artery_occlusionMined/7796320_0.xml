<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study examines the effect of the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="35471">psychotropic drug</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51038">minaprine</z:chebi> on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairment</z:hpo> in Mongolian gerbils subjected to a 5-min bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, as assessed by their performance in an 8-arm radial maze task </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Gerbils were initially trained on the 8-arm radial maze until their mean error was 0-1 for 5 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This task was repeated before the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was performed and again 7 days after it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Then the animals were immediately sacrificed for histopathological examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairment</z:hpo> occurred in the control gerbils; whereas when <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51038">minaprine</z:chebi> 75 mg/kg was given orally 30 min before the 5-min occlusion, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairment</z:hpo> was significantly reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Histopathological analysis of the control gerbils showed nearly complete loss of the pyramidal neurons in the CA1 region of the hippocampus, whereas the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51038">minaprine</z:chebi>-treated gerbils showed complete preservation of the pyramidal neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51038">minaprine</z:chebi> has <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory-impairment</z:hpo>-prevention and neuroprotective effects against short-term <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in gerbils </plain></SENT>
