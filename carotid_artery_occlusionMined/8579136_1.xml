<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was performed to ascertain whether laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) could detect changes in blood flow within the tympanic segment of the rabbit facial nerve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Compression of the facial nerve immediately distal to the geniculate ganglion resulted in an 80-95 percent reduction in blood flow in the tympanic segment of the nerve, whereas distal neurovascular compression had no effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Blood flow in the tympanic segment of the nerve fell 40-60 percent during ipsilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, but no change occurred with contralateral carotid occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Signal-averaging techniques detected a sinusoidal amplitude modulation of the LDF flow signal that was synchronous with the cardiac cycle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The peak-to-peak amplitude of this modulation was reduced by proximal nerve compression, and the reduction in amplitude was in proportion to the overall reduction in the LDF flow signal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The authors conclude that the direction of blood flow in the tympanic segment of the rabbit facial nerve is primarily proximal to distal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> changes in blood flow within the tympanic segment of the nerve could readily be detected using LDF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This technique offers the possibility of monitoring human facial nerve blood flow, and may help elucidate the pathophysiology of various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015464" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">facial neuropathies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
