<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To compare the potential humaneness of three types of neck-hold killing traps in terms of the blood vessels that are occluded, and to examine the <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> of the blood vessels that supply blood to the possum's brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: The prevalence of occlusion of the common carotid arteries and the trachea was examined in 33 possums which were caught with Timms, <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> and Conibear 160 traps </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> of the blood supply to the brain was examined in six possums using a resin casting technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The prevalence of complete bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was 77% for the Timms trap, 45% for the <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> trap and 22% for the Conibear 160 trap </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The major route for blood supply to the brain was via the common carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Where the aim is to kill possums quickly by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> of the brain, the Timms trap is to be preferred over the <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> and Conibear 160 traps </plain></SENT>
