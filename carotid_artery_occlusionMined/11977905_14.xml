<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Vascular imaging, safety, and outcome of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> therapy for ICA occlusion is not well described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our goal was to determine the site of occlusion, early recanalization after <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> infusion, and its relationship to outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed our database of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients treated with i.v </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> between July 1997 and July 1999 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We identified <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases with carotid occlusion suggested by transcranial Doppler (TCD) and angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Occlusion and recanalization were assessed by site including proximal ICA (prICA), terminal ICA (tICA), and middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Baseline National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) scores and follow-up Rankin scores were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We treated 20 patients with carotid occlusion (age 63.9 +/- 10.8 years, 11 males, 9 females) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Time to <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> infusion after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> was 128 +/- 66 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Baseline NIHSS scores were 16.4 +/- 5.4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Time to follow-up was 3.5 +/- 4.9 months (2 patients were lost to follow-up) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Occlusion sites were prICA 40%, tICA 70%, and concurrent <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> 45% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Multiple sites were involved in 10/20 patients (50%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Among patients with pretreatment and posttreatment vascular imaging studies (n = 18), recanalization in the prICA and tICA was complete in 10%, partial in 16%, and none in 74% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> recanalization was complete in 35%, partial in 24%, and none in 41% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>At follow-up, Rankin 0-1 was found in 8 patients (44%), Rankin 2-3 in 3 (17%), and Rankin 4-5 in 3 (17%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Mortality was 22% (n = 4) including 1 fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Improvement was closely related to resumption of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> flow (P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Most patients did not recanalize their ICA occlusion after intravenous <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>However, recanalization of associated proximal <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> clot, found in 45% of our patients, or improved <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> collateral flow was strongly associated with good outcome </plain></SENT>
