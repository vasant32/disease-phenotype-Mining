<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using a newly developed NIRS apparatus, HEO-200, the authors continuously monitored the changes in the oxygenation state of brain <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> during carotid endarterectomy (CEA) or carotid balloon occlusion tests (BOT) in 21 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP), regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) or transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD) were also employed to compare with the NIRS-responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 7 of 21 patients, the carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> caused a continuous deoxygenation of brain <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> as well as a decrease in total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings correlated well with temporary neurological deficits and a marked reduction of rCBF in the ipsilateral hemisphere in patients who underwent carotid BOT under local anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patients also showed a marked decrease in the N20 amplitude of SEP during CEA under general anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Restoration of blood flow immediately resolved these findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The other 14 patients demonstrated no or only transient changes on NIRS as well as on SEP and rCBF study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>HEO-200 could non-invasively monitor the relative changes of cerebral oxygenation state with good time resolution, and detect critical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> during CEA and carotid BOT </plain></SENT>
