<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied 17 patients with ischemic cerebrovascular symptoms and unilateral CCAO on angiography to help clarify clinical and radiologic features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mean age was 62 years; 65% were women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Predominant symptoms and signs included visual-ipsilateral monocular or retrochiasmal symptoms (88%), motor <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> (88%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0152027" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sensory disturbance</z:e> (59%), dizziness/lightheadedness (53%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> (24%) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Positionally related symptoms occurred in approximately two-thirds of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> were often multiple and preceded a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or occurred without subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in 82% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Hemispheric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> contralateral to the CCAO occurred in 41% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ten patients (59%) suffered <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, seven (70%) of which were ipsilateral to the CCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Vascular risk factors included cigarette use (76%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (71%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> (41%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo> (41%); 82% had two or more risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Known <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> was present in 59% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CCAO was present at the origin of the vessel in most patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Most had atherosclerotic narrowing of multiple extracranial large vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>During follow-up, none of the patients had a spontaneous second <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>; five had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo>, including two with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100576'>amaurosis fugax</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> in the CCAO territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>More restricted external carotid collaterals may, in part, explain the higher frequency of ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and contralateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> than reported for internal carotid occlusion </plain></SENT>
