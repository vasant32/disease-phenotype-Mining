<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> within 3 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> who were treated with tPA were studied prospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with internal carotid artery, M1, and M2 occlusion were enrolled, and independent clinical and MRI factors associated with no early recanalization within 1 hour after tPA administration were examined using multivariate logistic regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred thirty-two patients (63 men; mean age, 76.4±10.2 years; internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in 37 patients, M1 occlusion in 58, and M2 occlusion in 37) were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Follow-up <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography within 60 minutes after tPA infusion revealed early recanalization in 49 (37.1%) patients (complete in 16 patients, partial in 33) and no recanalization in 83 (62.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using 8 variables (<z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, time from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> to treatment ≥140 minutes, use of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> ≥135 mg/dL, large artery diseases, internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, M1 occlusion, and M1 susceptibility vessel sign on T2*) identified on univariate analysis at P&lt;0.2, multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that M1 susceptibility vessel sign was the only independent factor associated with no early recanalization (OR, 7.157; 95% CI, 1.756 to 29.172; P=0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of M1 susceptibility vessel sign for predicting no early recanalization were 31.3%, 93.9%, 89.7%, and 44.7%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Of clinical and MRI factors before tPA infusion, M1 susceptibility vessel sign on T* is the only independent factor associated with no early recanalization within 1 hour after tPA administration </plain></SENT>
