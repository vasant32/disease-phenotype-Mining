<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is the gold-standard procedure for the majority of patients with high-grade symptomatic internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> and also for specified high-grade asymptomatic stenoses; however, a proportion of patients are treated with carotid endovascular therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We aimed to document medium-term clinical and neurosonographical outcome after carotid artery stenting (CAS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 53 patients (mean age: 65 +/- 8 years) with high-grade (&gt; or = 70 % by means of duplex sonography) carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> were enrolled into the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nineteen patients had asymptomatic, 34 patients had symptomatic stenoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had a pre-interventional CT, Doppler and duplex sonography, and digital subtraction angiography (DSA) or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) prior to the procedural DSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were offered CEA as the gold-standard procedure and as an alternative to CAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both clinical and Duplex sonographical follow-up was obtained at day 1 and 7, month 1, month 3, month 6, month 12, and every subsequent 6 months after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up time was 22 +/- 1.6 months (+/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 2/53 patients suffered from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A further 2 patients suffered from carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> shortly after CAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The cumulative rate of restenosis during follow-up was 24.5 % (13/53) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Four of these (7.5 %) were of high-grade and led to further interventional or surgical therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A high rate of restenosis was found during follow-up after CAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our analysis of non-selected patients emphasizes that CEA remains the gold-standard procedure for the treatment of symptomatic internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The frequently performed endovascular treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> outside the setting of a randomized controlled trial is not supported by our data </plain></SENT>
