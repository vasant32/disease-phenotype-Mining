<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus we examined in immature and juvenile rats the relationship between hypoxic-ischemic changes in T1 and T2 and the alterations in brain water content, as assessed by differences in tissue wet-dry weights </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One- and 4-wk-old rats were anesthetized and subjected to unilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and subsequent exposure to <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> (8% oxygen) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>T1 and T2 maps were acquired at 9.4 T, and then brain water content was measured in sham controls or in hypoxic-ischemic animals before, during, and 1 or 24 h after <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In sham controls, T1, T2, and proton density decreased with increasing age, corresponding to an ontogenic decrease in water content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 1-wk-old rats, increases in T1 and T2 were observed during and at 1 and 24 h after <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, corresponding to elevations in water content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 4-wk-old rats, T1 and water content increased during and at 1 and 24 h after <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> whereas T2 was not increased until 24 h after <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Regression analysis showed that T1 correlated better with total water content than T2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In both immature and older brain, an increase in total brain water develops acutely and persists after an episode of cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, and T1 imaging detects this change better than T2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Hypoxic-ischemic changes in T2 are age dependent, reflecting other physicochemical changes of water in the tissue than water content alone </plain></SENT>
