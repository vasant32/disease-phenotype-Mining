<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography was used to evaluate mean middle cerebral artery blood velocity and blood flow in major collateral arteries in 78 patients, including 39 patients with 40 internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusions</z:mp> and 39 control patients with less severe extracranial cerebrovascular disease, matched for age and sex distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Middle cerebral artery blood velocity was 38.9 +/- 17.9 cm/sec ipsilateral to an occlusion, 50.9 +/- 18.3 cm/sec contralateral to an occlusion (p less than 0.01), and 56.8 +/- 14.4 cm/sec in the controls (p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pulsatility index ipsilateral to an occlusion (0.86 +/- 0.32) was reduced compared with contralateral and control pulsatility indexes (1.05 +/- 0.33 and 1.03 +/- 0.18) respectively; p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Major intracerebral collateral arteries were detectable in 94.9% of occlusion patients and in 53.8% of controls (p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A posterior communicating artery was demonstrated ipsilateral to an occlusion in 80.0% of the patients and contralateral to an occlusion in 39.5% (p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An ipsilateral posterior communicating artery was identified in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 10 asymptomatic occlusions and in 75.8% of the symptomatic ones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pulsatility index was 1.02 +/- 0.34 for asymptomatic occlusions and 0.76 +/- 0.30 for symptomatic occlusions (p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography permits noninvasive quantification of the cerebral hemodynamic consequences of internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and direct evaluation of the collateral blood supply, which can be correlated with symptomatology </plain></SENT>
