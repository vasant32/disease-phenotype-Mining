<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In order to obtain a more comprehensive intraoperative hemodynamic profile and to predict hypoperfusion during carotid endarterectomy, stump pressure, stump pulse, and retrograde internal carotid flow were measured in 261 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our results show a significant correlation between stump pressure and retrograde flow (p &lt; 0.001), stump pressure and the presence of a stump pulse (p &lt; 0.001), and retrograde flow and the presence of a stump pulse (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also demonstrated a significant correlation between stump pressure (lower), retrograde flow (less), and the absence of a stump pulse in patients with contralateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between the indication for carotid endarterectomy and any hemodynamic measurement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The triad of stump pulse, stump pressure, and retrograde flow accurately reflects collateral blood flow when the carotid is cross-clamped </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These determinations can be obtained at low cost and are easily and rapidly performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A protocol for selective shunting in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy with general anesthesia is suggested </plain></SENT>
