<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The contribution of the circle of Willis and cerebral cortical anastomoses to the maintenance of adequate blood supply into the involved hemisphere was analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It was concluded that the cerebral perfusion image is superior to angiography in evaluating collateral circulation, and in the case of carotid occlusion, the circle of Willis is important in preventing infarction in the territory of the perforating arteries, while the cerebral cortex mainly receives its blood supply through the cortical leptomeningeal anastomoses, illustrating the major role of the leptomeningeal anastomosis as a collateral channel </plain></SENT>
