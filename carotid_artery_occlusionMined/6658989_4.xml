<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The present study was designed to clarify the relationship of cerebral blood flow (CBF) to blood-brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) in the ischemic brains with or without recirculation, which were produced by clipping of both common carotid arteries in spontaneously hypertensive rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CBF was measured by the hydrogen clearance method and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> function was evaluated by the permeability of 131I-albumin and Evans blue dye </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cortical CBF was reduced from 48.8 +/- 9.5 to 4.0 +/- 1.2 ml/100 gm/min during 1 hr <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and further to 2.6 +/- 0.3 ml/100 gm/min during 3 hrs <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, while thalamic CBF was reduced much less from 50.0 +/- 3.6 to 17.9 +/- 6.5 ml/100 gm/min and to 17.5 +/- 11.0 ml/100 gm/min, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was no increase in permeability to protein tracers observed in such 1 hr or 3 hrs ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both cortical and thalamic CBF were markedly increased 2.5 to 6 fold of resting values at 5 min after recirculation in the 1 hr ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the 3 hrs ischemic brain, however, both CBF were only slightly increased but never restored to the resting level even at 30 min after recirculation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In such reperfused brains, exudation to Evans blue dye was observed in none of 16 animals with 1 hr <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, but in 18 of 23 with 3 hrs <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Disruption of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> was twice more frequent in the cortex (77.8%) than in either thalamus (33.3%) or hippocampus (33.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Permeability index of 131I-albumin (brain albumin/blood albumin) was significantly higher in the ischemic areas stained with blue dye (2.07 +/- 0.45%) than in non-ischemic control brain (0.10 +/- 0.01%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
