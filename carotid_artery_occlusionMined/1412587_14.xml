<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The basilar artery dilates in response to increases in blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The goal of this study was to examine effects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> on "flow-mediated" and endothelium-dependent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of the basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>Diabetes</z:mp> was induced in rats with 50 mg/kg <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Six months later, vessel diameter and velocity of blood flow through the basilar artery were measured using a cranial window in anesthetized rats under baseline conditions and during occlusion of the carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Changes in vessel diameter were also measured during topical application of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29321">sodium nitroprusside</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: With aortic pressure maintained at baseline levels, blood flow velocity through the basilar artery increased similarly in control and diabetic rats during unilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and during bilateral occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In control and diabetic rats, diameter of the basilar artery increased by 10 +/- 2% and 10 +/- 4% during unilateral occlusion and by 27 +/- 5% and 31 +/- 4% during bilateral occlusion, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> did not impair flow-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of the basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> in response to 10(-5) M topical <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> was less in diabetic rats (13 +/- 2%) than in control rats (45 +/- 8%) (p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Dilator responses to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7596">nitroprusside</z:chebi> were not impaired by <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> produces impairment of endothelium-dependent responses to <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi>, but not flow-mediated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath>, in the basilar artery </plain></SENT>
