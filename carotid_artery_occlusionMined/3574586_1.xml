<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> for 5 or 15 min with 1 hour of reestablished blood flow in gerbils served as a model for the respective studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An alteration in kinetic characteristics of S2-receptor binding sites labeled with [3H]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6123">ketanserin</z:chebi> (the potent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> for postsynaptic receptors) was detected in the synaptosomes separated from brains of gerbils subjected to 1 hour release after 15 but not following 5 min of bilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At the same time, an increased turnover rate of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi> was found in the cerebro-cortical homogenate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The duration of ischemic insult which leads to the changes in the properties of S2-binding sites and the increase in turnover rate of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi> has been identical with that needed for the marked accumulation of water in the gerbil brain reported previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, these findings are consistent with the implicated involvement of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi> in the formation of ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>cerebral edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
