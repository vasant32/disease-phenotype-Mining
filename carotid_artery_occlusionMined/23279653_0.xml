<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: High-grade cervical <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> (70-99%) or occlusion often accompanies reversed ophthalmic artery flow (ROAF), but its potential clinical significances remain poor understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study assessed ROAF and the related variables caused by carotid hemodynamic compromise in patients with unilateral severe cervical <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study consisted of 200 patients diagnosed as unilateral high-grade cervical <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo>/occlusion using ultrasonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The hemodynamic parameters of 152 patients, excluding 48 with cervical carotid occlusion, were compared based on the presence of ROAF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Out of 200 patients, 159 underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging and were analysed for risk factors impacting functional outcomes including ROAF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The patients (n = 48) with internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> had significantly higher incidence (62.5%) of ROAF compared with that of 25.0% in those patients (n = 152) with unilateral high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In ROAF patients (n = 38) with the unilateral high-grade stenosis, a significant retrobulbar arteries hemodynamic difference was observed between the stenotic and non-stenotic vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patients (n = 159) with history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (P = 0.035), ROAF (P = 0.023) and intracranial stenosis (P &lt; 0.001) exhibited significantly higher incidence of poor functional outcome compared with the corresponding control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the same patients (n = 159), those with both cervical and intracranial stenosis showed sevenfold higher risk (OR, 7.60; 95% CI, 3.44-16.81) for ROAF than those with only cervical stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: ROAF may result from intracranial hemodynamic compromise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with unilateral high-grade cervical <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo>/occlusion in combination with intracranial stenosis appear to be a significant risk factor for poor functional outcome and increased incidence of ROAF </plain></SENT>
