<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Pressor responses were brought about in the anesthetized group by bilateral, high intensity stimulation of the sciatic nerves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In these animals, bilateral section of the dorsolateral sulcus area (DLS) in the lumbar spinal cord completely eliminated both blood pressure and heart rate responses to this stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Baroreceptor-mediated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> induced by pressor doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8093">phenylephrine</z:chebi> was attenuated by sciatic nerve stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Obliteration of this baroreceptor-somatic afferent interaction required ventrolateral extension of the bilateral spinal lesions to include both the DLS and the dorsolateral funiculus (DLF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Blood pressure and heart rate increments in unanesthetized dogs were induced by treadmill running </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The pressor response to exercise was markedly increased by transient hind limb <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> during the course of the run </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Surgical interruption of the ascending limb of the somato-autonomic reflex in the spinal cord of these animals (L1-L2 combined DLS and DLF lesion) significantly reduced the blood pressure response to simultaneous exercise-occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These spinal lesions also reduced the heart rate response to treadmill running without occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The descending pathways involved in autonomic reflexes appeared intact as the spinal lesions did not alter the blood pressure or heart rate response to bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
