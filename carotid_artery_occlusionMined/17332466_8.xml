<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Recent studies have reported sex differences in recanalization and outcome after intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed sex differences in outcome in consecutive patients with middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) M1 or M2 and internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion treated with intra-arterial thrombolysis (IAT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recanalization immediately after thrombolysis and outcome after 3 months were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two hundred five patients (111 men) with <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> and 43 (22 men) with ICA occlusion were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Baseline variables did not differ between the sexes except for a higher prevalence of smokers among men in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> group (31% vs 12%; P=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Partial or complete recanalization (TIMI flow 2 or 3) of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> was observed in 71 (75%) women and 80 (72%) men (P=0.488) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the ICA group, 14 (67%) women and 11 men (50%) showed TIMI 2 or 3 recanalization (P=0.425) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Favorable outcome (modified Rankin Scale score 0 to 2) was seen in 57 women (61%) and 63 men (57%) with <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion (P=0.512) and in 6 women (28%) and 4 men (18%) with ICA occlusion (P=0.656) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After multiple-regression analyses, there was still no association between sex and outcome (P=0.763 for <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> and P=0.813 for ICA occlusion) or recanalization (P=0.488 for <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> and P=0.104 for ICA occlusion) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: There was no association between sex and recanalization or outcome after IAT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings are in contrast to previous studies reporting better recanalization and outcome after IVT in women and might have implications in the selection of patients for IAT or IVT </plain></SENT>
