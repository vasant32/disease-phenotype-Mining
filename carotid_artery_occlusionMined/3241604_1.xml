<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Groups of 3-week- and 3-month-old gerbils were subjected to 5 or 15 min of bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> alone or with 1 hr of release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Ischemia</z:e> of 5 and 15 min depleted energy-related metabolites but did not affect the content of either <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> or homovanillic acid in young and adult gerbils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At 1 h of reflow, after 5 and 15 min of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, the levels of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> significantly decreased, while those of homovanillic acid increased in the adult but not in the young gerbils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At this time a complete recovery of energy reserves was seen in both the young and the adult gerbils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that the ischemic change in homeostasis of energy metabolism is not directly associated with that of the noradrenergic system in young and adult cerebral cortex </plain></SENT>
