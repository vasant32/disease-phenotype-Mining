<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To compare the features of brain injury in neonatal rats with different severities of <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (HI), and explore the role of microglial activation and cytokines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred and twenty 7-day-old rats were randomized to three groups: sham control, mild HI, and severe HI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The rats in the HI groups were subjected to right carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and 8% oxygen <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> exposure (40 minutes, 34.5 Celsius degree in the mild HI group; 65 minutes, 35.5 Celsius degree in the severe HI group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MRI, microtubule associated protein (MAP2) and TUNEL staining were used to confirm the severity of brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Changes in expression of activated microglia (ED1) and signs of cytokine involvement or <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> (TNF-alpha, nitrotyrosine) were assessed immunohistochemically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the mild HI group, MRI scans demonstrated increased T2 values in the ipsilateral subcortical white matter and a slight loss of T2 values in the cortex, corresponding to a medium loss of MAP2 in the ipsilateral cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was an increase in the number of TUNEL positive cells compared to the control group within the subcortical white matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the severe HI group, the T2 value increased in the majority of the hemisphere, corresponding to a severe loss of staining for MAP2 in the ispilateral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The number of TUNEL positive cells significantly increased in the ipsilateral cortex and white matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the mild HI group, ED1, TNF-alpha and nitrotyrosine expression increased only in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage and was only observed in subcortical white matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast, after severe HI, the increase in ED1, TNF-alpha and nitrotyrosine expression was observed in the whole ipsilateral hemisphere and prolonged for weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Following a mild HI a relatively selective white matter injury compares to the pannecrosis in the cortex and white matter following a severe HI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Microglial activation and over-expression of cytokines might contribute to the development of hypoxic-ischemic brain damage </plain></SENT>
