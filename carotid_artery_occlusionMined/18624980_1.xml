<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the antithrombotic and profibrinolytic effects of tiplaxtinin (PAI-039), an orally bioavailable <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> of PAI-1, in rat models of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS AND RESULTS: Carotid artery and vena cava vascular injury was produced by application of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30808">FeCl3</z:chebi> and blood flow was monitored using ultrasonic technology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To assess efficacy in a <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> prevention paradigm, PAI-039 was administered orally 90 min before injury (1-30 mg kg(-1)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To assess efficacy in a <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> treatment paradigm, vascular injury and stable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation were followed 4 h later by recovery and PAI-039 administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PAI-039 prevented carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in 20, 68 and 60% of animals pretreated with 0.3, 1.0 and 3.0 mg kg(-1), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Time to occlusive <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was increased from 18.2 +/- 4.6 min in controls to 32.5 +/- 8.7 (P = ns), 46.1 +/- 7.0 (P &lt; 0.05), and 41.6 +/- 11.3 min (P &lt; 0.05) in the respective PAI-039 treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the vena cava protocol, PAI-039 pretreatment significantly reduced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> weight at PAI-039 doses of 3, 10 and 30 mg kg(-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When PAI-039 was dosed in a treatment paradigm 4 h after stable arterial and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo>, a significant reduction in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> weight was observed 24 h later at PAI-039 doses of 3, 10 and 30 mg kg(-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>PAI-039 (10, 30 and 100 mg kg(-1)) had no effect on platelet aggregation in response to <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi> or collagen and was not associated with increased <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0008151'>prolonged prothrombin time</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In animals bearing no vascular injury, PAI-039 had no effect on circulating, low-levels of PAI-1 activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast, circulating PAI-1 activity increased 5-fold following the induction of vascular injury, which was completely neutralized by PAI-039 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: PAI-039 exerts antithrombotic efficacy in rat models of arterial and venous vascular injury without effecting platelet aggregation </plain></SENT>
