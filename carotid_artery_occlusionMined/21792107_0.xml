<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There is a theoretical concern that a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> may be dislodged distally when crossing the occluded segment during recanalization of a complete occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the immediate postprocedural brain diffusion-weighted image (DWI) findings following endovascular recanalization using an embolic protection device for proximal internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively identified 12 patients who underwent stent implantation for sudden symptomatic occlusion of the proximal ICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 8 patients, no additional intracranial occlusions were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 4 patients, an additional intracerebral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> was detected in the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Distal protection devices were used in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the presence and amount of retrieved embolic fragments in the distal protection devices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The incidence and location of postprocedural emboli were determined using DWI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Recanalization of the proximal ICA was achieved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After complete occlusion of the proximal ICA was demonstrated, primary passage of the embolic protection device through the occluded ICA was gently navigated in 7 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, this was not possible in 5 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Three patients developed new lesions on postprocedural DWI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Of the 12 patients in which distal protection devices were used, debris was detected in 7 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In endovascular revascularization of proximal ICA occlusion, postprocedural emboli occur less frequently than reported in a systematic review of the DWI literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The real risk of dislodging <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> appears to be from plaque fragment mobilization by angioplasty, rather than from crossing an occluded segment </plain></SENT>
