<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Age is the most important risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent experiments evidenced an age-associated rarefaction of the native collateral vasculature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to assess in what way age and arteriogenesis influence cortical perfusion and recovery of hemodynamic impairment in aged and young C57/BL6 mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: After model establishment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1695782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral hypoperfusion</z:e> in the C57/BL6 strain, sustained hemodynamic impairment was induced by permanent unilateral internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in animals aged 4 to 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 18 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Functional and morphological outcome was assessed by laser speckle imaging before and during <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> challenge on Days 0, 3, 7, and 14 and latex/carbon black angiography and immunohistochemistry on Day 21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Although internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> did not result in a reduction of baseline perfusion, it led to significant hemodynamic impairment in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> age groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, baseline perfusion in sham and cerebrovascular reactivity after internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> were significantly lower in animals aged 18 months (468±57 Flux; 20.8%±17%) compared with mice aged 4 to 6 weeks (568±120 Flux; 30.3%±17%) and 12 weeks (591±72 Flux; 34.2%±12%) from the beginning until Day 7 of the monitoring period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Functional outcome was in line with a 27% reduction of native leptomeningeal anastomoses in aged mice and only limited collateral outgrowth compared with young animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Strikingly, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> age groups reached spontaneous functional compensation by Day 14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Next to limited collateral remodeling, our results suggest that a hampered cerebrovascular response with age could intensify the risk for hemodynamic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the elderly </plain></SENT>
