<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cyclic flow reduction (CFR) developed in the carotid artery in seven of nine dogs on day 5.1 +/- 0.8 (mean +/- S.E.M.) at a frequency of 6.7 +/- 0.6 cycles per 30 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This phenomenon was abolished for 30 +/- 5 and 45 +/- 15 min with intravenous administration of 50 and 100 micrograms/kg, respectively of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26995">thromboxane</z:chebi> receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, BM 13.505, 4-[2-(4-chloro-<z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35358">sulfonamide</z:chebi>)-ethyl]-<z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="22" ids="15366">acetic acid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Total carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> occurred on day 7.9 +/- 0.8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CFR developed in the femoral artery in one of three dogs on day 4 at a frequency of 7 cycles per 30 min and was abolished for 82 min after BM 13.505 (50 micrograms/kg i.v.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The vessel became totally occluded on day 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, CFR developed in the left anterior descending coronary artery in three of five dogs on day 9.3 +/- 4.9 at a frequency of 6.2 +/- 0.9 cycles per 30 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CFR was abolished for 37 min after BM 13.505 (50 micrograms/kg i.v.) and for several hours after an oral dose of aspirin (650 mg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Total <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151814" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary occlusion</z:e> was observed on day 17.4 +/- 2.6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The present results demonstrate that CFR can be induced in various arteries in conscious, chronically instrumented dogs by <z:hpo ids='HP_0003677'>slowly progressive</z:hpo> narrowing via Ameroid constrictors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This phenomenon may serve as a model for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1456822" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">claudication</z:e>, and unstable <z:mp ids='MP_0006112'>angina</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Because the conscious state is maintained, drug interactions with <z:chebi fb="37" ids="38867">anesthetics</z:chebi> are avoided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The usefulness of inhibitors of platelet aggregation in this model documents the potential benefit of such compounds in various vascular <z:mp ids='MP_0002054'>disease states</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
