<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus, the extracellular release of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22651">ascorbate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> was measured during the early stage of forebrain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion in the rat hippocampus using a microdialysis biosensor system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Male Wistar rats were anesthetized with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi> under mechanical ventilation and normothermia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two probes of the microdialysis biosensor electrode were inserted in the hippocampus bilaterally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One probe was perfused with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and the oxidation signal of dialyzed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22651">ascorbate</z:chebi> was recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A second electropolymerized probe was perfused with PBS containing <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> oxidase for <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> measurement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Forebrain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion was performed by bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> with hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> (MAP=30 mmHg) for 10 min (Group 10, n=10) or 15 min (Group 15, n=10), followed by reperfusion for 60 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The release of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> increased significantly to 294% (Group 10) and 334% (Group 15) during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, and then decreased rapidly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In Group 15, however, it remained significantly higher after reperfusion than in Group 10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The release of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22651">ascorbate</z:chebi> increased significantly to 504% (Group 10) and 334% (Group 15) after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In Group 10, it was significantly higher for 5-15 min after reperfusion than in Group 15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The marked increase of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22651">ascorbate</z:chebi> during reperfusion was associated with the rapid decrease in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The extended time of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> significantly inhibited <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> re-uptake and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22651">ascorbate</z:chebi> release during reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest the extracellular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22651">ascorbate</z:chebi> release during reperfusion after global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> as a marker of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> re-uptake </plain></SENT>
