<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to investigate the reliability of these parameters in assessing the hemodynamic disturbance of carotid occlusive disease in comparison with normative data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Dynamic contrast-enhanced T2*-weighted perfusion <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging was performed in 19 patients with symptomatic unilateral internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and 20 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The three parameters were calculated from the concentration-time curve fitted by gamma-variate function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lesion-to-contralateral ratios of each parameter were compared between patients and control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean +/- SD of rrCBV, rMTT and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> ratios of patients were 1.089 +/- 0.118, 1.054 +/- 0.031 and 1.062 +/- 0.039, respectively, and those of control subjects were 1.002 +/- 0.045, 1.000 +/- 0.006, 1.001 +/- 0.006, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The rMTT and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> ratios of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were greater than 2 SDs of control data, whereas in only 6 patients (32%), rrCBV ratios were greater than 2 SDs of control data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The three parameter ratios of the patients were significantly high compared with those of control subjects, respectively (p &lt; 0.01 for rrCBV ratios, p &lt; 0.0001 for rMTT ratios, and p &lt; 0.0001 for <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> ratios) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that rMTT and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> of patients, in contrast to rrCBV, are distributed in narrow ranges minimally overlapped with control data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The rMTT and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> could be more reliable parameters than rrCBV in assessing the hemodynamic disturbance in carotid occlusive disease </plain></SENT>
