<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The blood pressure monitored from the cannulated right carotid artery and heart rate responses to occlusion of the intact left carotid artery were investigated in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hexamethonium abolished the response to ganglion stimulants but not that to carotid occlusion, although the time course and nature of the response were altered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The pressor response to carotid occlusion in the presence of hexamethonium was not abolished by carotid sinus denervation, vagal section, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9774">tubocurarine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="28" ids="16684">atropine</z:chebi>, ethyl alcohol or an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, but it was abolished by high doses of phenoxybenzamine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In six out of eight experiments the response was not abolished by cervical cord section </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It was concluded that the pressor response to carotid occlusion in the presence of hexamethonium in the rat involves an adrenergic mechanism which is at least in part independent of the autonomic ganglia, and which is mediated by an agent liberated from the brain, possibly under conditions of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
