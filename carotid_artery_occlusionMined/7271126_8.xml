<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the analysis complications were grouped as <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo>; <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> or monoplegia; and transitory cerebral symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Primary independent variables included method of occlusion (abrupt, gradual); duration of occlusion; and collateral circulation via the external carotid artery (intact, ligated external carotid artery) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>Death</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> occurred in 24 cases (15.4%) and complications including <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> or monoplegia occurred in 47 cases (30.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although no statistically significant difference between abrupt and gradual occlusion cases was noted, the incidence of cerebral complications was significantly lower for the group with gradual carotid occlusions performed over 13 days (6.3%) than for those with abrupt occlusions or gradual occlusions performed in less than five days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> following carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was 10.5% in cases with an intact external carotid artery, as against 25.5% in those with a ligated external carotid artery, a statistically significant difference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cerebral complications occurred within 48 hours after carotid occlusion in 35 of 47 cases (74.5%) in which complications developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the remaining 12 cases (25.5%) complications developed after 48 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no difference between abrupt and gradual occlusion cases in the incidence of complications after 48 hours </plain></SENT>
