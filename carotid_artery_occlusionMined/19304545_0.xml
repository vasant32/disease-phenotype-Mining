<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-four healthy male gerbils were randomized into 3 equal groups, namely the sham-operated group with isolation of the bilateral carotid arteries but without occlusion, IR injury model group with bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, and <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> cromoglycate treatment group with bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> cromoglycate administration at 25 mg/kg via the lingual vein as soon as the reperfusion start with another dose 1 h later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The animals were then sacrificed and the thalamus were removed, fixed in 10% <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16842">formaldehyde</z:chebi> and sliced for observation under light microscope with HE staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The rest brain tissues were prepared into homogenate to determine the content of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The right hemispheres of the gerbils were measured for wet weight and dry weight to calculate the water content in the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The water content in the brain of the gerbils in the model group was the highest among the groups, and that in <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> cromoglycate treatment group was significantly less than that of the model group (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Microscopic examination showed the most severe brain tissue damage in the model group with also the highest TNF-alpha and IL-1beta levels in the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The brain TNF-alpha and IL-1beta levels in <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> cromoglycate group were significantly decreased as compared with those in the model group (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">Sodium</z:chebi> cromoglycate can alleviate brain IR injury possibly by lowering the TNF-alpha and IL-1beta levels in the brain tissues </plain></SENT>
