<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both processes seem to be governed by <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-induced growth factors, of which vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a prominent example </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of VEGF overexpression (V1 mice) on mice cognitive function and cerebral structure under moderate cerebral oligemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 33 V1 and <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (wt) mice, the left common carotid artery was permanently occluded (CCAO) under <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> (48 h) and subchronic (12 days) conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sham operation was performed in 35 mice (controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Psychometric testing was done using holeboard test and <z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris Water Maze</z:mp> system, immunohistochemistry was performed for detection of cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, nestin and CD31 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results show that under control conditions V1 mice showed better spatial cognitive abilities as compared to their wt littermates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During CCAO, time and distance to reach a hidden platform in Water Maze were shorter in V1 mice as compared to wt animals, indicative of faster learning and better spatial memory processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>While no signs of <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> were detected, immunohistochemistry showed that VEGF transgenity was related to higher number of nestin-positive precursor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Finally, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> CCAO was paralleled by a reduction of CD31 staining in wt but not V1 mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that VEGF overexpression led to a protective effect on cognitive function, because V1 mice showed evidence for faster spatial learning and better memory, as well as an <z:mp ids='MP_0004980'>increased number of neuronal precursor cells</z:mp> and a prevention of endothelial cell loss after CCAO </plain></SENT>
