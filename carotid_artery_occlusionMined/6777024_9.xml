<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The pathogenesis of ischaemic neuronal damage along the arterial boundary zones of the forebrain was investigated in 20 lightly anaesthetized, spontaneously breathing baboons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A combination of bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An arterial <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37370">PO2</z:chebi> of 21.2 +/- 2.5 mmHg was maintained for about 20 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additional occlusion of the left common carotid artery for 20 min had no effect on the EEG (except for one animal with a cerebrovascular anomaly) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only when occlusion of the right carotid artery was added did the EEG become almost or completely isoelectric after an interval ranging from 23 s to 44 min (sequential common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> while breathing air did not affect the EEG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After a chosen period of electrical silence, <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> and carotid occlusion were terminated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>Hypotension</z:hpo> did not occur during carotid occlusion or the recovery period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Survival was deliberately limited to 46 h, during which neurological assessment was made and the EEG was recorded just before in vivo perfusion-fixation of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neurological deficits included asymmetrical <z:hpo ids='HP_0002273'>quadriparesis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001336'>myoclonus</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The brains of 3 animals were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and in the 15 with brain damage this was restricted in the cerebral cortex to the arterial boundary zones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the presence of profound <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> the oligaemia due to bilateral carotid occlusion can reduce tissue oxygenation locally to a level critical for the production of ischaemic damage in the cortical boundary zones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Portions of the basal ganglia were also involved in 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The quantified brain damage scores correlated with the EEG scored on a six-point scale during the perod of electrical silence and early recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Brain damage scores also correlated with the times for intracranial pressure to return to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels from the peaks recorded just after the end of <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>As brain damage only occurred when the EEG during bilateral carotid occlusion and <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> was silent for at least 8 min, it was concluded that in a variety of clinical settings a simple EEG-based monitoring system would be optimal for the detection of an impending failure of cerebral oxygen supply </plain></SENT>
