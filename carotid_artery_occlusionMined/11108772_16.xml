<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A reproducible and quantitative model that minimizes the number of animals necessary to detect differences between treatment groups is therefore crucial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eight male baboons (weight, 22+/-2 kg) underwent left transorbital craniectomy followed by 1 hour of temporary ipsilateral internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> at the level of the anterior choroidal artery together with bilateral temporary occlusion of both anterior cerebral arteries (A1) proximal to the anterior communicating artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A tightly controlled nitrous <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi>-narcotic <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anesthetic</z:chebi> allowed for intraoperative motor evoked potential confirmation of middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) territory <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Animals survived to 72 hours or 10 days if successfully self-caring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Outcomes were assessed with a 100-point neurological grading system, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was quantified by planimetric analysis of both MRI and triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi>-stained sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Infarction volumes (on T2-weighted images) were 32+/-7% (mean+/-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) of the ipsilateral hemisphere, and neurological scores averaged 29+/-9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> animals demonstrated evidence of hemispheric infarction, with damage evident in both cortical and subcortical regions in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> vascular territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Histologically determined infarction volumes differed by &lt;3% and correlated with absolute neurological scores (r=0.9, P:=0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Transorbital temporary occlusion of the entire anterior cerebral circulation with strict control of physiological parameters can reliably produce reperfused <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The magnitude of the resultant <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> with little interanimal variability diminishes the potential number of animals required to distinguish between 2 treatment regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The anatomic distribution of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> and associated functional deficits offer comparability to human hemispheric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
