<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the use of an echo-enhancing agent in patients with carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> to improve the sensitivity and specificity of carotid color flow ultrasonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Between January 1997 and December 1998, a prospective study involving 85 cases of carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in 84 patients was carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After a baseline duplex ultrasonography (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DU</z:e>) diagnosis, a second (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DU</z:e>) along with an echo-enhancement agent (SHU-508-A [Levovist]) study was carried out (echo enhancement ultrasonography diagnosis [DUEE]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 82 cases, a contrast angiography was performed to confirm the diagnosis, whereas in the other three cases the diagnoses were confirmed with surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From the 85 internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusions</z:mp> diagnosed at the initial <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">DU</z:e> examination, seven came out to be false occlusions in the DUEE examination (8,2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a 100% correlation of the cases between the DUEE examination and the contrast angiography in the 82 cases in which this had been done </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In three of the cases, the diagnosis was confirmed surgically because these displayed severe stenoses according to the DUEE studies in symptomatic patients, and so they required urgent treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The DUEE study is a potent diagnosis tool that allows the differentiation between true carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusions</z:mp> and pseudo-occlusions </plain></SENT>
