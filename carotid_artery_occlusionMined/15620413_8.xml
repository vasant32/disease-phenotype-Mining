<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, we reported that level of orexin A in spinal fluid was decreased in the patients of some <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegenerative diseases</z:hpo> and it is considered that orexin A and the receptors might be related to central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the expression and localization of orexin receptors is not elicited well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the purpose of this study is to investigate the time-dependent changes and the cellular localization of orexin receptor focusing on orexin-1 receptor (OX1R) in the mouse brain after transient common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (tCCAO) model by using immunohistochemical techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>OX1R immunoreactivity dramatically increased and peaked in the hippocampus and cortex 2 days after tCCAO, but remained unchanged in the hypothalamus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using double-immunohistochemistry, the OX1R immunopositive cells at 2 days after tCCAO were co-localized not only with neuronal marker, NeuN-immunoreactivity but also with astroglial and oligodendroglial markers, GFAP- and CNPase-immunoreactivities, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggested that OX1R is induced other cells in addition to the neurons during stress such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and orexins and its receptor might play an important role for ischemic insult </plain></SENT>
