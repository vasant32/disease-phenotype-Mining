<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study was undertaken to test whether transient depolarizations occurring in periinfarct regions are important in contributing to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> spread and maturation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Following middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion we stimulated the ischemic penumbra with recurrent waves of spreading <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> (SD) and correlated the histopathological changes with the electrophysiological recordings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">Halothane</z:chebi>-anesthetized, artificially ventilated Sprague-Dawley rats underwent repetitive stimulation of SD in intact brain (Group 1; n = 8) or photothrombotic <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion coupled with ipsilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (Groups 2 and 3, n = 9 each) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The electroencephalogram and direct current (DC) potential were recorded for 3 h in the parietal cortex, which represented the periinffarct border zone in ischemic rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In Group 2, only spontaneously occurring negative DC shifts occurred; in Group 3, the (nonischemic) frontal pole of the ischemic hemisphere was electrically stimulated to increase the frequency of periinfarct DC shifts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Animals underwent perfusion-fixation 24 h later, and volumes of complete infarction and scattered neuronal injury ("incomplete infarction") were assessed on stained coronal sections by quantitative planimetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Electrical induction of SD in Group 1 did not cause morphological injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During the initial 3 h following <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion, the number of spontaneous periinfarct depolarization in Group 2 (7.0 +/- 1.5 DC shifts) was doubled in Group 3 by frontal current application (13.4 +/- 2.7 DC shifts; p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The duration as well as the integrated negative amplitude of DC shifts over time were significantly greater in Group 3 than in Group 2 rats (duration, 5.7 +/- 3.8 vs. 4.1 +/- 2.5 min; p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Histopathological examination disclosed well-defined areas of pannecrosis surrounded by a cortical rim exhibiting selectively damaged acidophilic neurons and astrocytic swelling in otherwise <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-appearing brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Induction of SD in the ischemic hemisphere led to a significant increase in the volume of incomplete infarction (19.0 +/- 6.1 mm3 in Group 3 vs. 10.3 +/- 5.1 mm3 in Group 2; p &lt; 0.01) and of total ischemic injury (100.7 +/- 41.0 mm3 in Group 3 vs. 66.5 +/- 24.7 mm3 in Group 2; p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The integrated magnitude of DC negativity per experiment correlated significantly with the volume of total ischemic injury (r = 0.780, p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Thus, induction of SD in the ischemic hemisphere accentuated the development of scattered neuronal injury and increased the volume of total ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This observation may be explained by the fact that with limited perfusion reserve, periinfarct depolarization are associated with episodic energy failure in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischemic penumbra </plain></SENT>
