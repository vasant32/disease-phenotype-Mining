<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As CsA does not readily cross the blood-brain barrier, the variability may be due to differences in bioavailability of CsA to the ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have, therefore, quantitated CsA levels in blood and brain following intra-carotid injection in rats undergoing permanent right middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion using a three-vessel model of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After 30 min of three-vessel occlusion, CsA (10 mg/kg) was injected into the left external carotid artery followed by reversal of the left common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At various times post-injection, blood samples were collected from the vena cava and samples of ischemic or sham-operated cortex were obtained for CsA quantitation by tandem mass spectrometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined using non-linear mixed-effects modeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CsA areas under the curve between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-induced rats were not significantly different in blood (18355 vs. 19405 ng x h/ml, NS) or in brain tissue (15664 vs. 14931 ng x h/g, NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that intra-carotid injection of CsA results in high levels in brain (brain-blood ratio from 0.5 to 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant differences in blood and brain exposure were observed between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-induced rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, reduced cerebral blood flow in the ischemic territory did not limit CsA availability to the cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, CsA intra-carotid administration was neuroprotective following 24 h recovery as there was a significant decrease in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> area of the affected hemisphere compared to saline injected rats as estimated by TTC staining of viable tissue </plain></SENT>
