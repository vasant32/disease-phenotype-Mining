<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This can be mimicked in the neonatal rat, but produces variable injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study investigated the influence of <z:mp ids='MP_0002288'>litter size</z:mp> on the severity and variability of damage caused by hypoxic-ischemic injury in neonatal rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Groups of 7-d-old pups from birth-sized litters (13-15 pups), or from litters culled to 10 on postnatal d 2, and 8- and 9-d-old pups from birth-sized litters, were exposed to common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and then, 3 h later, <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> (2 h 15 min, 8% oxygen) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Damage was assessed histologically 72 h after injury, and graded (I-IV) according to severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In nonculled litters, similar numbers of animals had each grade of injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most pups (70%) from culled litters had grade III or IV damage, and severity was significantly greater than in nonculled litters (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pups from culled litters were heavier (17.6 +/- 0.4 g) than pups from nonculled litters (14.7 +/- 0.3 g, p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>To determine whether this indicated that culled litters were more similar to older pups in their response to hypoxic-ischemic injury, we examined injury in 8- and 9-d-old pups of similar body weight to 7-d-old pups from culled litters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The severity and distribution of damage in the older pups was different from damage in the 7-d-old pups from culled litters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that in 7-d-old rats, <z:mp ids='MP_0002288'>litter size</z:mp> influences damage caused by hypoxic-ischemic injury, and that the relationship between body weight, brain development, and susceptibility to hypoxic-ischemic injury is complex </plain></SENT>
