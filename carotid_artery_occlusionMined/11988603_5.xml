<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: After <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, it is often standard practice to obtain magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) to seek evidence of a plausible <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, hemodynamic patterns after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> are variable and dynamic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated information obtained by serial transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (TCD) examinations within the first week after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and compared it with that obtained from a single MRA study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-seven patients (aged 61+/-7 years) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischemic hemispheric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>TCD was performed within 24 hours, from 24 to 48 hours, and 4 to 8 days after ictus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Norms for TCD examination were determined in an age-matched control group that included 41 subjects without cerebrovascular disease (aged 57+/-10 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 17 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients, the results of initial TCD examination were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, although TCD follow-up showed gradual deterioration of middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) for 1 patient with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> MRA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 12 patients, initial TCD study and MRA showed <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> or posterior cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Serial TCD examinations documented recanalization (6 patients), formation of a residual <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis (1 patient), or progressive deterioration of flow through a symptomatic <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> (1 patient), not evident on MRA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 5 patients MRA was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, but early TCD demonstrated signs of previous recanalization (transitory hyperemia, slow flow restoration) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In 2 patients with <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> branch occlusion, MRA suggested occlusion but failed to document either improvement (1 patient) or deterioration (1 patient) of flow that was evident with serial TCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In 4 patients with proximal <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis and 5 patients with internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> or stenosis, serial TCD demonstrated different patterns of collateralization and suggested dynamic collateralization patterns after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> that were not evident on MRA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Serial TCD examination may reveal dynamic changes in cerebral circulation that may be missed on a single MRA study </plain></SENT>
