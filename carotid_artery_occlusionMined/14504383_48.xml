<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Substantial evidence now exists that intrinsic <z:chebi fb="19" ids="26519">free-radical</z:chebi> scavenging contributes to the receptor-independent neuroprotective effects of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50114">estrogens</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This activity is inherently associated with the presence of a phenolic A-ring in the steroid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report a previously unrecognized <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> cycle that maintains the "chemical shield" raised by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50114">estrogens</z:chebi> against the most harmful reactive oxygen species, the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29191">hydroxyl radical</z:chebi> (*OH) produced by the Fenton reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this cycle, the capture of *OH was shown to produce a nonphenolic quinol with no affinity to the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This quinol is then rapidly converted back to the parent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> via an enzyme-catalyzed reduction by using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="13392">NAD(P)H</z:chebi> as a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23354">coenzyme</z:chebi> (reductant) and, unlike redox cycling of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="18135">catechol</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50114">estrogens</z:chebi>, without the production of reactive oxygen species </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Due to this process, protection of neuronal cells against <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> is also possible by quinols that essentially act as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50266">prodrugs</z:chebi> for the active hormone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We have shown that the quinol obtained from a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16469">17beta-estradiol</z:chebi> derivative was, indeed, able to attenuate <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> in cultured hippocampus-derived HT-22 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="17263">Estrone</z:chebi> quinol was also equipotent with its parent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> in reducing lesion volume in ovariectomized rats after transient middle carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> followed by a 24-h reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings may establish the foundation for a rational design of neuroprotective <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidants</z:chebi> focusing on steroidal quinols as unique molecular leads </plain></SENT>
