<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Blood supply to tissues is inevitably reduced in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, it remains poorly understood whether the reduced blood flow is the cause of increased peripheral chemoreflex sensitivity in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This work highlights the effect of chronically reduced blood flow to the carotid body (CB) on peripheral chemoreflex function in rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In pacing-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e> rabbits, blood flow in the carotid artery was reduced by 36.4 Â± 5.2% after 3 weeks of pacing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For comparison, a similar level of blood flow reduction was induced by carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (CAO) over a similar 3 week time course without pacing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CB blood supply was reduced by similar levels in both <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e> and CAO rabbits as measured with fluorescent microspheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with sham rabbits, CAO enhanced peripheral chemoreflex sensitivity in vivo, increased CB chemoreceptor activity in an isolated CB preparation and decreased outward <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> current (Ik) in CB glomus cells to levels similar to those that were observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e> rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In CAO CB compared to sham, neural nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) synthase (nNOS) expression and NO levels were suppressed, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="48432">Ang II</z:chebi>) type 1 receptor (AT1-R) protein expression and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48432">Ang II</z:chebi> concentration were elevated; these changes were similar to those seen in the CB from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e> rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A NO donor and AT1-R <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> reversed CAO-enhanced chemoreflex sensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that a reduction of blood flow to the CB is involved in the augmentation of peripheral chemoreflex sensitivity in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHF</z:e> </plain></SENT>
