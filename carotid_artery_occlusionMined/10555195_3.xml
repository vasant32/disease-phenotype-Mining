<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to examine the inter-relation between the hemodynamic events, energy metabolism, extracellular <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> and electrical activity during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">transient ischemia</z:e> in the gerbil brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has already been shown that partial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in the gerbil brain causes changes in the blood flow, oxygen tension, electrical activity and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="29103">potassium ion</z:chebi> efflux </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the description of the event during brain recovery from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">transient ischemia</z:e> is not documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In order to enable a better understanding of the pathophysiology during the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> as well as during reperfusion, we used the multiparametric assembly system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This system enables simultaneous and continuous monitoring of CBF, intra-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16908">NADH</z:chebi>, extracellular <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi>, DC potential and ECoG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty anesthetized gerbils underwent reversible carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> procedure for 3-4 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>While monitoring the various parameters until complete recovery was reached, we found high correlation between the CBF and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16908">NADH</z:chebi> during occlusion as well as during the reperfusion period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, CBF at the reperfusion period increased above the basal level while <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16908">NADH</z:chebi> returned to base line without an undershoot, suggesting that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> need for oxygen necessary for the production of ATP is not the only factor influencing CBF during reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16908">NADH</z:chebi> returned to its <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> level before extracellular <z:chebi fb="3" ids="29103">potassium ion</z:chebi> levels recovered to the baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This may suggest that ATP was no longer the limiting factor and ion pump activity became the factor determining and affecting the recovery processes </plain></SENT>
