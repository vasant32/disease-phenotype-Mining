<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since no model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006970'>periventricular leukomalacia</z:hpo> has been established in small animals, it is expected to establish a new model of white matter injury in immature rodents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Bilateral carotid arteries were occluded in neonatal rats at 5 days of age, and the brain neuropathologically examined at 7 days of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among 22 brains histologically examined, 20 (90.9%) had white matter changes including coagulation <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> and cystic lesions in and around the internal capsule, while only two had small <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> and five showed some ischemic neurons in the cerebral cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow (CBF) decreased to about 25% of controls in the subcortical white matter in the animals with bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (BCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Amyloid precursor protein (APP) immunohistochemistry demonstrated various APP-immunoreactive axonal profiles in the internal capsule and the subcortical white matter, and stronger expression of APP in pyramidal neurons in the cerebral cortex of BCAO brains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results indicated that the white matter is more vulnerable than the cerebral cortex in 5-day-old rats when CBF decreases to about 25% and suggested that this model is useful for investigating the white matter changes induced by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1695782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral hypoperfusion</z:e> in the neonatal brain, since previous models of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0752304" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoxic-ischemic brain injury</z:e> in neonatal mice and rats revealed preferential susceptibility of the gray matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It was also indicated that APP is a sensitive marker for mild axonal disruption in the white matter of the immature brain </plain></SENT>
