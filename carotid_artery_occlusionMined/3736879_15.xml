<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-treated animals survived more than twice as long as saline-treated littermates </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neuropathologic analysis of recovered animals at 30 days of age showed that the brains of the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-treated animals were no more damaged than those of the saline controls (p greater than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The finding indicates that, unlike adults, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> supplementation and its associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> in the immature rat does not increase the extent of hypoxic-ischemic brain damage </plain></SENT>
