<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Evidence of collateral circulation via the anterior communicating artery was observed less frequently (88%) among patients with ischaemic lesions in the anterior and middle cerebral artery distribution, as well as the border zone area between these arteries, than in those with ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> in the border zone area between posterior and middle cerebral arteries (100%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In patients in whom focal lesions were not found on CT, good collateral circulation via ophthalmic (100%), anterior communicating (100%) and posterior cerebral (84%) arteries was found on transcranial USG-D </plain></SENT>
