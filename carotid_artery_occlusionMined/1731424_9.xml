<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study we evaluated the combined treatment of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">N-methyl-D-aspartate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> dizocilpine (MK-801) and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50075">dihydropyridine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> channel blocker nicardipine for the reduction of hippocampal CA1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was induced by bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in the gerbil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Body temperature was maintained between 36.5 degrees C and 37.5 degrees C during surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MK-801 (5.0 mg/kg) was injected 15 minutes after occlusion whereas nicardipine was given by injection and via a micro-osmotic pump (1.0 mg/kg/day) for 3 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Postischemic treatment with MK-801 reduced CA1 cell loss by 27.0%, whereas nicardipine reduced CA1 cell loss by 13.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Combined postischemic treatment with these drugs yielded an additive, protective effect (44.5% reduction of CA1 loss) that did not appear to result from postischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> as assessed by skull and rectal temperature recordings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that MK-801 plus nicardipine significantly attenuates CA1 cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> after forebrain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in the gerbil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Excitatory amino acid <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> in combination with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> channel <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> may be an effective therapy in patients exposed to global ischemic insult </plain></SENT>
