<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A case is presented of ruptured "true" posterior communicating artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> thirteen years after surgical occlusion of the ipsilateral cervical internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 58-year-old female developed the sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000508'>blepharoptosis</z:hpo> on the right side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>She had had a right superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery anastomosis and a surgical occlusion of the right cervical internal carotid artery 13 years earlier for a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> that occurred as the result of a ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the right internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neurological examination on admission revealed an occulomotor palsy on the right </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cerebral angiograms demonstrated an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> arising from the right posterior communicating artery itself near the right posterior cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Also, the right intracranial internal carotid artery was supplied through the right posterior communicating artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five days later she experienced the sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CT scan showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> in the ambient cistern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neck clipping of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was successfully performed by the contralateral zygomatic approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The postoperative course was uneventful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It has been well known that internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> may be associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysm</z:hpo> in some cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, it seems to be very rare that a "true" posterior communicating artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> should occur following the ipsilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Hemodynamic factors were strongly suggested as the reason for aneurysmal formation in this case </plain></SENT>
