<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The accuracy of noninvasive techniques in this setting remains questionable, with the result that contrast arteriography remains the diagnostic method of choice in patients in whom ICA occlusion is suspected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ocular pneumoplethysmography-Gee (OPG-Gee) is one of the noninvasive methods that is still utilized extensively in the evaluation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In order to determine the real utility of OPG-Gee, the authors conducted a retrospective comparison of the results of OPG-Gee and arteriography in 26 patients (52 internal carotid arteries) who had undergone both examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>[table: see text] With the angiography results as the standard of comparison, 4 incorrect diagnoses were obtained by OPG-Gee, thus yielding an overall accuracy of 92 for this method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, duplex ultrasonography, also performed in the same 26 patients, correctly identified the 2 ICA occlusions defined by angiography and further demonstrated patency in the 48 arteries so shown by angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The authors conclude from this experience that OPG-Gee is less reliable than duplex ultrasonography in the diagnosis of ICA occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, despite the 92% overall accuracy of their results with OPG-Gee, the occurrence of both false-positive and false-negative results renders this examination modality suspect in the diagnosis of ICA occlusion </plain></SENT>
