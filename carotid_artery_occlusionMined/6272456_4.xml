<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study the rat brain was monitored non-invasively in the intact skull by transillumination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The data show that an increase in cerebral deoxygenation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>, which occurs simultaneously with a decrease in blood volume subsequent to carotid ligation, acts as a compensatory mechanism to assist in maintaining aerobic energy metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The observations also demonstrate that in this species the effects of bilateral carotid occlusion on the cerebrovascular parameters are not necessarily irrevocable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The intramitochondrial metabolic alterations, as evaluated by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> oxidase redox transitions, are reversible as long as the systemic arterial blood pressure does not fall below a value of approximately 40 mm Hg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that possibility of being able to use a critical reduction level of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> oxidase as an early indication of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced cerebral metabolic dysfunction prior to major changes in high energy stores </plain></SENT>
