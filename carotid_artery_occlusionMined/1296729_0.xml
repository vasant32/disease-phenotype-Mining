<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two series of study were performed; the permanent BCAO and 3-hr-BCAO study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After permanent BCAO, the survival rate at 24 hrs of 32% (8 mg/kg, i.p.) or 38% (16mg/kg) in NIC group was higher than that in non-treated group (12%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At the end of 3-hr-BCAO, the increase in water content (dry-wet) in di-mesencephalon was less in NIC (100 micrograms/kg/min, i.v.) group than that in non-treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The decrease in LCBF in caudate-putamen (CP), parietal cortex (PC), thalamus (TH), hypothalamus (HT), and substantia nigra (SN) were less in NIC group than those in non-treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At the 2-hr-reperfusion after 3-hr-BCAO, the decrease in LCBF in TH and HT were less in NIC group than those in non-treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The LCGU in sensory motor cortex, CP, PC, HT, inferior colliculus and pons-reticular were higher in NIC group than those in non-treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>From these results, it is concluded that nicergoline may have ameliorative effects on survival rate related to the prevention of decreased cerebral blood flow and metabolism following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
