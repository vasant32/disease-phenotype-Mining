<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Brain injury and myelination changes were examined on postnatal day 21 (P21) and tests for neurobehavioral toxicity were performed from P3 to P21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>BCAO followed by 10 or 15 min hypoxic insult resulted in mild and severe, respectively, brain injury, reduction in mature oligodendrocytes and tyrosine hydroxylase positive neurons and impaired myelination as indicated by decreased myelin basic protein immunostaining in the P21 rat brain </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BCAO followed by 15 min of <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> caused more severely impaired neurobehavioral performance as compared with BCAO followed by 10 min of <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> in the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The overall results demonstrate that <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced brain injury not only persists, but also is linked with neurobehavioral deficits in juvenile rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The present data also indicate that the degree of brain injury and the deficits of neurobehavioral performance in the rat are dependent on the hypoxic-ischemic condition, i.e., the exposure time to <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
