<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The examinations were performed on either an inpatient or an outpatient basis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Renografin-76 was injected into an arm vein through an angiocatheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Extracranial examinations accurately demonstrated major artery disease such as carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, stenosis, and ulceration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intracranial examinations demonstrated an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> in 9 of 10 patients and an <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformation</z:hpo> in 5 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The technique was useful in assessing the results of cerebrovascular procedures such as carotid endarterectomy, superficial temporal artery to middle cerebral artery bypass, and the obliteration of vascular anomalies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DSA also excluded the presence of an intrasellar <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and showed the location of the intracranial arteries before trans-sphenoidal surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The findings of the DSA examinations correlated closely with the findings of conventional angiography </plain></SENT>
