<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The bilateral common carotid arteries of Wistar rats were occluded for 0, 2, 7, and 28 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cerebral energy metabolism was evaluated by assaying <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15422">adenosine triphosphate</z:chebi> (ATP), phosphocreatine (PCr), and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> levels and measuring <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (PDH) activity (each time point, n = 6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pathological changes were assessed light-microscopically by Kl√ºver-Barrera staining and immunohistochemical labeling for astroglia (each time point, n = 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were no changes in ATP and PCr levels or PDH activity; there was slight but significant transient <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> accumulation at 2 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Myelin <z:hpo ids='HP_0000980'>pallor</z:hpo> and increase in immuno-reactive astroglia were only observed at 28 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1695782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral hypoperfusion</z:e> induces delayed white matter changes in the corpus callosum of rat brain, but does not affect energy production </plain></SENT>
