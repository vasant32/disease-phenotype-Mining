<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have previously demonstrated an increase in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels of certain Ca(2+)-independent forms of PKC in early recirculation periods i.e., 6 h and 24 h postischemia (PI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>But, since neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in susceptible regions usually occurs 2-3 days following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, this study examined the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels of PKC after prolonged periods of reperfusion following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was also examined at an early recirculation period, i.e., 1 h, to determine how early the alterations begin to occur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Global forebrain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was produced in gerbils by 10 min of bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> was prepared from forebrains of nonischemic controls and PI animals following 1 h, 3 d, and 7 d of recirculation (n = 3 to 4 in each group) and hybridized with synthetic oligonucleotide probes for PKC, delta, epsilon, and zeta based on cDNA sequences in rat and labelled with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37972">32P</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The autoradiographs were recorded and quantified by a sensitive system, <z:chebi fb="27" ids="28659">Phosphor</z:chebi> Imager, followed by conventional x-ray film exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 PKC isozymes examined were found to be elevated as early as 1 h recirculation following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The increases in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels of both delta PKC following 6 h and 24 h of recirculation as well as that of zeta PKC following 24 h of recirculation, as reported earlier, return to control levels by 3 d PI and remain at that level 7 d PI.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
