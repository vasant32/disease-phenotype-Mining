<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By using [3H]glycine to label this modulatory site, we found that the compounds with the highest affinity (Ki less than 1 microM) contained a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47853">chloro group</z:chebi> at position C-6 and a polar, hydrogen-bond-accepting group at position C-3 of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35581">indole</z:chebi> ring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When these compounds were tested for their ability to modulate [3H]MK-801 [(+)-[3H]-5-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d]cyclophepten-5,10- <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24783">imine</z:chebi> maleate) binding, a functional assessment of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> receptor activation, binding was inhibited, indicative of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> character </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Schild regression analysis indicated that this antagonism was competitive with glycine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Next, several of these <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35581">indole</z:chebi>-2-carboxylate derivatives were analyzed electrophysiologically in rat cortex <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>-injected Xenopus oocytes shown to express a functional <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> receptor channel complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These compounds inhibited <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> receptor activity in a manner noncompetitive with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>They also produced a parallel right-ward shift in the glycine dose response for potentiation of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> responses in the oocytes and thus provided further evidence for a competitive interaction at the glycine site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, in vivo transient bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> experiments revealed that these compounds were capable of reducing the damage typically associated with an ischemic insult in Mongolian gerbil hippocampal neurons </plain></SENT>
