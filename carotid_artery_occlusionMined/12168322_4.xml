<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To investigate the possible role of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, we have monitored the intracranial pressure (ICP) and local cerebral blood flow (ICBF) following bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (BCAO) in GFAP-null mice and their <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> littermates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>GFAP-null mice (B6, 129-GfaptmlMes) were obtained from Jackson Laboratories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The ICP and ICBF was continuously monitored during 15 minutes BCAO and reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The variation of the circle of Willis was also investigated in both GFAP-null and <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The breakdown of blood brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) was assessed by immunohistochemical staining against mouse immunogloblins (IgG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A significantly more profound and immediate decrease in ICBF after BCAO was observed in GFAP-null mice (p &lt; 0.04, ANOVA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>GFAP-null mice also showed a significant increase (% change) in ICP after reperfusion (p &lt; 0.05, ANOVA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no gross differences in the circle of Willis between GFAP-null and <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No abnormal IgG immuno-reactivity was observed in the forebrain of both animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results indicate a high susceptibility to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in GFAP-null mice and suggest an important role for astrocytes and GFAP in the progress of ischemic brain damage and increased ICP after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> with reperfusion </plain></SENT>
