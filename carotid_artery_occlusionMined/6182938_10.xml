<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>2 Pressor responses to bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> were significantly lower in <z:chebi fb="8" ids="3374">capsaicin</z:chebi>-treated rats compared with vehicle-treated controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pressor responses to intravenously injected <z:chebi fb="15" ids="33569">noradrenaline</z:chebi> were similar in the two groups of rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>3 Resting respiratory minute volume and tidal volume were lower in anaesthetized <z:chebi fb="8" ids="3374">capsaicin</z:chebi>-treated animals than in vehicle-treated controls, but there was no significant difference in respiratory frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>4 The increases in respiration evoked by intravenous administration of the peripheral arterial chemoreceptor stimulant, <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33192">sodium cyanide</z:chebi>, or by breathing a hypoxic gas mixture, were significantly lower in <z:chebi fb="8" ids="3374">capsaicin</z:chebi>-treated rats compared with the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>5 It is concluded that baroreceptor and chemoreceptor reflex activity are significantly reduced in anaesthetized adult rats which had been treated neonatally with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="3374">capsaicin</z:chebi>, and that this is likely to result from the destruction of unmyelinated baro- and chemoreceptor afferent fibres </plain></SENT>
