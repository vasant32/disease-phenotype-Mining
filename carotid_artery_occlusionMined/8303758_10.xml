<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Evidence linking changes in calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II activity with ischemic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> has been reported in animal models of global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to delineate the course of these changes after focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and to clarify the relation of changes in activity of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II to the process of ischemic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Change in calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II activity was evaluated in a rat model of focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> after 5 minutes, 30 minutes, and 1 hour of tandem middle cerebral artery and common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> both with and without reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II activity was significantly decreased after <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three durations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> followed by immediate decapitation compared with sham-operated animals, in both ischemic core and border-zone regions (P &lt; .05 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>Depression</z:hpo> of activity occurred in a regionally graded fashion, with the most severe decrease in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> core and progressively smaller decreases in samples moving out from the center, corresponding to the severity of histological injury later detected in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> core and border-zone regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were only minor differences between the three durations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in the degree of enzyme <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> noted in the more peripheral regions, indicating that the initial decrease in calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II activity is an early, sensitive marker for an ischemic insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After reperfusion, the differences between the 5-minute group and longer periods of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> widened because of an increase toward baseline in the 5-minute group and a trend toward further decrease in the 30- and 60-minute groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The extreme sensitivity of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II to focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and the parallel temporal and regional changes in its activity to those of more delayed cell injury point to a potential role for this enzyme in the process of excitotoxic injury </plain></SENT>
