<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We examined the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi> on ischemic neuronal injury in the rat forebrain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>Cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was achieved with bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and controlled <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> to a mean of 50 torr for 10 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Perfusion-fixation was performed 7 days after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, subsequent to which the brains were sectioned coronally and stained with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ischemic neuronal injury was quantitatively expressed (after direct counting) as a percentage of total neurons, that is, ischemic neurons divided by (ischemic neurons + <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> neurons) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Predictably, the selectively vulnerable hippocampal areas exhibited the most marked neuronal injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the CA1/CA2 sectors, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi>-treated rats demonstrated less injury (34 +/- 14%) than untreated (64 +/- 9%) or saline-treated (70 +/- 10%) rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, these superficially pronounced numerical differences were not of statistical significance (p greater than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the CA3 sector, neuronal injury in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi>-treated rats (31 +/- 14%) was significantly different at p less than 0.05 from the untreated (80 +/- 5%) but not the saline-treated (59 +/- 13%) group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6456">lidocaine</z:chebi> may have an only marginal beneficial effect on forebrain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in rats </plain></SENT>
