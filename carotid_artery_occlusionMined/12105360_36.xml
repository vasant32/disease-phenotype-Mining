<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This is a retrospective case series from a prospectively collected <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> database for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> internal carotid occlusion presenting within 6 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> to evaluate safety, feasibility, and response to thrombolytic therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The University Hospital-based <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038454" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain attack</z:e> database was reviewed over a 5-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Demographics, clinical features, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> mechanisms, severity, imaging findings, type of thrombolysis, treatment responses, mortality, and long-term outcome using modified Rankin Scale and Barthel Index were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The short-term outcome was assessed using the National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> thrombolytic therapy was administered using recombinant tissue plasminogen activator or urokinase given intra-arterially or in combination with intravenous (IV) routes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two hundred seven patients treated with thrombolysis between 1995 and 2000 were reviewed, and of these, 101 were studied with cerebral angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eighteen patients were identified with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and ipsilateral occlusion of the distal internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Time to treatment was the most powerful predictor of response to thrombolytic therapy (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The response to therapy also correlated well with the severity of the initial clinical deficit as judged by the NIHSS (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in recanalization rate, symptomatic <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, and NIHSS for IV/intra-arterial (IA) versus IA alone (P=NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Complete angiographic recanalization was accomplished in 80% of those who received combined IV/IA thrombolysis and in 62% of those who received IA therapy (P=NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Those with distal occlusions extending to the middle and anterior cerebral arteries were the least likely to respond to thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> occurred in 20% of the patients receiving IV/IA therapy, and in 15% of the IA only (P=NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>At 24 hours, the NIHSS dropped by 3 points in the IA group and 4 points in the IV/IA group (P=NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Mild disability with independence was found in 77% of the survivors at 3-month follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The mortality rate was 50% in this group despite thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Thrombolytic therapy using a combination of IV and IA routes and using the IA-only route may be effective in improving outcome for the patients suffering from occlusion of the distal internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Shorter intervals between <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and treatment seem to be correlated with higher rate of recanalization and improved outcome </plain></SENT>
