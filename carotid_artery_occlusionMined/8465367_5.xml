<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The advent of faster computed tomography scanners has evoked considerable interest in using this technology as a more practical method of regional cerebral hemodynamic evaluation than the currently available <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission and single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The theoretical concepts have been worked out and validated in the laboratory by several groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was the development of a clinically useful system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Software was developed for dynamic computed tomography-based calculation and color-coded representation of regional cerebral blood flow and blood volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> values, reproducibility, and sensitivity to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> challenge were established in 13 volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The method was applied to an additional three patients with internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and known decreased vascular reserve capacity as diagnosed by transcranial Doppler ultrasonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> regional cerebral blood flow was determined as 50 +/- 13 ml/100 ml per minute and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> fractional cerebral blood volume as 58 +/- 12 ml/1,000 ml (mean +/- SD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In five volunteers, two examinations were performed within 15 minutes for determination of reproducibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Intermeasurement variability of hemispheric blood flow and blood volume was determined as +/- 23% and +/- 16%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Intravenous administration of 1 g <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> resulted on the average in a 75% increase of blood flow and a 65% increase of fractional blood volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the patients with decreased cerebrovascular reserve capacity, baseline fractional blood volume in the ischemic hemispheres was significantly increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Baseline regional cerebral blood flow in the ischemic territories was overestimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Reactivity to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> of both regional blood flow and fractional blood volume was clearly reduced in the ischemic hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The present results demonstrate that the method is a simple and effective means of determining regional cerebral blood volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Spatial resolution is superior to that of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35207">radioactive tracer</z:chebi> methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Hemodynamic evaluation of ischemic conditions can be performed on the basis of increased resting cerebral blood volume and a diminished increase after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Accuracy of cerebral blood flow measurements, on the other hand, is affected by abnormal cerebral blood volume, and corresponding adjustments need to be made in pathological conditions </plain></SENT>
