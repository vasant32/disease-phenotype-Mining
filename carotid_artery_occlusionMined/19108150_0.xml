<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The action of 5,5-diethyl-1,3-oxazine-2,4-dione (dioxone) has been studied in rats, rabbits, cats and dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Dioxone produced a marked stimulation of respiration in anaesthetized, decerebrate and spinal animals when given in doses that did not induce <z:mp ids='MP_0000947'>convulsions</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This effect was generally accompanied by a rise in blood pressure, which was more marked in cats than in dogs and rabbits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Dioxone antagonized the respiratory and circulatory <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> due to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7983">pentobarbitone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The respiratory stimulating effect of dioxone appears to be 2 or 3 times greater than that of leptazol, and comparable to that of megimide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Like leptazol, nikethamide and megimide, dioxone has no direct effect on cardiac function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Dioxone did not elicit respiratory and blood pressure changes when allowed to come in contact with the carotid sinus receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Dioxone enhanced the reflex excitability of bulbar centres, as demonstrated by the increase in respiratory response either to temporary common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in dogs or to electrical stimulation of the central cut end of Hering's nerve in the cat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Dioxone also reduced the inhibition of respiration induced by electrical stimulation of the central cut end of the vagus nerve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Whether this central action of dioxone is direct or not cannot at present be elucidated, though a section at intercollicular level did not prevent the respiratory stimulation produced by this substance </plain></SENT>
