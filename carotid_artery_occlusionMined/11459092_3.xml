<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Clinical and experimental data on cerebral blood flow (CBF) changes during spinal cord stimulation (SCS) were published since 1986 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aims of the present work are: 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To find an experimental model of reliable, simple and in vivo monitoring of "early" basilar artery spasm after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid haemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) and 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To investigate the effects of cervical spinal cord stimulation (CSCS) on it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Vasospasm due to SAH is both "<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>" and "recurrent" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Early spasm occurs within minutes of the SAH. its duration is approximately 1 hour </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The need of different morphological and haemodynamic methods to evaluate experimental early spasm is reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To overcome intracranial surgical manipulations and biological effects of contrast and fixation media we designed a model that allows "in vivo" functional monitoring of basilar blood flow far away from the spasm without direct surgical and chemical interference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Subsequently we investigated the effects of CSCS on the new model of "functional monitoring" of the "early" <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265110" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral vasospasm</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>METHOD: 29 adult Burgundy rabbits were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Group 1: under homeostatic monitoring, "on-line" carotid blood flow (carotid BF) changes produced by SAH in cisterna magna of 12 (plus 5 sham treated) animals were studied from the common carotid artery after external carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> before, during SAH and up to the end of the experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the animals underwent digital subtraction cerebral panangiography (CPA) after SAH obtaining a significant increase of carotid BF only when basilar vasospasm was shown by CPA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Carotid BF increase during basilar vasospasm was defined "functional monitoring" of early spasm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Group 2: Twelve animals wearing a cervical epidural electrode underwent carotid BF "functional monitoring" of early basilar spasm before and during CSCS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: Carotid BF changes during CSCS occurred in 10 animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>No carotid BF changes (i.e. no basilar vasospasm) occurred after SAH up to the end of the experiments in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the stimulated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: CSCS is able to prevent "early spasm" due to SAH in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the animals studied with the new model of "functional monitoring" described, independently from the occurence and the sign for stimulation-induced carotid BF variations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The role and the limits of reversible functional sympathectomy in mediating the effect of CSCS on early vasospam are discussed </plain></SENT>
