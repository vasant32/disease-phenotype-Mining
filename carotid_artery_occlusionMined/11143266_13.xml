<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between July 1992 and October 1998, 92 patients harboring benign cavernous sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0002858'>meningiomas</z:hpo> underwent GKS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study is concerned with the first 80 consecutive patients (63 women and 17 men) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Gamma knife radiosurgery was performed as an alternative to surgical removal in 50 cases and as an adjuvant to microsurgery in 30 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean patient age was 49 years (range 6-71 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> volume was 5.8 cm3 (range 0.9-18.6 cm3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) imaging the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> was confined in 66 cases and extensive in 14 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean prescription dose was 28 Gy (range 12-50 Gy), delivered with an average of eight isocenters (range two-18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median peripheral isodose was 50% (range 30-70%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients were evaluated at 6 months, and at 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7 years after GKS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up period was 30.5 months (range 12-79 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> stabilization after GKS was noted in 51 patients, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> shrinkage in 25 patients, and enlargement in four patients requiring surgical removal in two cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The 5-year actuarial progression-free survival was 92.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No new oculomotor deficit was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Among the 54 patients with oculomotor nerve deficits, 15 improved, eight recovered, and one worsened </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Among the 13 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100661'>trigeminal neuralgia</z:hpo>, one worsened (contemporary of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> growing), five remained unchanged, four improved, and three recovered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In a patient with a remnant surrounding the optic nerve and preoperative low vision (3/10) the decision was to treat the lesion and deliberately sacrifice the residual visual acuity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Only one transient unexpected <z:hpo ids='HP_0001138'>optic neuropathy</z:hpo> has been observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>One case of delayed intracavernous carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> occurred 3 months after GKS, without permanent deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Another patient presented with partial complex <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> 18 months after GKS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> and neurological deficits observed after GKS occurred before the use of GammaPlan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Since the initiation of systematic use of stereotactic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging and computer-assisted modern dose planning, no more side effects or cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598934" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor growth</z:e> have occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Gamma knife radiosurgery was found to be an effective low morbidity-related tool for the treatment of cavernous sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0002858'>meningioma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>In a significant number of patients, oculomotor functional restoration was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>The treatment appears to be an alternative to surgical removal of confined enclosed cavernous sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0002858'>meningioma</z:hpo> and should be proposed as an adjuvant to surgery in case of extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002858'>meningiomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
