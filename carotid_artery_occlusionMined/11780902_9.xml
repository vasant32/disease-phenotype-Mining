<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixteen adult male Mongolian gerbils underwent transient bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One week later, cell suspensions prepared from fetal human brain were injected using stereotactic guidance into the CA1 region of the hippocampus on one side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the contralateral side injection of the cell suspension medium only was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One week after transplantation, the animals were perfusion fixed and their brains were processed for histological studies as well as expression of neuron and glia-specific antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Data from ischemic animals were compared with eight nonischemic gerbils that served as sham-operated controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Last, the in vivo data were correlated with observations made from matching in vitro cultures of the fetal brain cell suspension </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The in vivo data indicated that transplanted human fetus-derived brain cells survived in ischemic lesions of gerbil hippocampus after 1 week, provided that the host animal underwent adequate immunosuppression and the transplanted cells were not incorporated into the scar caused by the transplantation procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Unlike their in vivo counterparts, after 1 week, most cultured fetal brain cells expressed either neuron- or astrocyte-specific antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This work demonstrates that xenotransplanted fetal human brain cells are able to survive in an ischemic lesion in a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1519106" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">rodent model</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data might be useful for future neural transplantation studies of treatments for cerebrovascular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in humans </plain></SENT>
