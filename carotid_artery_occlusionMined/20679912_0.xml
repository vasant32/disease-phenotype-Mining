<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Common carotid artery (CCA) occlusive disease may cause hemodynamic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> resulting in the development of ischemic symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The blood flow in the superficial temporal artery (STA) ipsilateral to the occluded CCA is usually poor, which limits its use as a donor artery for extracranial-intracranial arterial bypass surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL PRESENTATION: Despite antiplatelet therapy, recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> manifesting as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002427'>motor aphasia</z:hpo> developed in a 72-year-old man </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neuroradiological imaging revealed misery perfusion in the bilateral cerebral hemispheres caused by left CCA occlusion and right internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Blood flow from the STA contralateral to the occluded CCA perfused the ipsilateral STA over the midline in a retrograde fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: After confirming the direction and the pressure of the blood flow in the spontaneously formed "bonnet" STA, the STA was anastomosed to a cortical artery in the symptomatic frontal lobe so that blood flow in the ipsilateral STA was supplied from the contralateral STA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The procedure was accomplished without difficulty, and no further ischemic symptoms developed after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Postoperative cerebral angiography demonstrated an increase in collateral flow to the anastomosed bonnet STA and perfusion to an entire territory of the upper trunk of the symptomatic middle cerebral artery via the anastomosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This case suggests that arterial bypass surgery can be performed using a spontaneously formed bonnet STA as a donor in a patient with symptomatic CCA occlusion </plain></SENT>
