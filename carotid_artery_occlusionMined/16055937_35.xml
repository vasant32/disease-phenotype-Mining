<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>No effective therapy is currently available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The hematopoietic cytokine erythropoietin (Epo) provides neuroprotection in many adult models of brain injury and is currently being investigated as a therapeutic agent for human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and spinal cord injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We tested the hypothesis that recombinant Epo (rEpo) would improve neurobehavioral outcomes after neonatal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0752304" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoxic-ischemic brain injury</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Postnatal day 7 rats underwent right common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> followed by a 90-min exposure to 8% oxygen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rats were subsequently treated with rEpo or placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751419" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Sensory neglect</z:e> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="48538">apomorphine</z:chebi>-induced rotation were measured at P27 and P28 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Rats were killed at P30, blood was drawn, and the brains were perfusion-fixed for histology and immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No differences in gross brain injury between rEpo and placebo-treated rats were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Neonatal rEpo treatment protected <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> neurons as indicated by the preservation of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive cells in the substantia nigra pars compacta and ventral tegmental area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>rEpo treatment also improved functional outcomes by reducing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751419" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">sensory neglect</z:e> and preventing the rotational asymmetry seen in control animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No differences in hematocrit, white blood cell counts, neutrophil counts, or platelet counts were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We observed that rEpo treatment protected mesencephalic <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> neurons and reduced the degree of behavioral asymmetries at 4 wk of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>On the basis of these findings, we conclude that further studies investigating the safety and efficacy of high-dose rEpo as a neuroprotective strategy are indicated in neonatal models of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0752304" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoxic-ischemic brain injury</z:e> </plain></SENT>
