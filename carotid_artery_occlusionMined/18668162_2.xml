<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To estimate protective potential of citicoline in a model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004045" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">birth asphyxia</z:e>, the drug was given to 7-day old rats subjected to permanent unilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and exposed for 65 min to a hypoxic gas mixture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Daily citicoline doses of 100 or 300 m/kg, or vehicle, were injected intraperitoneally for 7 consecutive days beginning immediately after the end of the ischemic-hypoxic insult, and brain damage was assessed by gross zorphology score and weight deficit two weeks after the insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Caspase-3, alpha-fodrin, Bcl-2, and Hsp70 levels were assessed at 0, 1, and 24 h after the end of the hypoxic insult in another group of rat pups subjected to the same insult and given a single dose of 300 m/kg of citicoline or the vehicle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Citicoline markedly reduced caspase-3 activation and Hsp70 expression 24 h after the insult, and dose-dependently attenuated brain damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the context of the well-known excellent safety profile of citicoline, these data suggest that clinical evaluation of the efficacy of the drug in human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004045" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">birth asphyxia</z:e> may be warranted </plain></SENT>
