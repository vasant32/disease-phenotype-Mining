<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This is a retrospective review of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> carotid endarterectomies (CEA) (n=91) done from 1993 to 2002 at an inner-city hospital (Group I) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This group was compared to a randomly selected group of patients (n=445) treated at a private hospital (Group II) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The same high-volume surgeons performed CEAs at both hospitals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The majority of Group I patients (71.4%) were members of racial minority groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They were also more likely to be younger (p&lt;0.001), hypertensive (p&lt;0.03), diabetic (p&lt;0.001), and current smokers (p&lt;0.001); have contralateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (p=0.04); and present with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (p&lt;0.001) than Group II patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Despite this, the incidence of postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (2.2% vs 0.2%, p=0.08), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (1.1% vs 1.6%, NS), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (1.1% vs 0%, NS) was comparable between the 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Aggressive preoperative workup for occult <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> in Group I revealed an incidence of 25.9% (n=15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of these, 5 (33.3%) were found to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> severe enough to warrant intervention before CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In an inner-city population with increased medical comorbidities, more severe cerebrovascular disease, and relatively low volume of carotid surgery, the results of CEA were comparable to those in patients treated at a high-volume private hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The presence of high-volume surgeons, operating at the low-volume municipal hospital, may contribute to the low complication rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Finally, aggressive preoperative cardiac workup in this underserved population revealed a meaningful incidence of occult <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> requiring intervention before CEA </plain></SENT>
