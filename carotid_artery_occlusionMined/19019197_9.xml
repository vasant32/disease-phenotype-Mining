<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We exposed male Sprague-Dawley rats to 10 min of bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> + systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> (40-45 mmHg) or sham surgery, and used histopathological assessments for short-term survival animals (16 days) and both behavioral and histopathological assessments for long-term survival animals (270 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Analyses revealed significant long-term deficits in ischemic animals' learning, memory (T-maze, radial arm maze), working memory (radial arm maze), and reference memory (<z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water maze</z:mp>, radial arm maze) abilities that were not associated with a general <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Histological results showed significant increases in glial fibrillary acidic protein, neuron glia 2, OX-42 and ED-1 staining, as well as significant decreases in microtubule-associated protein 2 staining and cornu ammonis area 1 (CA1) cell counts 16 days post-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The pattern at 270 days was similar, but notably there was a persistent elevation of ED-1 staining, suggesting recent cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> as well as significant <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> of CA1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Whereas previous work has primarily reported transient changes in behavior after global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, this study describes disturbances in several different functional domains following CA1 cell loss at clinically relevant survival times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the histopathological outcome is suggestive of a spontaneous repopulation of CA1, but this was not sufficient to offset the behavioral impairments arising from the ischemic insult </plain></SENT>
