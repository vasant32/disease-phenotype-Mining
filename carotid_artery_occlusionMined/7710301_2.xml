<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At least a 1 min occlusion time was necessary to elevate the eicosanoid concentrations significantly over the basal levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Spontaneous tonic-clonic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> of about 20 sec duration induced an increase in <z:mp ids='MP_0002515'>prostaglandin D2</z:mp> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16978">LTC4</z:chebi>-like material comparable to the values found after a 2 min occlusion time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Following carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, the eicosanoid levels were found to be elevated in midbrain, hypothalamus, striatum, hippocampus and cortex, i.e., those brain areas dependent upon the blood supply from the carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, following spontaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002515'>prostaglandin D2</z:mp> concentrations were increased in the striatum, hippocampus and cortex only, and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16978">LTC4</z:chebi>-like material in the cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hippocampus, striatum and cortex are brain areas which participate in the generation and propagation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It appears, therefore, unlikely that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo>-induced eicosanoid synthesis is triggered off by a hypoxic event due to an impaired breathing caused by <z:mp ids='MP_0000947'>convulsions</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The regional pattern of the eicosanoid synthesis following the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> may rather depend on the intensity of the neuronal activity than on regional differences in the eicosanoid-synthesizing capacity </plain></SENT>
