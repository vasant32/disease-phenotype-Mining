<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We performed endarterectomy of the stenotic carotid in 44 such patients and followed them for mean 54 months (range 1-172 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Early mortality was 2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Life-table analysis shows that the incidence of a new <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was 0.6% per year, the survival rate was 78% after three years, and 70% after five years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We conclude that carotid endarterectomy can be safely performed in patients with contralateral internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and can significantly improve the long-term prognosis of these patients </plain></SENT>
