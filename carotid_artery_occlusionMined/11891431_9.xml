<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The rats were exposed to graded common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusions</z:mp> using a modification of the four-vessel model of Pulsinelli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>T2, diffusion, and cerebral blood volume were quantified with magnetic resonance imaging, and CBF was measured with the hydrogen clearance method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A transient common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> below the CBF value of approximately 20 mL x 100 g(-1) x min(-1) was needed to yield a T2 increase of 4.6 +/- 1.2 milliseconds (approximately 9% of cerebral T2) and 6.8 +/- 1.7 milliseconds (approximately 13% of cerebral T2) after 7 and 15 minutes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Increases in CBF of 103 +/- 75% and in cerebral blood volume of 29 +/- 20% were detected in the reperfusion phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These hemodynamic changes alone could account for only approximately one third of the T2 increase in luxury perfusion, suggesting that a substantial increase in blood oxygen saturation (resulting from reduced oxygen extraction by the brain) is needed to explain the magnetic resonance imaging observation </plain></SENT>
