<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Restoration of cerebrovascular reserve capacity (CVRC) depends on the recruitment and positive outward remodeling of preexistent collaterals (arteriogenesis) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>With this study, we provide functional evidence that granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) augments therapeutic arteriogenesis in two animal models of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1695782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral hypoperfusion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We identified an effective dosing regimen that improved CVRC and stimulated collateral growth, thereby improving the outcome after experimentally induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used two established animal models of (a) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1695782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral hypoperfusion</z:e> (mouse, common carotid artery ligation) and (b) cerebral arteriogenesis (rat, 3-vessel occlusion) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Following therapeutic dose determination, both models received either G-CSF, 40 μg/kg every other day, or vehicle for 1 week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Collateral vessel diameters were measured following latex angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cerebrovascular reserve capacities were assessed after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mice with left common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (CCAO) were additionally subjected to middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> volumes were assessed after triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Given the vital role of monocytes in arteriogenesis, we assessed (a) the influence of G-CSF on monocyte migration in vitro and (b) monocyte counts in the adventitial tissues of the growing collaterals in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CVRC was impaired in both animal models 1 week after induction of hypoperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>While G-CSF, 40 μg/kg every other day, significantly augmented cerebral arteriogenesis in the rat model, 50 or 150 μg/kg every day did not show any noticeable therapeutic impact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>G-CSF restored CVRC in mice (5 ± 2 to 12 ± 6%) and rats (3 ± 4 to 19 ± 12%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Vessel diameters changed accordingly: in rats, the diameters of posterior cerebral arteries (ipsilateral: 209 ± 7-271 ± 57 μm; contralateral: 208 ± 11-252 ± 28 μm) and in mice the diameter of anterior cerebral arteries (185 ± 15-222 ± 12 μm) significantly increased in the G-CSF groups compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> volume in mice (10 ± 2%) was diminished following CCAO (7 ± 4%) and G-CSF treatment (4 ± 2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>G-CSF significantly increased monocyte migration in vitro and perivascular monocyte numbers in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: G-CSF augments cerebral collateral artery growth, increases CVRC and protects from experimentally induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>When comparing three different dosing regimens, a relatively low dosage of G-CSF was most effective, indicating that the common side effects of this cytokine might be significantly reduced or possibly even avoided in this indication </plain></SENT>
