<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical presentation and management of internal carotid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0155760" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">artery rupture</z:e> after irradiation and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0029461" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">osteoradionecrosis</z:e> of the skull base </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: A retrospective review of the patients in an otorhinolaryngology-head and neck secondary and tertiary referral center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY: From January 1993 to December 1996, patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> from internal carotid artery as a complication of irradiation and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0029461" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">osteoradionecrosis</z:e> of skull base were reviewed and analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Four patients with internal carotid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0155760" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arterial rupture</z:e> were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Angiography was performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Embolization of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was performed on 2 patients and the remaining 2 patients underwent occlusion of their internal carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three of the 4 patients did not survive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The fourth is currently alive and well 18 months after embolization of 1 internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Skull base <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0029461" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">osteoradionecrosis</z:e> with <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> from internal carotid artery is a potentially fatal complication of irradiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Angiography was the mainstay of diagnosis with embolization of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and embolization or ligation of the internal carotid artery being the management options </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> is the definitive treatment provided cross circulation is adequate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>SIGNIFICANCE: The advantages and disadvantages of the treatment options are discussed and a management protocol is proposed </plain></SENT>
