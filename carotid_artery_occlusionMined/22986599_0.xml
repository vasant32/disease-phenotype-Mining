<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND:: Cholesterol granulomas (CG) of the petrous apex (PA) are rare, benign expanding lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Surgical treatment is recommended for patients with symptomatic disease; however, the optimal surgical procedure is still controversial due to high recurrence rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The main treatment strategy is divided into drainage and complete resection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE:: We advocate radical resection of the lesion by the middle fossa approach and reconstruction with a vascularized galeofascial flap </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS:: A 10-year retrospective case review of 17 patients undergoing surgical treatment of PA CGs between 2000 and 2010 was undertaken </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Operative outcomes and surgical complications were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, our operative method and the related <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> are described from cadaveric dissections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS:: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> but one patient was operated on via a middle fossa approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Using the middle fossa approach, radical resection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> PA CGs was achieved with obliteration of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cyst</z:mpath> cavity using a vascularized flap </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Important surrounding structures included the internal auditory canal, cochlea, petrous carotid artery, and abducens nerve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was one <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> caused by internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No other major complications or cranial nerve deficits occurred postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Clinical recurrence occurred in one patient (5.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION:: Our technique of radical resection and reconstruction with a vascularized flap has the advantage of being less invasive with less cosmetic deformity, and allows for preservation of cranial nerve function with a low recurrence rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Knowledge of the surgical <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> and the characteristics of CG is prudent, as important neurovascular structures may be exposed behind the CG wall due to bony <z:mpath ids='MPATH_580'>erosion</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
