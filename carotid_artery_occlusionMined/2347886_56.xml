<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to define the degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> required to diminish ischemic injury to CA1 hippocampal neurons following 5-min bilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in the gerbil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The temperature of the body and head was regulated in three groups of animals at 37.5, 35.5, or 32.5 degrees C during 5-min bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Upon recirculation, normothermia was restored in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals, and recovery was permitted for 1 week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ischemic injury to CA1 hippocampus was determined using three endpoints: histologic injury, ATP content, and adenylate kinase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Reduction of head temperature to 35.5 and 32.5 degrees C during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> diminished histologic injury and improved CA1 levels of ATP and adenylate kinase activity in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Indeed, 32.5 degrees C completely abolished ischemic injury to CA1 hippocampus, judging from each of the three endpoints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Reduction of head temperature to 32.5 degrees C delayed but did not prevent the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of ATP throughout the hippocampus during the 5-min ischemic insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that a decrease in head temperature of only 2 degrees C reduces the degree of CA1 injury in the gerbil model of 5-min bilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, it is imperative to maintain strict normothermia in pharmacologic studies of ischemic protection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Finally, administration of nicardipine to normothermic gerbils failed to diminish ischemic injury in the CA1 hippocampus </plain></SENT>
