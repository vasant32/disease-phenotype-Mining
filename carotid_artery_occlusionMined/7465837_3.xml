<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Correct diagnosis is aided by an awareness of the possibility of near occlusion of the ICA origin and by careful study of selective common carotid angiography with a long imaging sequence and subtraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Carotid endarterectomy is the operative procedure of choice, since there may be startling apparent increase in size of the arterial lumen distal to the surgical repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Many cases reported previously as internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> with successful endarterectomy may actually have been severe stenoses </plain></SENT>
