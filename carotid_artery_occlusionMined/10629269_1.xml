<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While the neurologic outcomes in this patient population have been described, the rate of disease progression measured by duplex examination and the eventual need for carotid endarterectomy has not been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, a computerized database of carotid duplex examinations was reviewed and clinical data were obtained from clinic records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From 9124 studies 117 patients were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty patients had previous carotid surgery on the patent side and were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of 87 patients 33 required carotid endarterectomy on the patent side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The rate of disease progression and/or the performance of a carotid endarterectomy by life-table analysis was 85.9% over 8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were 10 neurologic events during the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> and contralateral occlusion are at significant risk for disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Follow-up should be more frequent and of longer duration in this patient population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A significant number of patients with carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> will require a carotid endarterectomy of the patent contralateral carotid </plain></SENT>
