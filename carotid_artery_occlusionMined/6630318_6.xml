<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Unilateral cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-oligemia was produced in anesthetized mice using carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> combined with systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> (10% O2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the cerebral cortex ipsilateral to the carotid occlusion, ATP levels were depleted during a 30-min insult, but were restored to 64% of control during 60 min of recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment of animals with <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> diminished the restoration of ATP in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, when blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels exceeded 12-13 mM (225 mg/dl), ATP recovery was greatly impaired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neither <z:chebi fb="1" ids="28260">galactose</z:chebi> nor 3-O-methylglucose mimicked the detrimental effect of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, pretreatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37684">mannose</z:chebi>, which is readily metabolized by brain, impaired restoration of ATP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The impairment, therefore, appears to be specific for substrates of cerebral metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The ischemic accumulation of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> in the ipsilateral cortex was augmented by only 30% at blood <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> levels well above the threshold for ATP recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, unless recovery of energy metabolism is sensitive to small increments in brain <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi>, it is difficult to explain the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-induced energy failure on the basis of enhanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0003128'>lactic acidosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ipsilateral cerebral blood flow (CBF), measured with [<z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>]iodoantipyrine during <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> and recovery, was lower in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-pretreated than in saline-pretreated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, the poor correlation between CBF and ATP, measured in the same tissue samples at 15 min recovery, failed to substantiate that regeneration of ATP was flow-limited early in recovery </plain></SENT>
