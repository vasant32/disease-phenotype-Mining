<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At postnatal day 10, rats received either <z:chebi fb="71" ids="17303">morphine</z:chebi> (n = 7), <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7459">naloxone</z:chebi> (n = 7), or saline placebo (n = 15) after hypoxic-ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Survival (days), <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> and animal testing (negative geotaxis, surface righting, and rotarod) were compared between treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Lesion volume was delineated with magnetic resonance imaging at days 7 and 28-57 after injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Survival in rats treated with <z:chebi fb="71" ids="17303">morphine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7459">naloxone</z:chebi>, or saline was, respectively, 14, 29, and 73% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median number of days of survival after bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> with <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> treated with <z:chebi fb="71" ids="17303">morphine</z:chebi> was 4 (95% confidence interval 4 to 22), with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7459">naloxone</z:chebi> was 3 (95% confidence interval -1.4 to 21), and with placebo was 28 (95% confidence interval 18 to 28) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no statistically significant differences in magnetic resonance imaging-derived ischemic lesion volumes, <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp>, or behavioral testing measures between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="71" ids="17303">Morphine</z:chebi> was ineffective as a neuroprotectant in rat pups with severe hypoxic-ischemic injury and may have contributed to their decreased survival </plain></SENT>
