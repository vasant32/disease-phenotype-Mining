<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7983">pentobarbitone</z:chebi>-anaesthetised rabbits, unloading of the carotid sinus baroreceptors by a bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> elicited a reflex rise in arterial pressure which was markedly potentiated by pretreating the animals with the PAF receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> WEB 2086 [3-4-(2-chlorphenyl)-9-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-6H-thieno-3,2f-1,2,4-triazolo-4, 3 a-1,4-diazepin-2-yl-(4-morpholinyl)-I-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15347">propanone</z:chebi>; 2, 5 or 10 mg kg-1, i.v.] or BN 52021 (ginkgolide B; 0.1, 0.3 or 1.0 mg kg-1, i.v.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The increases in systemic vascular resistance induced by <z:chebi fb="15" ids="33569">noradrenaline</z:chebi> (30 micrograms kg-1, i.v.) or by the central activation of the sympathetic <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system with <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> (1 mg kg-1, intracerebroventricular) were also significantly potentiated in animals pretreated with WEB 2086 (5 mg kg-1, i.v.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, pretreatment with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35544">cyclooxygenase inhibitor</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi> (3 mg kg-1, i.v.) did not affect the haemodynamic actions of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="33569">noradrenaline</z:chebi>, thus excluding the possibility that prostacyclin may modulate the potentiating effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To further confirm that PAF is released during systemic vasoconstriction, the cardiovascular PAF receptors were desensitized by the daily administration of PAF (3 micrograms kg-1, i.v.) for seven days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This procedure significantly reduced the intensity and duration of the hypotensive response to a subsequent PAF injection (3 micrograms kg-1, i.v.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In desensitized animals, the hypertensive response to bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was potentiated to the same extent as in the animals treated with PAF receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of PAF biosynthesis by pretreatment of the animals with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50469">phospholipase A2 inhibitor</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8711">mepacrine</z:chebi> (5 mg kg-1, i.v.) also enhanced the increase in blood pressure elicited by carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that PAF is involved in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> but not basal modulation of vasomotor tone and, hence, arterial pressure, probably by a negative feedback mechanism triggered by important increases in the vascular tone </plain></SENT>
