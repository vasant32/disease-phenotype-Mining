<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To determine the utility of [<z:chebi fb="2" ids="36932">15O</z:chebi>]<z:chebi fb="2" ids="29375,33813">H2O</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography (PET) for the quantitative determination of cerebral blood flow in patients undergoing balloon test occlusion of the internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-two [<z:chebi fb="2" ids="36932">15O</z:chebi>]<z:chebi fb="2" ids="29375,33813">H2O</z:chebi> PET cerebral blood flow studies were completed on 20 patients for whom temporary or permanent occlusion of the internal carotid artery was being considered because of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376527" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">skull base tumor</z:e> or internal carotid artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In each study, cerebral blood flow was determined during temporary balloon internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, and again after deflation and removal of the balloon from the internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients were divided into three groups based on clinical and cerebral blood flow response to balloon test occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Studies were classified as group I when associated with no clinical symptomatology and with a cerebral blood flow decrease of less than 10 mL/100 g per minute (16 of 22 patients); as group II when there was no clinical symptomatology and cerebral blood flow fell to 25 to 35 mL/100 g per minute on the occluded side (5 of 22); and as group III when the patient was clinically unable to tolerate test occlusion and had a cerebral blood flow of less than 20 mL/100 g per minute on the occluded side (1 of 22) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neurologic sequelae developed in none of the eight group I patients later undergoing permanent internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Cerebral infarction</z:e> developed subsequently in the one group II patient who underwent internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: During internal carotid artery balloon test occlusion, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36932">[15O]</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29375,33813">H2O</z:chebi> PET determination of cerebral blood flow allows rapid quantitative determination of cerebral blood flow throughout the entire brain, predicting the adequacy of collateral flow after permanent occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were able to tolerate the [<z:chebi fb="2" ids="36932">15O</z:chebi>]<z:chebi fb="2" ids="29375,33813">H2O</z:chebi> PET cerebral blood flow determination, and there were no complications of the procedure </plain></SENT>
