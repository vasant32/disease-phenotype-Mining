<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The peripheral cardiovascular effects of tabernanthine <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15193,50562">tartrate</z:chebi> have been studied in anaesthetized rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our results confirm that the bradycardic effect of tabernanthine is not inhibited by vagotomy, <z:chebi fb="28" ids="16684">atropine</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8499">propranolol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, bivagotomy, <z:chebi fb="28" ids="16684">atropine</z:chebi> treatment, as well as carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, potentiate the bradycardic effect of tabernanthine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The same is true for its hypotensive action and can be explained by the suppression of a compensatory mechanism involving the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system, the parasympathetic system and/or a baroreflex mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, domperidone and sulpiride, two dopaminolytic drugs, are able to potentiate the decrease in heart rate produced by tabernanthine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In pithed rat, tabernanthine 1 mg/kg, potentiates the increases in systolic blood pressure produced either by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">serotonine</z:chebi>; conversely the systolic blood pressure responses to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> are significantly inhibited by tabernanthine 1 mg/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, tabernanthine appears to possess a complex cardiovascular mechanism of action, depending probably on a simultaneous stimulation of beta 2-vascular adrenoceptors and alteration of cellular movements of calcium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Part of the direct bradycardic effect, as well as the inhibition of the pressor responses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> could be explained by a calcium <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> action of the alcaloid </plain></SENT>
