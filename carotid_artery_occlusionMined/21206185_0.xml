<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Carotid ultrasonography showed that the right common carotid artery (CCA) was occluded up to just proximal to the carotid bifurcation, and the patent external carotid artery showed retrograde flow to the patent internal carotid artery via the carotid bifurcation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The Doppler waveform pattern of the external carotid artery showed high end-diastolic flow velocity and low pulsatility index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis was Riles type 1A CCA occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Digital subtraction angiography and <z:chebi fb="60" ids="24859">iodine</z:chebi>-123 N-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30353">isopropyl</z:chebi>-p-iodoamphetamine single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography were performed to confirm the collateral circulation and adequate intracranial hemodynamic sufficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nonsurgical treatment with antiplatelet therapy was performed for the CCA occlusion </plain></SENT>
