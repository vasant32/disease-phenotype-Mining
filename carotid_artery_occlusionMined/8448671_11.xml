<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, gerbils were subjected to a 5-min bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During surgery, skull and body temperatures were maintained with a heated water blanket and a homeothermic blanket unit, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rectal, skull and brain temperatures were monitored throughout <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and for up to 3 h in the post-ischemic period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intra-ischemic brain temperature fell by approximately 1.5 degrees C even though skull and rectal temperatures remained at <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Since brain temperature modulates the extent of ischemic injury it may not be sufficient to rely on skull and/or rectal temperature readings, especially during periods of anesthesia </plain></SENT>
