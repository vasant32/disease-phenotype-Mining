<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A pre-resection extracranial-intracranial bypass may be necessary to reduce the risk of neurologic morbidity, in particular when carotid artery resection is planned for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> involving the skull base </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Carotid artery resection is generally considered the only curative treatment for patients with advanced head and neck <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> involving the carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PET can be used during temporary occlusion of the internal carotid artery to assess the safety of the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The aims of this paper were to clarify the risk of carotid artery resection and the benefit of extracranial-intracranial bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twelve patients diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278996" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">head and neck cancer</z:e> adherent to the carotid artery and in proximity to the skull base who had shown good hemispheric collateral blood flow by means of PET underwent carotid artery resection without preoperative bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 12 patients who underwent carotid artery resection without reconstruction, 10 suffered no serious neurologic complications; however, 2 suffered <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarctions</z:e> intraoperatively </plain></SENT>
