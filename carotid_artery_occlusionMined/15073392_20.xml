<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Neurogenesis has been observed in the dentate gyrus of the adult hippocampus; however, the mechanisms involved in this process are still only partly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we visualized the proliferation, migration, and differentiation of neuronal progenitor cells in the dentate gyrus induced by ischemic stress using improved retroviral vector </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Improved retroviral vector expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) as a transgene was injected into the dentate gyrus of adult Mongolian gerbils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After 48 hours, transient global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (TGI) was induced by bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> for 5 minutes using <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> clips </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The morphological and immunohistological features of newly-generated cells in the dentate gyrus were analyzed at various times thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At 48 hours after <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> injection, almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> EGFP-positive dividing cells were found in the subgranule layer (SGL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These cells proliferated and migrated to the granule cell layer (GCL), expressing the developing neuronal markers <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26206">polysialic acid</z:chebi> and doublecortin, and differentiated to neuronal nuclei-positive or calbindin-positive mature granule cells at 30 days after TGI or sham-operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The number of GFP-positive cells in the GCL was significantly higher (P&lt;0.05) in the ischemic animals at 30 days than in sham-operated gerbils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We saw neurogenesis in the adult dentate gyrus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we showed that ischemic stress promoted the proliferation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> development of neurons at this site </plain></SENT>
