<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effect of mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> on the appearance of AD and subsequent brain injury following profound <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> is studied to evaluate the protective mechanism of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> against severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">transient ischemia</z:e> by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> (50-20 mmHg) and bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (BCA-O) for 20 min in normothermia and 30 min in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The temperature of body and temporal muscles was maintained at 37.5 degrees C and 36.5 degrees C in normothermia and 33.0 degrees C and 31.0 degrees C in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recording of the DC potential shift and electrocorticogram and monitoring of the cortical blood flow (CoBF) with a laser Doppler flowmeter were done epidurally on the right parietal cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The right parietal cortex pathology was examined 24 h after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in normothermia and after 30 days in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>AD appeared in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> seven normothermic rats with a fall in the CoBF to 9%-10% of the control flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, in spite of CoBF reduction to 8%-9% of the control flow, it did not appear in five hypothermic rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Intra-ischemic CoBF was not statistically different between these two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>AD appeared with the CoBF decreasing to 4%-5% of the control flow in seven hypothermic rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Intra-ischemic CoBF in hypothermic rats exhibiting AD was significantly lower than the other two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The interval between BCA-O and the appearance of AD in hypothermic rats was 5.1 +/- 0.3 min (mean +/- SE), which was significantly longer than the 2.2 +/- 0.5 min observed in normothermia (p &lt; 0.0005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Of seven normothermic rats exhibiting AD, two died within 24 h and four revealed massive neuronal injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Of seven hypothermic rats with AD, four died between day 2 and day 13, and one revealed diffuse <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>However, no severe ischemic injury or ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> five hypothermic rats without AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The incidence of severe neuronal injury or ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was significantly lower in hypothermic rats without AD compared with normothermic rats with AD (p &lt; 0.02) or hypothermic rats with AD (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Although mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> delays AD, it is suggested that raising the cerebral blood flow threshold for AD appearance has a key role in the hypothermic protection of a severely ischemic area such as the ischemic core </plain></SENT>
