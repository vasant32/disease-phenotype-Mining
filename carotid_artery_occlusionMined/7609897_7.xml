<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Male spontaneously hypertensive rats were subjected to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> for 60 min by bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, and recirculated for 120 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Isradipine (0.25 mg/kg n = 6) or vehicle (n = 6) was administered subcutaneously at 20 min before <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the striatum, cerebral blood flow was determined by the hydrogen clearance method and concentrations of extracellular <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> were measured by in vivo brain dialysis technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Extracellular <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> in the vehicle-treated group increased by 180-fold from the basal level, and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> by 24-fold during <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Isradipine significantly attenuated the ischemic release of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> to 33-34% (P &lt; 0.05) of the vehicle group, while it did not affect <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that the release mechanism of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> during <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> may be different, especially in the dependence on the L-type calcium channels </plain></SENT>
