<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of bretylium on changes in vulnerability to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001663'>ventricular fibrillation</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e>) and refractoriness which occur during <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Right ventricular <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> thresholds and effective refractory periods (ERP) at six left ventricular sites were measured before and serially after left anterior descending <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151814" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary occlusion</z:e> in chloralose-anesthetized cats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In eight untreated animals, there was a decrease in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> thresholds of 73% (p less than 0.01) immediately after occlusion and dispersion of refractoriness (DR) (maximum difference in ERP between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and ischemic left ventricular sites) increased from 18 +/- 4 to 50 +/- 6 msec (p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five of eight animals manifested spontaneous <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> within the first minutes of occlusion but none had nonsustained <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment with bretylium (10 to 20 mg/kg intravenously) increased resting ERP from 181 +/- 9 to 201 +/- 9 msec (p less than 0.05) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> threshold from 32 +/- 5 to 85 +/- 7 mA (p less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Bretylium also prevented spontaneous <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> eight animals and abolished occlusion-related changes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> and DR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fourteen animals were similarly studied using clofilium, a bretylium congener which is devoid of sympatholytic effect (no effect on blood pressure response to bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Clofilium increased resting ERP and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> thresholds at both low (0.5 mg/kg intravenously) and high doses (5 mg/kg intravenously) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>High-but not low-dose clofilium blunted the fall in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">VF</z:e> threshold after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151814" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary occlusion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
