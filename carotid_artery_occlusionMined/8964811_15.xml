<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We then evaluated the extent of damage and its recovery for up to 21 days using nine behavioral tests aimed at analyzing strength, coordination, and bilateral asymmetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Also using a graded bioassay that employs a curve-fitting computer program (ALLFIT) to correlate duration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> with degree of behavioral dysfunction, we calculated the average of maximal behavioral dysfunction and duration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> required to produce half-maximal behavioral dysfunction and compared these values in untreated controls with analogous values obtained from animals treated with <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>-1102 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three behavioral tests, forearm flex, tape (somatosensory neutralization), and foot-fault placing, were each separately and combined able to distinguish between the degrees of damage produced by increasing durations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The behavioral abnormalities assessed using the tape test were reversible within a week, whereas those using forearm flex or foot-fault tests persisted for at least 21 days </plain></SENT>
