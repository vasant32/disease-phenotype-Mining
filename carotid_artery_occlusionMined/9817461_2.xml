<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Whereas multiple <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> may be found in 20% of patients in whom one <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> is discovered, the identification of five vertebrobasilar <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> is distinctly rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We described such a case treated by surgical and endovascular method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE DESCRIPTION: A case of multiple <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> treated with combined surgical clipping and intravascular surgery is described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five separate posterior circulation <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> and bilateral internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> were identified in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were treated surgically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Access to the fourth <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was deemed difficult because of its location and because of the previously placed surgical clips; this <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was treated by endovascular approaches that provided optimum therapy in this unusual multiple <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We have described an unusual case of multiple posterior circulation <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> in the setting of bilateral internal carotid occlusions, treated by a combination of surgical and endovascular therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We will be able to provide safer treatment for such difficult cases in the future </plain></SENT>
