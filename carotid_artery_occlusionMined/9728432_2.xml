<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At our institution, the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> is based on duplex scanning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In cases of occlusion, duplex is not reliable, and angiography is performed, thereby increasing morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We tried to determine whether a combination of duplex scanning and CT angiography (CTA) can replace angiography in the diagnosis of carotid occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Prospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: From 1995 to 1997, 148 patients were diagnosed as having carotid occlusion by duplex scanning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CTA was performed on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Forty-four patients underwent angiography and 10 patients were surgically explored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both procedures were considered "gold standard" for the diagnosis of occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Arteries found to be occluded by both CTA and duplex scan were confirmed as occluded by angiography or operation in 95% of the cases (42/44) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Arteries found to be occluded by duplex but patent by CTA were confirmed as patent in 100% of cases (10/10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CTA has a significantly higher positive predicting value for diagnosing occlusion than duplex scan (95% vs. 77%, p value &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Combination of duplex scanning and CTA is safe and accurate in the diagnosis of carotid occlusion and can replace angiography in most cases, thereby reducing morbidity </plain></SENT>
