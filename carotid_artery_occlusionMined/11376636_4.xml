<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventeen patients with unilateral ICA occlusion had repeated echo-Doppler examinations during 1 year and were compared to 12 volunteers with control non-occluded common carotid arteries (CCA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The cause of ICA occlusion was <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> in nine patients, dissection in five, and undetermined in three </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results showed a significant reduction in ID on the occluded side (5.15 +/- 0.30 mm) compared with the non-occluded side (5.96 +/- 0.20 mm, P &lt; 0.05) and with control arteries (5.55 +/- 0.10, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A significant reduction in blood flow was observed on the occluded side (404 +/- 58 ml/min) compared with the non-occluded side (703 +/- 51 ml/min, P &lt; 0.0001) and with controls (567 +/- 27 ml/min, P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Wall cross-sectional area was found to be positively correlated to blood flow (r = 0.35, P &lt; 0.01), without any significant difference in mean CSA between both sides </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, wall shear stress values were identical on both sides whatever the cause of ICA occlusion, and did not differ from those in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that in humans, the internal diameter of the common carotid artery decreases in response to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> decrease in blood flow, in order to maintain a constant wall shear stress even in pathological arteries </plain></SENT>
