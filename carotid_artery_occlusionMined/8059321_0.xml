<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 27-year-old man was admitted to our institution with the sudden development of right <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001260'>dysarthria</z:hpo> beginning an hour after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms on August 9, 1992 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patient was found on admission to have right <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> (2/5), hemihypesthesia, hemianopia, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001260'>dysarthria</z:hpo>; he had transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No abnormalities were detected on computed tomography (CT) scans, and cerebral blood flow studies undertaken following conventional CT scans revealed no low flow regions in the left cerebral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>But cerebral angiography disclosed an occlusion of the left internal carotid artery with well-developed cross-circulation via the anterior communicating artery and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> lodged at the level of the anterior choroidal artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Superselective fibrinolysis using Tracker-18 and 420,000 units of urokinase resulting in complete recanalization of the left anterior choroidal artery without distal migration of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immediately after the procedure, his neurologic disturbance underwent complete resolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In summary, fibrinolysis could be performed but limited to anterior choroidal artery in a case with an occlusion of the internal carotid artery with well-developed cross-flow via the anterior communicating artery; the patient's neurologic condition may deteriorate suddenly if fibrinolysis is incomplete and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_110'>embolus</z:mpath> migrates to the internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
