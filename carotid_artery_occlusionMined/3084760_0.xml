<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In chloralose-anesthetized dogs with the left circumflex coronary artery perfused at constant flow, the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi> or naproxen on coronary and systemic responses to sympathetic and parasympathetic stimulation were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sympathetic stimulation was evoked either by 1-min carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> or by <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28918">epinephrine</z:chebi> (5 micrograms) or <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> (5 micrograms) intracoronary administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Reflex or direct parasympathetic stimulation was produced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7805">ouabain</z:chebi> (40 micrograms) or <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> (2.5 micrograms) injection, respectively, in the perfused coronary artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi> or naproxen reduced the integrated areas of coronary vasodilatation induced by <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28918">epinephrine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The extent of this reduction was dose-dependent with both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="28918">epinephrine</z:chebi>: r = 0.774, n = 35, P less than .001; <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi>: r = 0.766, n = 35, P less than .001; <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi>: r = 0.799, n = 35, P less than .001) up to 1.5 and 7 mg/kg, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further increase in dosage of both <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> synthesis inhibitors failed to induce further reduction of integrated areas of coronary vasodilatation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the maximum fall in coronary perfusion pressure, induced by both <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamines</z:chebi>, remained unmodified after inhibition of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> synthesis, whereas a faster return of the perfusion pressure to base line was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The extent of cyclooxygenase activity inhibition induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi> or naproxen, assessed through the radioimmunoassay of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28728">thromboxane B2</z:chebi>, showed a consistent dose-dependent increase until complete inhibition was attained with 1.5 mg/kg of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi> and 7 mg/kg of naproxen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant change in the coronary and systemic hemodynamic response induced by carotid occlusion and by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7805">ouabain</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> intracoronary administration was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, complete cyclooxygenase inhibition, induced by either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi> or naproxen, was able to reduce the coronary vasodilatation induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoproterenol</z:chebi> (5 micrograms) intracoronary injection but failed to modify the coronary vasoconstriction elicited by both <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28918">epinephrine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8499">propranolol</z:chebi>-treated dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that the <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> system is involved in the coronary vasodilatation induced by humoral sympathetic stimulation, whereas coronary hemodynamic responses to both neural sympathetic or parasympathetic stimulation are not influenced by the administration of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> synthesis inhibitors </plain></SENT>
