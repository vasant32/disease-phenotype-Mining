<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The contribution of <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> to the pathogenesis of ischemic lesions in the neonate is still uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study described the chronological sequence of inflammatory changes that follow <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> with reperfusion in the neonatal P7 rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: P7 rats underwent left middle cerebral artery electrocoagulation associated with 1-hour left common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The spatiotemporal pattern of cellular responses was characterized immunocytochemically with the use of antibodies against rat endogenous immunoglobulins to visualize the area of the breakdown of the blood-brain barrier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Infiltration of neutrophils and T lymphocytes was demonstrated by antibodies against myeloperoxidase and a pan-T cell marker, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Antibodies ED1 and OX-42 were applied to identify microglial cells and macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The response of astrocytes was shown with antibodies against glial fibrillary acidic protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cell survival was assessed by Bcl-2 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was demonstrated by DNA fragmentation with the use of the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi> nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay and Bax immunodetection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Endogenous immunoglobulin extravasation through the blood-brain barrier occurred at 2 hours of recirculation and persisted until 1 month after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Neutrophil infiltration began at 24 hours and peaked at 72 to 96 hours (30+/-3.4 neutrophils per 0.3 mm(2); P&lt;0.0001), then disappeared at 14 days after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>T cells were observed between 24 and 96 hours of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Resident microglia-macrophages exhibited morphological remnants and expressed the cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> inhibitor Bcl-2 at 24 hours of recirculation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>They became numerous within the next 48 hours and peaked at 7 days after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Phenotypic changes of resident astrocytes were apparent at 24 hours, and they proliferated between 48 hours and 7 days after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Progressively inflammatory cells showed DNA fragmentation and the cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> activator Bax expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Cell elimination continued until there was a complete disappearance of the frontoparietal cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that perinatal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> with reperfusion triggers <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory responses</z:mp> with granulocytic cell infiltration, which may be involved in accelerating the destructive processes </plain></SENT>
