<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Normoglycemic and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9288">streptozotocin</z:chebi> (STZ)-diabetic rats were subjected to bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> for 30 min followed by reperfusion for 60 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rats had either been treated with dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) for 7, 14, or 21 days (2 or 4 mg/day per rat) or left untreated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Oxidative state, <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> balance, and membrane integrity were evaluated in isolated synaptosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IR increased the levels of reactive species and worsened the synaptic function, affecting membrane Na/K-ATPase activity and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase release in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The oxidative imbalance was much severer when transient IR was induced in STZ-diabetic rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DHEA treatment restored <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30492">H2O2</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29191">hydroxyl radical</z:chebi>, and reactive oxygen species to close to control levels in normoglycemic rats and significantly reduced the level of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> reactive species in STZ-diabetic rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, DHEA treatment counteracted the detrimental effect of IR on membrane integrity and function: the increase of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase release and the drop in Na/K-ATPase activity were significantly prevented in both normoglycemic and STZ-diabetic rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results confirm that DHEA, an adrenal steroid that is synthesized de novo by brain neurons and astrocytes, possesses a multitargeted <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>They also show that DHEA treatment is effective in preventing both derangement of the oxidative state and neuronal damage induced by IR in experimental <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
