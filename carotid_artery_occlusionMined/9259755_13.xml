<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Flow measurements in the collateral arteries of patients with internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusions may be important to estimate the risk of future <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Quantitative flow measurements in cerebropetal vessels can be reliably assessed by means of magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty-four patients with transient or minor ischemic neurological deficits and an angiographically proven ICA occlusion and 16 control subjects underwent two-dimensional phase-contrast MRA quantitative flow measurements through the common carotid arteries, basilar artery, ICAs, and middle cerebral arteries (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with a unilateral ICA occlusion and a 0% to 69% stenosis of the contralateral ICA had increased flow in the contralateral ICA (P &lt; .005) and in the basilar artery (P &lt; .005) compared with control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Even patients with a 70% to 99% stenosis contralateral to the ICA occlusion had increased flow in the ICA (P &lt; .05) as well as increased flow in the basilar artery (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Total cerebropetal flow was not significantly different between these patients and control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with bilateral ICA occlusions had an increased flow in the basilar artery (P &lt; .001), while the total cerebropetal flow was less than in control subjects (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, flow was decreased in the ipsilateral <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> (P &lt; .001) and in the contralateral <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The contralateral ICA is the main supplying artery in patients with an ICA occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Total cerebropetal flow decreases only when both ICAs are occluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In patients with symptomatic ICA occlusions, an open contralateral ICA is probably important to retain the cerebral blood flow within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> limits </plain></SENT>
