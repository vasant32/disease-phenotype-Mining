<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECT: Recently, several studies have demonstrated that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> has a beneficial effect on clinical outcome; however, it is difficult to determine the appropriate rewarming conditions in clinical use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present study was to examine the influence of rewarming conditions in gerbils with transient forebrain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Ischemia</z:e> was induced in the gerbils by a 5-minute bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, after which the animals were immediately subjected to moderate or deep <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> (30.5 degrees C for 4 hours) the animals were rewarmed over standard, fast, or slow time periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After deep <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> (24 degrees C for 2 hours) the animals were rewarmed in a standard, fast, slow, or stepwise manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow (CBF), extracellular <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> were monitored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hippocampal CA I cell damage was assessed 7 days after induction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In animals treated with moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo>, the rewarming rate had no influence on the number of surviving neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, fast rewarming from deep <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> (to 37 degrees C for 30 minutes) failed to provide the neuroprotective effect of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, this group showed a poor recovery of CBF (p &lt; 0.01) and, consequently, an increase in extracellular <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> (p &lt; 0.01) and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> (p &lt; 0.01) in the hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicate a transient uncoupling of CBF and cerebral metabolism during fast rewarming from deep <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo>, whereas slow and stepwise rewarming periods were found to be useful for protection against uncoupling of CBF and cerebral metabolism during rewarming </plain></SENT>
