<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Little is known about the neuroprotective action of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29014">cordycepin</z:chebi> as well as its molecular mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29014">cordycepin</z:chebi> was investigated for its neuroprotective potential in mice with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> following 15 min of the bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and 4h of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29014">cordycepin</z:chebi> was also studied in mice brain slices treated with oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> deprivation (OGD) injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results showed that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29014">cordycepin</z:chebi> was able to prevent postischemic <z:mp ids='MP_0002229'>neuronal degeneration</z:mp> and brain slice injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Excitatory amino acids such as <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi> in brain homogenized supernatant, which were increased in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion group, were detected by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results showed that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29014">cordycepin</z:chebi> was able to decrease the extracellular level of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi> significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29014">cordycepin</z:chebi> was able to increase the activity of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (SOD) and decrease the level of malondialdehyde (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>), ameliorating the extent of oxidation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, matrix metalloproteinase-3(MMP-3), a key enzyme involved in inflammatory reactions, was markedly increased after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> reperfusion, whereas <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29014">cordycepin</z:chebi> was able to inhibit its expression obviously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our in vivo and in vitro study showed that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29014">cordycepin</z:chebi> was able to exert a potent neuroprotective function after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion </plain></SENT>
