<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Human umbilical cord blood (HUCB) is a potential source of cellular therapy in perinatology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the effects of HUCB cells on spatial memory, motor performance, and brain morphologic changes in neonate rats submitted to HI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seven-day-old rats underwent right carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> followed by exposure to 8% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi> inhalation for 2 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four hours after HI, rats received either saline solution or HUCB cells i.v </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After 3 wk, rats were assessed using a <z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris Water Maze</z:mp> and four motor tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, rats were killed for histologic, immunohistochemical, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>HI rats showed significant spatial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0233794" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">memory deficits</z:e> and a volumetric decrease in the hemisphere ipsilateral to <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These deficits and decreases were not significantly attenuated by the injection of HUCB cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, immunofluorescence and PCR analysis revealed few HUCB cells located in rat brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Intravenous administration of HUCB cells requires optimization to achieve improved therapeutic outcomes in neonatal hypoxic-ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
