<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>junD <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was induced in the hippocampus within 2 h of reperfusion and was strong in the dentate gyrus but weak in the CA3 and CA1 subregions </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We suggest that the early induction in junD expression in the dentate gyrus and in the hypothermic CA3 region is a protective reaction to the ischemic stress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The marked increase in resistant brain areas could be due to the preserved intracellular signaling pathways and a subsequent maintenance of protein synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The late continuous increase, unique to the vulnerable normothermic CA1 region, suggests that junD participates in a transcriptional process that may be important for delayed neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in the hippocampus following transient forebrain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
