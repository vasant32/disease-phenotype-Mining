<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this model it is possible to induce two levels of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in the same animal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, monitoring the brain in vivo in real-time will provide meaningful information regarding the development of ischemic injury as well as the follow-up during the recirculation period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aims of the study were as follows: (1) To elucidate the mechanism behind the development of ischemic depolarization under unilateral and bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>(2) To exclude the possibility that removal of the dura mater will affect the results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>(3) To correlate the kinetics of the recovery processes to the level of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We tested the correlation between energy <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> level (evaluated by intramitochondrial <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16908">NADH</z:chebi> redox state) and the development of ischemic depolarization (ID) and vasospasm (evaluated by extracellular K+, DC potential and 366 nm reflectance changes, respectively) under partial and complete <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (induced by unilateral or bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>) using the multiparametric monitoring system (MPA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 12 out of 32 gerbils monitored by the MPA, the dura mater remained intact, while in the other 20, it was removed very gently before connecting the MPA to the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two types of responses to unilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> were recorded and the gerbils were divided into groups according to the development of the ID </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In a third group of 5 gerbils we tested the effect of 1-5 min of bilateral occlusion on the various parameters monitored.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
