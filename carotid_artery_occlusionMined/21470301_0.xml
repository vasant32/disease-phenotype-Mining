<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The present study assessed the in vivo rat pial microvascular responses induced by <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> during brain hypoperfusion and reperfusion (RE) injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Pial microcirculation of male Wistar rats was visualized by fluorescence microscopy through a closed cranial window </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hypoperfusion was induced by bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (BCCAO, 30 min); thereafter, pial microcirculation was observed for 60 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Arteriolar diameter, permeability increase, leukocyte <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> to venular walls, perfused capillary length (<z:chebi fb="43" ids="53200">PCL</z:chebi>), and capillary red blood cell velocity (V(RBC) ) were investigated by computerized methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">Melatonin</z:chebi> (0.5, 1, 2 mg/kg b.w.) was intravenously administered 10 min before BCCAO and at the beginning of RE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pial arterioles were classified in five orders according to diameter, length, and branchings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In control group, BCCAO caused decrease in order 2 arteriole diameter (by 17.5 ± 3.0% of baseline) that was reduced by 11.8 ± 1.2% of baseline at the end of RE, accompanied by marked leakage and leukocyte <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="43" ids="53200">PCL</z:chebi> and capillary V(RBC) decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At the end of BCCAO, <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> highest dosage caused order 2 arteriole diameter reduction by 4.6 ± 2.0% of baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At RE, <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> at the lower dosages caused different arteriolar responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The highest dosage caused dilation in order 2 arteriole by 8.0 ± 1.5% of baseline, preventing leakage and leukocyte <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e>, while <z:chebi fb="43" ids="53200">PCL</z:chebi> and V(RBC) increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Luzindole (4 mg/kg b.w.) prior to <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> caused order 2 arteriole constriction by 12.0 ± 1.5% of baseline at RE, while leakage, leukocyte <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e>, <z:chebi fb="43" ids="53200">PCL</z:chebi> and V(RBC) were not affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="8364">Prazosin</z:chebi> (1 mg/kg b.w.) prior to <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> did not significantly change <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi>'s effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> caused different responses during hypoperfusion and RE, modulating pial arteriolar tone likely by MT1 and MT2 <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16796">melatonin</z:chebi> receptors while preventing blood-brain barrier changes through its free radical scavenging action </plain></SENT>
