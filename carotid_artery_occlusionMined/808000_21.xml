<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Anesthesia was induced with either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7983">pentobarbital</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi> and maintained for two to three hours after vessel occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> studies, the effect of regional <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> on cerebral concentrations of ATP, phosphocreatine, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> was determined at the end of this period in gerbils, cats, and squirrel monkeys </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> studies, the degree of neurological deficit and size of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> were determined 48 hours after a two-hour to three-hour period of vessel occlusion in cats and squirrel monkeys and permanent occlusion in dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In gerbils, dogs, and cats, there were no differences in the metabolis, functional, or pathological effects of anesthesia with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7983">pentobarbital</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, in the squirrel monkey, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> studies the metabolic alterations were significantly less with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7983">pentobarbital</z:chebi>, and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> studies the frequency and magnitude of functional deficits and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> were significantly less </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7983">pentobarbital</z:chebi> does provide a degree of protection during regional <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> but that such effects are only consistently demonstrable in primates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In nonprimates, we assume that variability in the collateral circulation renders demonstration of significant differences difficult or impossible </plain></SENT>
