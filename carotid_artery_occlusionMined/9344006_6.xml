<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While antithrombotic or antiplatelet therapy may prevent distal embolism, there is no effective program for plaque stabilization preventing progression of atherosclerotic stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In patients with isolated circulations (single vertebral with absent posterior communicating arteries, single carotid with contralateral internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, or single carotid with an absent anterior communicating artery), occlusion of the stenotic vessel may produce a low flow-mediated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients with atherosclerotic intracranial stenoses were treated by balloon angioplasty after medical therapy with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> failed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treated territories included the distal internal carotid, proximal middle cerebral, distal vertebral, and basilar arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Dilation was successful in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> vessels, with residual stenoses averaging less than 30% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two complications included one paramedian pontine <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and a single vessel rupture that proved fatal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no recurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> and no restenosis at the angioplasty site over a follow-up period of more than 24 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In this small series, balloon angioplasty of intracranial vessels provided a therapeutic option for secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> prevention in highly selected patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further studies will be necessary to establish the efficacy and safety of endovascular treatment in larger series </plain></SENT>
