<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Extracranial-to-intracranial (EC-IC) bypass surgery for the prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in patients with symptomatic carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> has nearly ended after a randomized trial showed no benefit of the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although an EC-IC bypass might benefit patients with compromised cerebrovascular hemodynamics, the randomized trial did not differentiate patients with hemodynamic from embolic etiologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, subsequent investigators have identified a subgroup of patients at increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk from hemodynamic compromise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We examined the subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate of 42 patients with symptomatic carotid occlusion at high risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> identified as having a baseline cerebral blood flow (CBF)&lt;45 mL/100 g/min and a &gt;5% CBF reduction in one vascular territory after a vasodilatory challenge from 1 g of intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> on stable <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi>-computed tomography (CT) CBF imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty patients (group 1) treated medically were a subgroup with carotid occlusion from our long-term natural history study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During a median follow-up of 12 months, 9 patients (30%) had a new <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> within a median of 5 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients (group 2) had recurrent, disabling cerebral ischemic symptoms, with 8 progressing to mild fixed neurological deficits from deep white matter infarction identified on CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> were treated with superficial temporal artery to distal middle cerebral artery (STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) bypass with restoration of cerebrovascular reserve postoperatively; none had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> during the 18-month minimum follow-up (P=.041) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Perioperative morbidity included subendocardial infarction in one and a small, asymptomatic left frontal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> in another patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Early postoperative and delayed <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi>/CT CBF studies obtained a median of 5 months postoperatively showed maintenance of cerebrovascular reserve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> bypass surgery can restore cerebrovascular reserve in high-risk patients with symptomatic internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This was achieved with minimal perioperative complications, resulting in a subsequent reduction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We suggest that the efficacy of STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> bypass surgery for symptomatic carotid occlusion be re-examined prospectively using hemodynamic selection criteria </plain></SENT>
