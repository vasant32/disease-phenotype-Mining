<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to define the magnitude and molecular determinants of the platelet- and leukocyte-endothelial cell adhesive interactions induced by I/R in the mouse brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was induced for 1 hour in C57BL/6 mice, followed by either 40 minutes or 4 hours of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fluorescent platelets were administered intravenously, and the frontal brain surface was observed with intravital fluorescence microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Leukocyte-endothelial cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> was monitored with the use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52672">rhodamine-6G</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Ischemia</z:e> followed by 40 minutes of reperfusion resulted in the rolling (125.1+/-23.6/mm2) and firm <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> (109.5+/-25.8/mm2) of leukocytes but not platelets in venules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, with 4 hours of reperfusion, rolling (138.8+/-24.6/mm2) and firm <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> (153.7+/-22.3/mm2) of platelets were detected, and this was accompanied by a more intense recruitment of rolling (374.5+/-54.6/mm2) and adherent (445.2+/-57.1/mm2) leukocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In mice deficient in either P-selectin (P-selectin-/-) or intercellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule-1 (ICAM-1) (ICAM-1-/-), the I/R-induced platelet-endothelial cell (by 80% and 60%, respectively) and leukocyte-endothelial cell (by 84% and 78%, respectively) interactions were significantly blunted compared with those of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that I/R promotes the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> of both platelets and leukocytes in cerebral venules, with the accumulation of adherent leukocytes preceding the recruitment of platelets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both P-selectin and ICAM-1 contribute to the inflammatory and prothrombogenic state induced by cerebral I/R </plain></SENT>
