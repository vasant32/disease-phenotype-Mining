<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was designed to determine whether <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> 5-(3'-pyridinylmethyl)<z:chebi fb="0" ids="36790">benzofuran</z:chebi>-2-carboxylate (U-63557A), a selective <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26995">thromboxane</z:chebi> synthetase inhibitor, could potentiate the effects of <z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi> on CBF in ischemic gerbils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Ischemia</z:e> was produced by bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> for 15 minutes followed by reperfusion for 2 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immediately after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, gerbils were given either an intravenous bolus of 0.167 mg of <z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi> followed by a continuous infusion of <z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi> at 1 mg/hr, or U-63557A (10 mg/kg intraperitoneally), or U-63557A and <z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi>, or a saline infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Regional CBF was measured by the hydrogen clearance method, and brain water by the specific gravity technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Brain <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandins</z:chebi> were measured by radioimmunoassay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Preischemic CBF's ranged from 27.4 to 29.5 ml/100 gm/min for the four animal groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and 2 hours of reperfusion, CBF in the saline-infused gerbils was significantly decreased to 19.2 ml/100 gm/min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Gerbils treated with either <z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi> or U-63557A alone had a CBF of 23.7 and 21.6 ml/100 gm/min, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Postischemic CBF in animals treated with both U-63557A and <z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi> was 30.0 ml/100 gm/min, significantly higher than in saline-infused gerbils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Brain levels of 6-keto <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> (PG)F1 alpha (the metabolite of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15552">PGI2</z:chebi>) were significantly higher in gerbils treated with U-63557A and <z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi> compared to gerbils given <z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi> alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This study indicates that U-63557A potentiates the effects of <z:chebi fb="113" ids="28364">EPA</z:chebi> on postischemic CBF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This is probably due to the ability of U-63557A to increase prostacyclin formation in the vessel wall </plain></SENT>
