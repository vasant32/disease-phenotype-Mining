<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is clear from rodent studies that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>hyperthermia</z:hpo> aggravates, whereas <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> lessens, this injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study we sought to relate core (Tc) and brain (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Tb</z:e>) temperature, measured via telemetry probes, after ISC produced in rats by bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> combined with systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> (2-VO model) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also tested whether spontaneous postischemic temperature fluctuations occurred and whether they were related to cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> as previous studies indicate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We report that Tc and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Tb</z:e> readings are similar and are highly correlated before and after 10 min of 2-VO ISC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the second experiment, rats were subjected to 8, 9, or 10 min of 2-VO ISC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Despite a range in CA1 injury among these animals, there was no evidence of post-ISC <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>hyperthermia</z:hpo>, contrary to earlier work, and neither temperature nor the physiological variables measured during ISC (e.g., <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>) predicted injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that, under the present conditions, 2-VO rats do not experience postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>hyperthermia</z:hpo>, which can be adequately measured with Tc telemetry probes </plain></SENT>
