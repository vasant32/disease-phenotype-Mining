<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study examined the effects of high-dose fentanyl on outcome in rats subjected to transient near-complete forebrain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rats were anesthetized with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi> and surgically prepared for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In one group (fentanyl; n = 15), intravenous fentanyl (400 micrograms/kg followed by an infusion of 16 micrograms/kg/min for 20 min) was administered and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi> was discontinued </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the remaining rats (control: n = 15), <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi> administration was continued and no fentanyl was given </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Following 10 min of bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and profound systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo>, animals were maintained normocapnic, normothermic, and mildly hyperoxemic for 8 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four days later, histologic and neurologic outcomes were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In another group of rats also administered <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi> (uncontrolled recovery; n = 15), no attempt was made to control physiologic variables during recovery from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fentanyl caused preischemic evidence of epileptoid activity but decreased the percentage of neurons that died in the CA1 sector of the hippocampus relative to control (p = 0.0005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Damage in the cortex or caudoputamen was not different from that in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Rats with an uncontrolled recovery had decreased damage in the cortex (p = 0.005) and caudoputamen (p = 0.00015) relative to control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In this model of forebrain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, fentanyl caused no worsening of histologic damage in the cortex or caudoputamen and decreased hippocampal CA1 injury despite major electroencephalographic activation in the immediate preischemic period </plain></SENT>
