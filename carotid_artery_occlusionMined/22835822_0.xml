<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: While histological injury following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> has been extensively characterized in rodents, evidence on the effects on executive functioning is still missing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to evaluate neuropsychological outcome following different severities of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in rats with the modified hole board test or the <z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water maze</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: With institutional review board approval, anesthetized rats were exposed to bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (BCAO) for escalating time intervals (0-12.5 min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Postoperatively cognitive performance was assessed using either the modified hole board test (mHB) or the <z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water maze</z:mp> (MWM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On postoperative day 14 rats were euthanized and intact neurons in five cerebral regions were counted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Rats of the 0 and 5 min groups showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> functional outcome with mild histological damage after 5 min of BCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Following 7.5 min of BCAO the mHB test showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive deficits</z:hpo> reflecting histological damage of the hippocampus while the MWM revealed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> functional outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Rats of the 10 and 12.5 min groups showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive deficits</z:hpo> in both tests, motor dysfunction and behavioral alterations in the mHB test and profound histological damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that the mHB is not inferior to the MWM for the evaluation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> following incomplete forebrain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>As the mHB additionally investigates a variety of behavioral dimensions and motor parameters in the same test environment, it is advantageous for the evaluation of interacting and potentially confounding <z:hpo ids='HP_0000708'>behavioral changes</z:hpo> following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in rats </plain></SENT>
