<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ucns exert CRF(2)-mediated cytoprotective effects against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion injury in cardiomyocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, little is known regarding potential retinoprotective effects of Ucns despite the known presence of CRF family <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> and their receptors (predominantly CRF(2 alpha)) in retina </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the present study investigated the effects of post-ischemic intravitreal Ucn 2 (2 nmol) administration on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000546'>retinal degeneration</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two-month-old rats were subjected to permanent bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, and their retinas were processed histologically after two weeks survival to determine the density of viable cells in the ganglion cell layer and the thickness of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> layers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In vehicle-treated subjects, carotid occlusion reduced retina thickness by approximately 60% as compared to sham-operated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, intraocular Ucn 2 treatment led to a marked amelioration of the <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> layers, and the thickness of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> layers was significantly increased by 40% compared to ischemic vehicle-treated subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ucn 2 treatment also increased the number of cells by 55% in the ganglion cell layer as compared to those from carotid-occluded retinas of vehicle-treated subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that intraocular Ucn 2 treatment may protect against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000546'>retinal degeneration</z:hpo>, results with potential therapeutic implications for ophthalmic diseases </plain></SENT>
