<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To identify neuroprotective changes in gene expression, we developed a neonatal mouse model of moderate to severe oxidative brain injury and hypothesized that recombinant erythropoietin (rEpo) would decrease the expression of proapoptotic and proinflammatory genes 24 and 48 h, respectively, after injury and increase the expression of neurogenic and angiogenic genes 168 h after injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Postnatal day 10 BALB-c mice underwent sham surgery or right common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> followed by alternating <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002319'>hyperoxia</z:mp> and were then treated with rEpo (5,000 U/kg s.c.) or saline (vehicle) daily for up to three doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, gross brain injury was assessed, then hippocampus, cortex, and thalamus were isolated for <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> or protein extraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Microarray analysis, real-time polymerase chain reaction, and Bio-Plex suspension array system validation were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>rEpo decreased both incidence and severity of brain injury (median injury score 3 vs. 0, p &lt; 0.0001) and reduced the injury-induced increases in interleukin-1alpha and interleukin-6 gene expression (p &lt; 0.001), with corresponding effects on protein translation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similarly, the expression of caspase-1, caspase-4, and caspase-6 and of p53 was increased by brain injury at 24 h, but mitigated by rEpo (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The interleukin-10 expression was higher in the rEpo-treated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Apoptotic and proinflammatory gene expression persisted for 168 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no increase in angiogenic gene expression at the time points studied </plain></SENT>
