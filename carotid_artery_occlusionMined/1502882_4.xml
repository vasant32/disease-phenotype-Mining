<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied the distribution of serum albumin in the hippocampus of the gerbil brain using light and electron microscopic immunocytochemical techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With light microscopy, there was no reaction for albumin for the first 12 h after unilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> for 10 min and reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At 12 h, the reaction was weak and limited to the neuropil in the subiculum-CA1 region (between the subiculum and the medial CA1 region) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 24 h, the reaction became intense in the neuropil and neuronal perikarya in the subiculum-CA1 and medial CA1 regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The electron microscopic immunocytochemical study of the subiculum-CA1 and medial CA1 regions revealed electron-dense immunoprecipitates in the extracellular space and the peripheral part of the apical dendrites as early as 30 min after reperfusion and in the astrocytic cytoplasm after reperfusion for 1 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, immunoprecipitates were not found in the neuronal perikarya until after reperfusion for 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The present study demonstrated prompt appearance of albumin in the extracellular space of the brain parenchyma after re-establishment of cerebral circulation and prompt accumulation in the peripheral part of the dendrites with spreading to neuronal perikarya, likely in the process of degeneration and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
