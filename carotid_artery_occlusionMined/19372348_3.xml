<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8093">Phenylephrine</z:chebi> is a selective alpha(1) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37886">adrenergic receptor agonist</z:chebi> that increases arterial blood pressure by peripheral vasoconstriction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, whether <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8093">phenylephrine</z:chebi> improves the outcome of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in patients with internal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery disease</z:e> during hemorrhagic shock is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: (Experiment 1) Twenty-one adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> and their lungs mechanically ventilated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After the right common carotid artery was ligated, arterial blood was withdrawn until mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) reached 30 mm Hg to induce <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After MAP was maintained at 30 mm Hg for 10 min, the animals were randomly allocated to three groups (n = 7 each) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8093">phenylephrine</z:chebi> group, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8093">phenylephrine</z:chebi> was administered IV to maintain a MAP of 70 +/- 3 mm Hg for 5 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the saline group, an identical volume of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> physiologic saline was continuously administered for 5 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the control group, neither <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8093">phenylephrine</z:chebi> nor saline was administered and MAP was maintained at 30 mm Hg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At 30 min of exsanguination, the withdrawn blood was reinfused IV at a rate of 0.25 mL/min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance images were serially acquired and apparent diffusion coefficient maps were created to determine the volume of cytotoxic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>(Experiment 2) To analyze the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8093">phenylephrine</z:chebi> on the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in the right middle cerebral artery territory, rCBF was measured using laser Doppler flowmetry in 15 additional rats (n = 5 each) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: (Experiment 1) At 10 min of exsanguination, there were no significant differences in the volume of cytotoxic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> among the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8093">phenylephrine</z:chebi> (357.5 +/- 93.5 mm(3)), saline (333.5 +/- 69.6 mm(3)), and control (303.1 +/- 85.8 mm(3)) groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Low apparent diffusion coefficient regions significantly expanded with time in the control group, whereas they started to decrease just after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8093">phenylephrine</z:chebi> infusion and almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had disappeared within 30 min in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8093">phenylephrine</z:chebi> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The final infarction volume in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8093">phenylephrine</z:chebi> group (3.9 +/- 2.6 mm(3), P &lt; 0.01) was significantly lower than that in the saline group (341.5 +/- 213.7 mm(3)) and control group (509.1 +/- 197.0 mm(3)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>(Experiment 2) Although rCBF decreased to 40%-50% of the baseline at 10 min of exsanguination, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8093">phenylephrine</z:chebi> immediately increased rCBF over the baseline level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In the saline group, rCBF increased significantly, but there was some delay compared with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8093">phenylephrine</z:chebi> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8093">Phenylephrine</z:chebi> ameliorated cytotoxic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> and decreased the infarction volume in a rat model of complete unilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8093">phenylephrine</z:chebi> transiently increased CBF without increasing the tonus of cerebral vasculature during hemorrhagic shock </plain></SENT>
