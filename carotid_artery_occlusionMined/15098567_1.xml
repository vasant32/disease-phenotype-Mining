<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Animals, under isofluorane anaesthesia, underwent 5 min of BCAO and were killed after 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The effects of EA were evaluated both on functional (with electrophysiological recordings of synaptic potentials in hippocampal slices) and morphological parameters (by counting the number of survived neurons in CA1 area of the hippocampus) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results demonstrated that the treatment of animals with EA (5 min before, during and 20 min after BCAO and 30 min per day in the following 5 days) did not modify either the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e>-induced reduction of synaptic potentials amplitude, either <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo> in the hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We conclude that, at least in this animal model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e>, EA does not exert a neuroprotective effect </plain></SENT>
