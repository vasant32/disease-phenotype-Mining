<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because oxidants may play an important role in mediating postischemic tissue injury, we evaluated this agent in two rat models of transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a model of global forebrain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, 23 male Wistar rats were subjected to 10 minutes of four-vessel occlusion followed by 72 hours of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The rats received three intraperitoneal injections of either vehicle (2% aqueous acacia) or test agent (40 mg/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a model of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, 19 spontaneously hypertensive rats were subjected to 2 hours of tandem middle cerebral and ipsilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> followed by 24 hours of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The rats received three intraperitoneal injections of either vehicle (2% aqueous acacia) or test agent (40 mg/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the global model, the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="37931,37932">phenothiazine</z:chebi> significantly protected the CA1 layer of the hippocampus, with a reduction in mean damage score from 2.1 +/- 0.3 for control rats to 1.0 +/- 0.4 for treated rats (p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the transient focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> model, the compound reduced cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume from 130.1 +/- 10.3 mm3 for control rats to 95.2 +/- 24.5 mm3 for treated rats (p less than 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although the primary mechanism responsible for the protective effect is unclear at the present time, our study is consistent with the hypothesis that oxidant-mediated <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation may be involved in the pathophysiology of postischemic brain injury </plain></SENT>
