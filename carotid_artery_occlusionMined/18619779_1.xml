<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its main limitation is that in the absence of adequate collateral flow it may not be tolerated by the patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine if preoperative identification of intracranial collaterals with computerized tomographic (CTA) or magnetic resonance (MRA) angiography can predict adequate collateral flow and neurological tolerance of ICA flow reversal for embolic protection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This was a study of patients undergoing transcervical carotid angioplasty and stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neuroprotection was established by ICA flow reversal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent preoperative cervical and cerebral noninvasive angiography with CTA or MRA and had at least one patent intracranial collateral </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mean carotid artery back pressure was measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neurological changes during carotid clamping and flow reversal were continuously monitored with electroencephalography (EEG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thirty-seven patients with at least one patent intracranial collateral on brain imaging with CTA or MRA were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mean carotid artery back pressure was 58 mm Hg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> procedures were technically successful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No EEG changes were present with common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and ICA flow reversal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>One patent intracranial collateral provides sufficient cerebral perfusion to perform carotid occlusion and flow reversal with absence of EEG changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Continued progress in noninvasive imaging modalities is becoming increasingly helpful in our understanding of cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp> and selection of patients for invasive carotid procedures </plain></SENT>
