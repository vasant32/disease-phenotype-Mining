<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: This retrospective study was undertaken to investigate the effect of presenting neurologic symptoms, vascular risk factors, and degree of contralateral internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> on subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rates of patients with internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (ICO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred sixty-seven patients with ICO were evaluated over a 5-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up was 39 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Initial symptoms included <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> in 29 patients (17%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in 71 patients (43%), nonhemispheric symptoms in 22 patients (13%), and no symptoms in 45 patients (27%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ninety percent of the presenting <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> occurred ipsilateral to the ICO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During follow-up 54 (32%) patients died, 10 (19%) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and 22 (41%) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 5-year cumulative survival rate was 63% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Subsequent neurologic events occurred in 26% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thirty patients (18%) had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> during follow-up, of which 20 (67%) occurred ipsilateral to the ICO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The 5-year <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-free rate was 76% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients who had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> had a less favorable 4-year <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-free rate (67%) than those who had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (92%) or those who originally had no symptoms (89%), p = 0.03 and p = 0.04, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In addition, there was a trend towards a worse 5-year contralateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-free rate in patients with contralateral stenosis of 50% to 99% (77%) compared with patients with less than 50% contralateral stenosis (94%), p = 0.08 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients underwent carotid endarterectomy on the nonoccluded side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There were no perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Carotid endarterectomy seemed to reduce the long-term <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> morbidity rate (p = 0.10) on the operated side in patients with 80% to 99% contralateral stenosis but did not perceptibly improve <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-free rates on the occluded side or in patients with 50% to 79% stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patients with ICO have a variable prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>There is a significant incidence of subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, which seems to be related to the presenting neurologic event and the degree of stenosis in the contralateral internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
