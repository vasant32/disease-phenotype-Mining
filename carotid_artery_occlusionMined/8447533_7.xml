<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Indications included ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (two), recent nondisabling hemispheric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (two), and transient nonhemispheric cerebral symptoms (two) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two asymptomatic patients with CCA occlusion and contralateral internal <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> underwent prophylactic revascularization prior to planned aortic surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were no perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, occlusions, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Late ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> occurred in two patients, and one patient had a single <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> after 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The four patients with preoperative transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> experienced relief of their symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Duplex ultrasound is an accurate screening modality for distal patency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Collateral filling of the internal or external carotid artery can usually be demonstrated after aortic arch or retrograde brachial contrast injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>End-to-end distal anastomosis after endarterectomy eliminates the original occlusive plaque as a potential source of emboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The subclavian artery is preferred for inflow on the left </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The CCA origin is easily accessible for inflow on the right </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Bypass of the occluded CCA is safe and may be effective in relieving transient cerebral ischemic symptoms, although long-term ipsilateral neurologic sequelae may still occur </plain></SENT>
