<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the angiographic characteristics of the phenomenon of "pseudodissection" and its clinical implications in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> endovascular treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis of angiographic and clinical data from 31 patients with ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> secondary to intracranial ICA occlusion, treated with endovascular therapy at two University-affiliated institutions, was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pseudodissection was defined as angiographic appearance of typical cervical ICA dissection with evidence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> inner vascular wall upon further catheter exploration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Angiographic appearance pseudodissection was identified in 7 out of 31 patients (22.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six patients had guide catheters placed proximal to pseudodissection in anticipation of stent placement for treatment of ICA dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 7 patients had further exploration of the presumed dissected segment (6 microcatheter, 1 diagnostic catheter) which demonstrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> vascular inner wall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The clot was located more commonly in the petro-cavernous segment in the pseudodissection patients (5/7, 71%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Carotid terminus clot was more common in ICA occlusion patients than pseudodissection patients (18/24, 75% vs. 2/7, 29% respectively, P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Recanalization was less common in pseudodissection patients compared to ICA occlusion patients (3/7 and 21/24 respectively, P = .029) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Early recognition of pseudodissection in the ICA is important in the setting of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> to avoid delay in treatment of intracranial ICA occlusion </plain></SENT>
