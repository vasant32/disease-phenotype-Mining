<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One group without significant arteriographic abnormalities and a group with a one-sided internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">Xenon</z:chebi> inhalation method (ISI) was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It seems to be difficult to draw any conclusions from the differences between mean hemispheric ISI values, especially for patients with fairly severe clinical symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In far the most patients without significant arteriographic abnormalities, no significant difference was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A great difference (high ISI ratio) for patients with no or only slight symptoms may indicate a disturbed blood flow to the hemisphere with the lower ISI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Such high ratios were only found in patients suffering from a one-sided occlusion of the internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This rather simple and harmless method of blood flow measurement may prove to be a valuable contribution toward insight into the pathophysiology of blood flow in patients, especially those suffering from one-sided internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
