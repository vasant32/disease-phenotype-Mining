<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Arterial and venous concentrations of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> were measured in blood samples taken before, 30 min after occlusion of the artery and 10 min after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The amount of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> produced depended on the length of time of burst suppression; the shorter it lasted, the larger the amount of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> produced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Only in patients with the shortest burst suppression times did the blood <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> levels rise above <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> levels can be used as indicators of how effective <z:chebi fb="25" ids="22693">barbiturates</z:chebi> are being in preventing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> during the time of carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
