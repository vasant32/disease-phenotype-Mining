<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: We sought to evaluate the safety and efficacy of carotid artery stenting (CAS) in high risk patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Carotid endarterectomy (CE) has been shown to be more effective than medical therapy, but it has limitations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Carotid artery stenting may be a reasonable alternative, particularly in high-risk patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We prospectively evaluated the safety and efficacy of CAS in 170 consecutive patients who underwent the procedure in 192 carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the patients enrolled, 129 (76%) would have been excluded from the major trials of CE and 54 (32%) were referred by vascular surgeons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This series represents a very high-risk group that included patients with unstable <z:mp ids='MP_0006112'>angina</z:mp>, previous ipsilateral CE, contralateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and other severe comorbid illnesses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only 25 (24%) of 104 symptomatic patients would have met the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET) entry criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patients' mean age was 73 +/- 8 years (95 confidence interval [CI] 57 to 89), and 42 patients (25%) were &gt; or = 80 years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients had an independent neurologic examination before and after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The procedural success rate was 99%, including 73 patients who had a coronary intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mean carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> was 78 +/- 10% before (95 CI 58 to 98) and 2 +/- 3% after the procedure (95 CI -4 to 8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>During the initial hospital period and 30 days after CAS, there was one major and two category 2 minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, as well as two category 1 minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> (total 30-day <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate was 2.9% for treated patients or 2.6% for treated arteries) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There were no <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarctions</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> during or within 30 days of CAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>None of the NASCET-eligible patients had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>At a mean follow-up of 19 +/- 11 months, three patients (2%) had asymptomatic restenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>No other major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> or neurologic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Carotid artery stenting is feasible, can be performed even in high-risk patients and is associated with a low restenosis rate </plain></SENT>
