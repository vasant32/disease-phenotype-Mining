<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The distribution of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) within the cerebral hemispheres of rats was investigated following an hypoxic-ischemic insult consisting of a 30-minute exposure to 6.5% to 7% inspired oxygen coupled with unilateral ligation of the common carotid artery and maintenance of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> blood pressure (modified Levine preparation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>rCBF was estimated by means of an autoradiographic method employing <z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31225">antipyrine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mean arterial <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37370">PO2</z:chebi> values of 26.8 to 27.5 mm Hg were attained during the insult period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>rCBF rose above control values in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> structures of the hemisphere contralateral to carotid artery ligation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Structures of the hemisphere ipsilateral to arterial ligation exhibited rCBF values less than those of the opposite side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the degree to which carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> reduced the rCBF of a structure relative to that of the opposite hemisphere varied greatly from region to region, with the greatest decrements occurring in the lateral cerebral cortex and the caudoputamen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Previous studies in this model have shown that these regions of the hemisphere ipsilateral to carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> are zones of frequent histological injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that inhomogeneities of rCBF may in part determine the phenomenon of "selective vulnerability" of the <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system to <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
