<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients treated with t-PA within 3 h of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> were studied prospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical factors and MRI findings independently associated with very poor outcome (modified Rankin Scale score 4-6) at 3 months after t-PA therapy were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The subjects were 117 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed the following independent factors associated with very poor outcome: time from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> to treatment ≥140 min (OR 2.790, 95% CI 1.082-7.193; p = 0.0337), baseline National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale score ≥20 (OR 3.794, 95% CI 1.199-12.009; p = 0.0233), <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> ≥180 mg/dl (OR 3.288, 95% CI 1.126-9.600; p = 0.0295), internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (OR 6.187, 95% CI 5.090-18.354; p = 0.0129) and M1 susceptibility vessel sign (OR 6.379, 95% CI 1.194-34.074; p = 0.030) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Those 5 variables were selected in the scale, with each factor as 1 point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Frequencies of patients with a very poor outcome for each score were as follows: score 0, 26.3%; score 1, 30.6%; score 2, 70.0%, and score 3-5, 100% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A clinical scale using clinical and MRI factors can predict very poor outcome in t-PA patients </plain></SENT>
