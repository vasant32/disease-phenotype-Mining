<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present study was to evaluate an association between the plasma concentration of total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> (tHcy) and stenosis or occlusion of the internal carotid artery (ICA) in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In total, 391 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> were evaluated from March 2007 to February 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The criterion for ICA stenosis or occlusion was set at greater than 50% <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8069">luminal</z:chebi> narrowing or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">complete obstruction</z:e> in at least one ICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were assigned to one of three groups: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ICA, ICA stenosis, and ICA occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: ICA stenosis was found in 71 patients, whereas ICA occlusion in 22 patients (18.2% and 5.6%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Plasma tHcy was significantly higher in groups with ICA stenosis/occlusion with the highest value of ICA occlusion (14.6 ± 1.0 µmol/L, p = 0.025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A 1 µmol/L increase of tHcy showed an adjusted odds ratio of 1.12 (95% confidence intervals, 1.03-1.24, p=0.008) for ICA occlusion in a multivariate logistic model adjusted for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> possible confounders, including age, sex, vascular risk factors, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> classifications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Elevated levels of tHcy were significantly associated with the ICA occlusion, independent of vascular risk factors and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> subtypes </plain></SENT>
