<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We identified 20 patients whose occlusions did not warrant further investigation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fourteen occlusions were on the asymptomatic side, two were in patients who preferred medical treatment, two were in patients unsuitable for carotid endarterectomy, and two patients with bihemispheric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> were treated for the contralateral carotid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four very tight stenoses were found in the other seven patients, one of whom refused endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As the signs of a very tight stenosis are subtle, and the number of such stenoses that are treatable is low (three in 493), cerebral angiography is justified in doubtful cases to avoid missing potentially treatable lesions </plain></SENT>
