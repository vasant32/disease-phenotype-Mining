<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">Statins</z:chebi> are known to increase CVR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the influence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> treatment and other cofactors on CVR improvement in patients with ICAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sixty-six patients with ICAO were reexamined after 15 Â± 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CVR in both middle cerebral arteries was assessed by transcranial Doppler and inhalation of 7% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16526">CO(2)</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pre-defined cut-off values were used to define exhausted CVR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cofactors analyzed were: age, sex, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> treatment, degree of contralateral stenosis, quality of intracranial collateral flow, duration of ICAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean CVR did not differ between the two studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients had exhausted CVR at baseline, 11 of them improved above the cut-off at follow-up (55%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Factors significantly associated with this improvement were good collateral pattern at baseline (p = 0.0065) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> treatment (p = 0.0179) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Odds ratios for improving CVR were 36.0 [95% CI 2.7-476.3] for good collateral flow and 20.0 [95% CI 1.7-238.6] for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, exhausted CVR frequently improves during the course of ICAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Good collateral function and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> treatment are significantly associated with improving CVR </plain></SENT>
