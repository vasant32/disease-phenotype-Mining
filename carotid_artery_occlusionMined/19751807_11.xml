<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have provided evidence that PACAP is neuroprotective in several models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000546'>retinal degeneration</z:hpo> in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In our previous studies we showed that PACAP treatment significantly ameliorated the damaging effects of permanent bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (BCCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study cell-type-specific markers were used in the same models in order to further specify the protective effects of PACAP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In rats BCCAO led to severe degeneration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> layers that was attenuated by PACAP (100 pmol) administered unilaterally immediately following BCCAO into the vitreous body of <z:mp ids='MP_0005163'>one eye</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Retinas were processed for immunohistochemistry after 3 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunolabeling was executed for vesicular <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> transporter 1 (VGLUT 1), vesicular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16865">gamma-aminobutyric acid</z:chebi> transporter (VGAT), protein kinase Calpha (PKCalpha), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and calcium-binding proteins, such as calbindin, calretinin, parvalbumin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In BCCAO retinas, intensity of immunopositivity for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> antisera was dramatically decreased, except in the case of GFAP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In PACAP-treated retinas, immunostaining was similar to that of the control animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In summary, our study presented immunohistochemical identification of cell types sensitive to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> hypoperfusion and the protective effects of PACAP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This analysis revealed that the retinoprotective effects of PACAP are not phenotype-specific, but it rather influences general cytoprotective pathways irrespective of the neuronal subtypes in the retina subjected to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> hypoperfusion </plain></SENT>
