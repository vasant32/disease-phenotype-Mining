<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, the effect of cyclooxygenase inhibition by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="5855">ibuprofen</z:chebi> on post-ischemic eicosanoid production and delayed neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was evaluated in Wistar-Kyoto rats subjected to incomplete forebrain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In control (C) and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="5855">ibuprofen</z:chebi>-treated groups (n = 5 each), pre- and post-ischemic eicosanoid production in the caudate nucleus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29306">(CN)</z:chebi> and dorsal hippocampus (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HPC</z:e>) were evaluated by microdialysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="1" ids="5855">ibuprofen</z:chebi>-treated animals were given <z:chebi fb="1" ids="5855">ibuprofen</z:chebi>, 15 mg/kg i.v., prior to insertion of microdialysis probes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Forebrain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was induced by bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (BCAO) for 10 min with simultaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> to 35 Torr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28728">thromboxane B2</z:chebi> (TxB2), 6-keto-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28852">PGF1 alpha</z:chebi> and PGF2 alpha in the microdialysate were measured by radioimmunoassay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In two additional concurrent groups of rats (n = 10 each), neuronal injury in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HPC</z:e>, CN and cortex (parietal, temporal and entorhinal regions) was evaluated histologically three days after 10 min of forebrain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> with and without pre-ischemic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="5855">ibuprofen</z:chebi> administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the control microdialysis group, levels of TxB2, 6-keto-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28852">PGF1 alpha</z:chebi> and PGF2 alpha increased in both CN and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HPC</z:e> after probe insertion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These probe related increases were substantially reduced in the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="5855">ibuprofen</z:chebi> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and reperfusion in the control group, the levels of TxB2 and PGF2 alpha increased in both CN and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HPC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Levels of 6-keto-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28852">PGF1 alpha</z:chebi> increased in the CN but not in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HPC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The administration of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="5855">ibuprofen</z:chebi> substantially reduced post-ischemic TxB2 and PGF2 alpha levels in both CN and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HPC</z:e> and decreased 6-keto-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28852">PGF1 alpha</z:chebi> levels in the CN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The results of these initial microdialysis studies left the possibility that, in the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="5855">ibuprofen</z:chebi> group, the reduction in eicosanoid levels after probe penetration might have influenced the subsequent post-ischemic eicosanoid production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Therefore, in an additional group of animals (n = 5), <z:chebi fb="1" ids="5855">ibuprofen</z:chebi> was administered after probe insertion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Only PGF2 alpha levels were measured in this group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Increased levels of PGF2 alpha comparable to the original control group were detected after probe penetration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, after <z:chebi fb="1" ids="5855">ibuprofen</z:chebi> administration, the pre- and post-ischemic levels of PGF2 alpha were again significantly reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>In the histologic evaluation groups, overall neuronal injury was significantly less in the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="5855">ibuprofen</z:chebi> treated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>This protective effect of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="5855">ibuprofen</z:chebi> was most clearly evident in the CA3 sector of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HPC</z:e>.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
