<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Free radicals have been reported to play an important role in global cerebral I/R, and therefore, reduction of these might improve the outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we investigated the effect of hydrogen gas (H2) (a strong free radical scavenger) on the survival rate of mice following global cerebral I/R </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We further examined the histopathological outcome and also the brain water content (as a possible determinant of mortality) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Male C57BL/6J mice were subjected to global cerebral I/R by means of 45-min bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (BCCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 160 mice were divided into three groups: sham surgery (sham group), BCCAO without H2 (BCCAO group), and BCCAO treated with 1.3% H2 (BCCAO + H2 group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We observed that H2 treatment significantly (P = 0.0232) improved the 7-day survival rate of mice, from 8.3% (BCCAO group, n = 12) to 50% (BCCAO + H2 group, n = 10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Histopathological analysis revealed that H2 treatment significantly attenuated neuronal injury and autophagy in the hippocampal cornu ammonis 1 sector and also <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo>, after 24 h of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The beneficial effects of H2 treatment on brain injury were associated with significantly lower levels of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> markers (8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine and malondialdehyde) in the brain tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, we believe that H2 may be an effective treatment for global cerebral I/R </plain></SENT>
