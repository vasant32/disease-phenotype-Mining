<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied brain injury resulting from transient bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (BCAO) and reperfusion by simulating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027051" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MR|mi|AMI">heart attack</z:e> and restoration of circulation, respectively, in live C57Black6 mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This model is known to induce neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in the hippocampus, striatum, and cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report the appearance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> after transient BCAO of 60 minutes and 1 day of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hyperintensity in diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was detectable in the striatum, thalamus, and cortex but not in the hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To determine whether damage to the hippocampus can be detected in live animals, we infused a T(2) susceptibility magnetic resonance contrast agent (superparamagnetic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50822">iron oxide nanoparticles</z:chebi> [SPIONs]) that was linked to single-stranded <z:chebi fb="9" ids="16991">deoxyribonucleic acid</z:chebi> (DNA) complementary in sequence to c-fos messenger <z:chebi fb="3" ids="33697">ribonucleic acid</z:chebi> (SPION-cfos); we acquired in vivo T(2)*-weighted MRI 3 days later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SPION retention was measured as T(2)* (milliseconds) signal reduction or R(2)* value (s(-1)) elevation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We found that animals treated with 60-minute BCAO and 7-day reperfusion exhibited significantly less SPION retention in the hippocampus and cortex than sham-operated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that brain injury induced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001695'>cardiac arrest</z:hpo> can be detected in live animals </plain></SENT>
