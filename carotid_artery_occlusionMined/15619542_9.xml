<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A causal link between <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and WM damage has been demonstrated in rats; however, few attempts appear to have been made to test potential drugs for the alleviation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-related WM injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1695782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral hypoperfusion</z:e> via permanent, bilateral occlusion of the common carotid arteries of rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> ATP-sensitive <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> channel opener <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4495">diazoxide</z:chebi> (5 mg/kg) or its solvent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28262">dimethyl sulphoxide</z:chebi> (DMSO) was administered i.p </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>(0.25 ml) on 5 consecutive days after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sham-operated animals served as control for surgery, and non-treated rats as controls for treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirteen weeks after surgery, the animals were sacrificed and astrocytes and microglia were labeled immunocytochemically in the internal capsule, the corpus callosum and the optic tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The astrocytic proliferation was enhanced by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1695782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral hypoperfusion</z:e> in the optic tract, and reduced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4495">diazoxide</z:chebi> in DMSO, but not by DMSO alone in the corpus callosum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, microglial activation was enhanced two-fold in the corpus callosum and four-fold in the optic tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DMSO decreased microglial activation in the optic tract, while <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4495">diazoxide</z:chebi> in DMSO, but not DMSO alone, restored microglial activation to the control level in the corpus callosum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In summary, the rat optic tract appeared to be particularly vulnerable to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, while the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4495">diazoxide</z:chebi> was restricted to the corpus callosum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We conclude that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4495">diazoxide</z:chebi> dissolved in DMSO can moderate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-related neuroinflammation by suppressing glial reaction in selective cerebral WM areas </plain></SENT>
