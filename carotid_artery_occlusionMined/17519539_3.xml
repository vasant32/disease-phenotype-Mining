<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The mechanism of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0543822" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">atherosclerotic occlusive disease</z:e> and hemodynamic failure may be primarily hemodynamic or a combination of hemodynamic and embolic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical and imaging features of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eleven patients with complete atherosclerotic carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and increased oxygen extraction fraction measured in the hemisphere distal to the occlusion developed an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> during the observation phase of a prospective study of cerebral hemodynamics and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The medical and study records related to the endpoint event for these 11 patients were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Records were reviewed for evidence of associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> and for specific details of the neurological deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>Infarct</z:mpath> location was characterized, based on review of imaging and clinical features, as: (1) middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) core; (2) possible cortical border zone, or (3) internal border zone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One patient had a <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> infarction; the remaining 10 had <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Six of the 10 infarctions occurred in the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> core territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two of these 6 were fatal hemispheric events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One of the 10 infarctions occurred in the cortical border zone region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two of the remaining 3 infarctions were localized to the internal border zone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One was indeterminate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The clinical features and radiological patterns of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in many patients with hemodynamic impairment failure and carotid occlusion are most consistent with large artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0001727'>thromboembolic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These data suggest a synergistic effect between embolic and hemodynamic mechanisms for large artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0001727'>thromboembolic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
