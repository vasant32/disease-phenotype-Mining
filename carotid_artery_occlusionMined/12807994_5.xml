<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The amplitudes of fEPSPs recorded from the hippocampus ipsilateral to the occlusion were significantly more depressed with <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> than were the fEPSPs recorded from the contralateral hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> A1-selective <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, 8-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52880">cyclopentyl</z:chebi>-1,3-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="23818">dimethylxanthine</z:chebi> (8-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi>), blunted the hypoxic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> of the fEPSP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Tissue partial pressure of oxygen (Ptiss,O2) was measured in the ipsilateral and contralateral hippocampus using glass Clark-style microelectrodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ptiss,O2 fell to similar levels as a function of inspired oxygen in the ipsilateral and contralateral hippocampus, and in the ipsilateral hippocampus after administration of 8-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hippocampal blood flow (HBF) was measured using laser Doppler flowmetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A decline in HBF was associated with systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> in both hippocampi </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>HBF, as a function of inspired oxygen, fell significantly more in the ipsilateral than in the contralateral hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that endogenous <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> acting at the neuronal A1 receptor plays a major role in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> of synaptic transmission during hypoxic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The greater susceptibility of the fEPSP in the ipsilateral hippocampus to systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> cannot be explained entirely by differences in Ptiss,O2 or HBF between the two hemispheres </plain></SENT>
