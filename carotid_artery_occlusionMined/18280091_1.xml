<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that a subgroup of patients with frank <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> due to sudden occlusion of the internal carotid artery could safely undergo surgery to restore carotid patency and to rescue brain tissue not yet irreversibly damaged if current <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> diagnostic methods were applied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From November 1997 to March 2007, 1810 patients underwent carotid endarterectomy of the internal carotid artery for occlusive disease at our department </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Within the same period, 5369 patients were examined at our <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> unit, and 502 from this cohort underwent internal carotid artery reconstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A subgroup of 35 patients (28 men, 7 women; mean age, 61 +/- 10 years) underwent urgent surgical revascularization due to an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> &lt; or =72 hours (mean 25 +/- 17 hours) after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> symptoms and &lt; or =36 hours (mean 16 +/- 10 hours) after admission to our <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> unit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our diagnostic workup consisted of extracranial intracranial duplex sonography, cerebral computed tomography, digital subtraction angiography, magnetic resonance imaging, and angiography, including diffusion- and perfusion-weighted imaging, to discriminate between viable and irreversibly damaged brain tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The study excluded patients who presented an impaired level of consciousness, occlusion of the intracranial internal carotid artery, occlusion of the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery, or infarction more than one-third of the territory perfused by the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Imaging showed signs of recent ischemic infarction in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 35 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On admission, eight patients (23%) scored 0 to 2 points and 27 (77%) scored 3 to 5 points in Rankin scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Confirmed by postoperative Doppler and duplex sonography at discharge, internal carotid artery patency could be achieved in 30 of 35 cases (86%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>Intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> occurred in two patients (6%) and reinfarction in another two (6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two patients died during their hospital stay (30-day mortality, 6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Compared with the preoperative neurologic status, rates of clinical improvement (&gt; or =1 point in Rankin scale), stability, and deterioration were 57%, 31%, and 6%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Restoration of blood flow in an acutely occluded internal carotid artery can only be achieved in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our pilot study demonstrated that a thorough diagnostic workup allows selection of patients who may benefit from urgent revascularization of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in the stage of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>A prospective randomized multicenter trial comparing surgery with conservative medical treatment is needed </plain></SENT>
