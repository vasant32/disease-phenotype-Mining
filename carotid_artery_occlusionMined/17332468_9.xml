<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) has been suggested to stimulate collateral blood vessel growth in various models of hemodynamic compromise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of GM-CSF on cerebral hemodynamics and vessel growth in a rat model of chronically impaired cerebral blood flow (CBF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent sequential bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (BCO) and were treated with GM-CSF or saline for 6 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sham-occluded animals served as a control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Baseline CBF was measured by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="43448">iodo</z:chebi>[(14)C]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31225">antipyrine</z:chebi> autoradiography, and cerebrovascular reserve capacity was assessed by laser-Doppler flowmetry after application of 20 mg/kg body weight <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The capillary density and arterioles immunopositive for alpha-smooth muscle actin were counted on brain sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cerebral angioarchitecture was visualized with a latex perfusion technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Baseline CBF as measured by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="43448">iodo</z:chebi>[(14)C]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31225">antipyrine</z:chebi> autoradiography was not affected by BCO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The cerebrovascular reserve capacity, however, was significantly impaired 1 week after BCO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CBF and cerebrovascular reserve capacity recovered completely in GM-CSF-treated animals but not in solvent-treated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Histologic analysis of the hippocampus revealed integrity of the <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-vulnerable neurons in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The capillary density showed a very mild increase in GM-CSF-treated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, the number of intraparenchymal and leptomeningeal arterioles was significantly higher in GM-CSF-treated animals than in both other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Long-term GM-CSF treatment in a BCO model in rats leads to restoration of impaired cerebral hemodynamics and accompanies structural changes in the resistance-vessel network </plain></SENT>
