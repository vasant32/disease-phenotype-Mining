<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion, cerebral hemodynamics are likely to be stable due to collateral flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors evaluated cerebral hemodynamics in ICA occlusion using the sonographic method of cerebral blood flow volume (CBVF) measurement to find differences that might identify patients with large hemispheric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in ICA occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD AND RESULTS: The ultrasound method of CBVF measurement was used, which represents the sum of flow volumes of both internal carotid and both vertebal arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CBVF was measured in 29 patients with ICA occlusion including patients with (1) <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> ICA occlusion without <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, (2) <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> ICA occlusion with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, (3) <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ICA occlusion, and (4) ICA occlusion and large hemispheric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In ICA occlusion, overall CBVF is lower compared to healthy volunteers, due to a significant reduction of CBVF in groups 3 and 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Comparing groups, there were no differences in CBVF between groups 1, 2, and 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CBVF in group 4 is reduced compared to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By receiver-operating characteristic analysis, a CBVF cutoff value for large hemispheric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was computed with a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 95.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ICA occlusion is associated with decreased CBVF compared to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> ICA occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, ICA occlusion and large hemispheric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> are associated with decreased CBVF compared to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other groups, indicating instability of cerebral hemodynamics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CBVF measurement thus may be a useful tool in predicting large middle cerebral artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> early in ICA occlusion </plain></SENT>
