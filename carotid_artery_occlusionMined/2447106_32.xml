<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two days after a 5-min period of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, heavy calcium staining was histochemically demonstrated in circumscribed groups of nerve cells, located in the transition zone between the CA1 and CA3 areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This preceded complete neuronal cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> that was quantitatively assessed by measuring the intensity of Nissl staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After a 12-min period of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, extensive calcium loading was observed in conjunction with severe neuronal damage throughout the CA1 region as well in the dorsal nuclei of the thalamus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The extent of calcium staining decreased with time and was not seen at stages later than 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Already at 2 days after a 5-min period of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, a strong increase of glial fibrillary acidic protein immunoreactivity was seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This indicates a marked and early <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> of astrocytes that was not accompanied by an obvious proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neither the astrocytic response nor the neuronal calcium accumulation were observed in gerbils pretreated with propentofylline, HWA 285 (10 mg/kg, i.p.) 15 min before bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Also, the decrease of Nissl staining in the CA1 area after 5 and 12 min of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was considerably less pronounced and did not significantly differ from sham-operated controls </plain></SENT>
