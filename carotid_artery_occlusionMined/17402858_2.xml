<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A variety of biochemical processes ensue, including organ failure, cellular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study used male, Sprague-Dawley rats to assess the impact of cerebral insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using heat-shock protein 25 and 70 (HSP25, HSP70) as biomarkers, measured 24 h after injury, we tested the hypothesis that pharmacological induction of preconditioning can offer cytoprotection from combined <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> and Shock </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The compound, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4495">diazoxide</z:chebi> (DZ), is known to induce preconditioning through its effect as a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> ATP (mK(ATP)) channel opener and succinate dehydrogenase inhibitor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When administered 24 h prior to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> and Shock (delayed preconditioning), DZ increased cerebral cortical and hippocampal levels of HSP25 and HSP70 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A more clinically relevant treatment paradigm was tested, where DZ was administered after the induction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> and Shock (postconditioning) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When administered 60 min (but not 10 min) after the induction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> and Shock, DZ significantly increased HSP25 and HSP70 expression in the ipsilateral cerebral cortex and hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these results suggest that DZ treatment may be efficacious for <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> injury resulting from blood loss and <z:mp ids='MP_0002316'>anoxia</z:mp> from combined <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and hemorrhagic shock.
