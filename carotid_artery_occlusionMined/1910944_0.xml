<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SHR-SP were divided into three groups: control (sham-operation), non-treated, ONO-1016 group, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>Cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was produced by bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (BCAO) for 1 hr and then following reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The brain water content and local cerebral blood flow (LCBF) were determined by dry-wet method and <z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>-iodoantipyrine method 2 hr after start of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ONO-1016 was given intravenously at a dose of 100 micrograms/kg/min prior to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The brain water content increased in septum (SP), amygdala (AM) in both non-treated and ONO-1016 groups compared from those in control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, brain water contents in SP and midbrain were lower in ONO-1016 group than those in non-treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>LCBFs decreased to 50-80% in SP, cerebral cortex (CT), striatum (ST), hippocampus (HC) and AM in non-treated group, while LCBFs decreased to 60-80% in SP, CT, ST, AM in ONO-1016 group when compared from those in control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Decrease of LCBF in ST and HC in ONO-1016 group were less severe than those in non-treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>From these results, ONO-1016 may prevent the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002181'>brain edema</z:hpo> formation associated with hypoperfusion during reperfusion period after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in SHR-SP </plain></SENT>
