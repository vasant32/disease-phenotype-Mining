<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Chosen lectins, represented by synthetic plant glycoproteids, which are specifically bound to particular sugar residues (receptors) located on the cell surfaces were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Lectins recognizing the following sugar residues have been used in our experiment: 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>N-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi>-D-galactosyl (using Helix pomatia agg., <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53393">HPA</z:chebi>) 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>alpha-D-mannosyl and alpha-D-glucosyl (using Concanavalin A, Con A) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>beta-D-galactosyl (using Ricinus communis agg., RCA-120) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>beta-D-galactosyl and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7539">neuraminic acid</z:chebi> (using Arachis hypogaea-Peanut agg., <z:chebi fb="3" ids="48021">PNA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>N-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi>-galactosaminyl and N-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="7539">neuraminic acid</z:chebi> (using Wheat germ agg., WGA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Changes in the glycoconjugates localization were found in neurons, glial cells, vessels, white matter fibers or neuropil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>They were expressed by the weaking of the reaction with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="53393">HPA</z:chebi> in the hippocampus and white matter comparing to control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Con A receptors were considerably less susceptible to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, though appearance of positively stained glial cells not found in the control group has been observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Reaction with RCA-120 localized selectively in the network of capillary vessels decreased considerably </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Similarly, receptors marked using <z:chebi fb="3" ids="48021">PNA</z:chebi> revealed reduction of staining reaction in white matter as well as in hippocampal interneurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Using WGA we have also observed that staining reaction was reduced in capillary as well as in neuropil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>That lectin indicated additionally strong accumulation of its sugar residues in glial cells appearing as a result of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in particular sectors of hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The same cells were also Con A positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The presented results indicate functionally and histochemically perceptible changes taking place in particular <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> elements as a result of short <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, expressed by the disturbances in the localization and accumulation of specific sugar residues examined with the use of lectin technique </plain></SENT>
