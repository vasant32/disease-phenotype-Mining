<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Intra-arterial therapies are being used more frequently in patients presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596298" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral occlusions</z:e>, but they have been limited by the potential for <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine whether pretreatment computed tomography perfusion parameters might help to identify patients at a higher risk of developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> after intra-arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> revascularization treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and Michigan State University who underwent computed tomography perfusion imaging of the brain before intra-arterial thrombolysis between January 2006 and June 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Demographic information, angiographic variables, and types of endovascular interventions were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean transit time and cerebral blood volumes were recorded for the ipsilateral and contralateral middle cerebral artery territories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A binary logistic regression model was constructed to determine the independent predictors of developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 57 patients (33 from the University of Pittsburgh and 24 from Michigan State University) with a mean age of 66 +/- 13 years and mean National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale scores of 16 +/- 5 were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The overall recanalization (Thrombolysis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>Myocardial Infarction</z:hpo> Trial scale 2 or 3 flow) was 72% for the cohort, and the overall rate of parenchymal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> was 5 of 57 (9%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The overall <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> rate was 19 of 57 (33%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The only variable found to be predictive of the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> after intervention was reduced pretreatment cerebral blood volume (odds ratio, 0.49; 95% confidence interval, 0.35-0.91; P &lt; 0.022) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A reduced pretreatment ipsilateral cerebral blood volume value before endovascular revascularization of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> middle cerebral artery or internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> significantly increases the risk of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
