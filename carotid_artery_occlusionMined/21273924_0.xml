<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) mobilizes hematopoietic bone marrow cells into systemic circulation and has been used clinically to treat chemotherapy-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, G-CSF was shown to have neuroprotective and angiogenetic effects in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of G-CSF for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> after indirect bypass surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: : <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1695782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral hypoperfusions</z:e> were induced in male Wistar rats by permanent bilateral internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (BICAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After BICAO, unilateral indirect bypass and encephalogaleosynangiosis (EGS) were performed, and human recombinant G-CSF (10 μg/kg) or saline was injected intramuscularly for 5 consecutive days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We measured regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) by laser Doppler flowmetry and performed immunohistochemical analysis 21 days after BICAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: BICAO decreased rCBF to 62.52% ± 5.8% of control (P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The rCBF increased significantly 21 days after BICAO in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> treatment groups (n = 10; P &lt; .05) except the G-E- group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The rCBF increase observed in the G+E+ group was significantly higher than that observed in other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both G-CSF and EGS treatments significantly increased the number of small vessels (P &lt; .01), and G-CSF and EGS showed additive effect in increasing the number of small vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Combined use of G-CSF and indirect bypass surgery induces an increase in rCBF and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> under conditions of cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> hypoperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This is the first report to demonstrate that G-CSF can enhance <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> induced by indirect bypass surgery, and that this combined therapy is a safe and easy method of treatment </plain></SENT>
