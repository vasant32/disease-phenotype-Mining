<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: There is little reported of the safety and efficacy of high-dose intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (alteplase) in combination with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> anticoagulation in patients presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-two patients with severe hemispheric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> syndrome caused by angiographically proven middle cerebral artery and/or intracranial internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> were treated with 100 mg alteplase by intravenous infusion over 90 minutes within a mean +/- SD of 226 +/- 68 minutes after symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recanalization was assessed by digital subtraction angiography in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients immediately after treatment and by transcranial Doppler monitoring (n = 30) and/or a third angiogram (n = 5) 12-24 hours later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Complete or partial reperfusion was observed in 11 patients (34%) 90 minutes after the initiation of alteplase infusion and in 17 patients (53%) within 12-24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hemorrhagic infarction without clinical deterioration was detected by follow-up computed tomography in nine patients (28%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fatal parenchymal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> occurred in three patients (9%) with huge middle cerebral artery <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serious <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> from the puncture site occurred in two patients (6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Good clinical outcome correlated with reperfusion (p less than 0.05) and the presence of grade 2 collateral blood flow (p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: When 100 mg of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator was given within the first 6 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> together with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> the incidence of deleterious <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> was less than 10% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Reperfusion and effective collateral blood flow seem to be two important factors associated with a small <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume and good clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
