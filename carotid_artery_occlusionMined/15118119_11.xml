<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eight patients in whom the test was successful were evaluated with perfusion computed tomography (CT) in the resting state and after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> challenge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three of the patients showed symmetric blood flow and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One of them underwent permanent carotid occlusion and did not develop any delayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The remaining five patients showed asymmetric blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One of them had markedly low blood flow and abnormal response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patient developed ipsilateral hemispheric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> following permanent carotid occlusion after the superficial temporal artery to middle cerebral artery bypass graft occluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the other four patients, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0853404" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">steal phenomenon</z:e> was seen in ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although definitive quantitative values for perfusion CT are not yet standardized, it may be feasible to predict that the patients with symmetric blood flow and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi>-enhanced challenge test results will do well after permanent carotid occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with asymmetric blood flow and abnormal response to the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> challenge test may require a revascularization procedure to protect them from delayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
