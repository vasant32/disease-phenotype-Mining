<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: In organ bath studies with arterial rings precontracted with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8093">phenylephrine</z:chebi> (1 microM), before and after carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, changes in isometric tension were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi> and endothelium-independent vasorelaxation by VIP were significantly reduced, started from 30 and 10 min of carotid occlusion, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Inhibitory effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi> on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi> vasorelaxation was enhanced whilst effect of N(G)-<z:chebi fb="13" ids="29785">nitro</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-arginine</z:chebi> reduced, started from 30 min of carotid occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="29321">Sodium nitroprusside</z:chebi>-induced vasorelaxation was not changed after carotid occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of VIP vasorelaxation by L-N(omega)-nitroarginine-2,4-L-diaminobutyric-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29337,32988">amide</z:chebi>, was reduced, started from 30 min of carotid occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="42471">Forskolin</z:chebi> enhanced VIP-induced vasorelaxation in control rings but this effect was reduced started from 30 min of occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the presence of VIP, vasorelaxant effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi> was increased; the increase was reduced, started from 10 min of carotid occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The present investigation provides evidence for the decreased responsiveness to both, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi>-endothelium-dependent and VIP-endothelium-independent vasorelaxation in rabbit facial artery after carotid occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, the data suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> alters contribution of endothelial nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (eNO) and <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi> to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15355">ACh</z:chebi>, and vascular smooth muscle's cAMP and neuronal NO to VIP vasorelaxant effects </plain></SENT>
