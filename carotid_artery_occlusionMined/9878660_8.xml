<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several small series report excellent results of ICA revascularization in relieving cerebral ischemic symptoms in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The natural history of CCAO with patent ICA in the asymptomatic patient, however, is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Greenville Memorial Hospital Vascular Teaching Service registry and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> carotid duplex scans done in the Greenville Hospital System vascular laboratory from January 1994 through December 1997 were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data collection included chart review, phone interviews, and the review of angiograms and duplex scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that carotid duplex is more sensitive for detecting ICA flow after CCAO than routine contrast angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It also suggests that while rare in presentation, asymptomatic patients with CCAO and a patent ICA appear to have a benign neurologic course and can probably be observed without a high risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
