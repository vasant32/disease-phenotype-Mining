<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography to study seven patients with unilateral internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and no cortical infarction in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The distributions of red blood cell and plasma volumes were assessed using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36932">oxygen-15</z:chebi>-labeled <z:chebi fb="168" ids="17245">carbon monoxide</z:chebi> and copper-62-labeled human serum albumin-dithiosemicarbazone tracers, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The calculated hematocrit value was compared with the hemodynamic and metabolic parameters measured with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36932">oxygen-15</z:chebi> steady-state technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the cerebral cortex, the value of the cerebral hematocrit varied but was correlated with the hemodynamic and metabolic status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Stepwise regression analysis revealed that the large vessel hematocrit, the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen, and the cerebral blood flow or the oxygen extraction fraction accounted for a significant proportion of variance of the cerebral hematocrit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The oxygen extraction fraction and the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen negatively correlated with the cerebral hematocrit, whereas the cerebral blood flow correlated positively: patients with reduced blood supply relative to metabolic demand (decreased blood flow with increased oxygen extraction fraction) showed low hematocrit values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> stage, regional cerebral hematocrit may vary according to cerebral hemodynamics and metabolic status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Regional cerebral hematocrit may decrease with hemodynamic compromise unless oxygen metabolism concomitantly decreases </plain></SENT>
