<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between ischemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> and intracranial collateral blood flow in patients with unilateral occlusion of the internal carotid artery (ICA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty-eight consecutive patients were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ischemic lesions on MRI were identified on hard copies, and volume measurements of the lesions were performed on an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> workstation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intracranial collateral pathways were studied with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography, digital subtraction angiography, and transcranial Doppler sonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The presence of collateral flow via the anterior communicating artery (ACoA) was associated with a reduction in prevalence (p = 0.01) and volume (p = 0.008) of internal border zone <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the occluded ICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Absence of collateral blood flow via the circle of Willis was associated with an increase in prevalence (p = 0.007) and volume (p = 0.005) of internal border zone <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No association between any collateral flow pattern in the circle of Willis and periventricular lesions or lacunar, territorial, or external border zone <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No association between collateral flow via the ophthalmic artery or leptomeningeal vessels with any type of ischemic lesion was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Collateral flow via the ACoA is associated with a reduction of the prevalence and volume of internal border zone lesions but not with any other type of ischemic lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The presence of a functional posterior communicating artery or secondary collateral pathways is not associated with the prevalence of any type of ischemic lesion </plain></SENT>
