<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The effects of bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (BCO) and carotid sinus nerve stimulation (CSNS) on left ventricular (LV) pressure (P), diameter (D), velocity of contraction (V), rate of change of pressure (dP/dt), and cardiac output were studied in conscious dogs instrumented with ultrasonic diameter gauges, miniature pressure gauges, and aortic electromagnetic flow transducers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effects of BCO and CSNS were also studied after automatic blockade and were compared to similar alterations in pressure produced by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi>, methoxamine, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28787">nitroglycerin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When heart rate was maintained constant with atrial stimulation, BCO had little effect on ventricular contractility, increasing isolength systolic pressure (LV P(iso)) by 36% while isolength velocity of myocardial shortening (V(iso)) decreased by 12% and (dP/dt)/P fell by 8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These effects could be explained largely by vasoconstriction, since elevating systolic pressure with methoxamine produced similar results, while <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> increased V(iso) by 36% and (dP/dt)/P by 56% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CSNS produced directionally opposite results from BCO; it decreased P(iso) by 15%, V(iso) increased by 11%, while (dP/dt)/P remained almost constant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These effects may be explained largely by vasodilatation since reducing systolic pressure to the same level with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28787">nitroglycerin</z:chebi> produced similar results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When peripheral vasoconstriction was minimized by phenoxybenzamine pretreatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>BCO produced a slight positive inotropic effect (P(iso) increased by 8%, V(iso) by 4%, and (dp/dt)/P by 10%), while CSNS produced a slight negative inotropic effect (P(iso) decreased by 3%, V(iso) decreased by 5%, and (dP/dt)/P by 7%).Thus, in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, healthy, conscious dog, the carotid sinuses exert relatively little control of the inotropic state of the left ventricle; moreover, this small inotropic action is masked by the more powerful effects on peripheral resistance </plain></SENT>
