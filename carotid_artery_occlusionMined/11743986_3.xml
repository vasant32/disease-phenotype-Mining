<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We performed real-time monitoring of the extracellular <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> dynamics in the rat striatum in vivo using the microdialysis electrode technique, during an experimental penumbral condition of moderate global <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and activated <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The local cerebral blood flow (CBF) was measured with a laser-Doppler probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One minute after bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (BCAO), CBF was reduced to approximately 60% of the pre-ischemic value and it remained at this level during the period of occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After BCAO, a transient depolarization and a transient increase in extracellular <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> concentration ([Glu]e) were seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In other rats, 500 microM <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">N-methyl-D-aspartate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi>) was locally micro-transfused for 30 min prior to BCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Upon induction of BCAO, an anoxic depolarization-like depolarization and a gradual increase in [Glu]e that continued over the duration of BCAO were seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After BCAO was terminated, the direct current (DC) rapidly recovered to the basal level, while [Glu]e gradually decreased to the basal level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In rats that were locally micro-transfused with 500 microM Kainate prior to BCAO, DC and [Glu]e did not differ significantly from control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment with MK-801 prior to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> treatment completely inhibited the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi>-induced changes in DC and [Glu]e </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment with NBQX prior to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> treatment did not inhibit the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi>-induced changes in DC and [Glu]e </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Consequently, we found that activation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> receptors by elevated [Glu]e exerts an important effect on [Glu]e dynamics in the spreading <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> region very early in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stage of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in vivo </plain></SENT>
