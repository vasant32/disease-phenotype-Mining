<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Transcranial Doppler (TCD) studies demonstrated the importance of cerebral vasomotor reactivity (VMR) on the outcome of carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (CAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>So far, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography represents the best technique for detecting both hemodynamic and metabolic aspects of cerebral perfusion adaptive processes in cerebrovascular patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a new method allowing for a non-invasive assessment of cerebral blood flow and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (Hb) oxygenation parameters.A recent TCD and NIRS study demonstrated that patients with symptomatic CAO had lower VMR values measured by TCD and lower oxygen saturation (oxygen%) increases detected by NIRS than asymptomatic ones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The parameters were obtained simultaneously after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16526">CO(2)</z:chebi> inhalation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The present study aims to investigate if Hb oxygen % could represent also at rest a marker of hemodynamic status in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0741975" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid disease</z:e>.Thirty-five symptomatic and 17 asymptomatic patients with CAO underwent a simultaneous examination by means of TCD and NIRS at rest condition and during <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16526">CO(2)</z:chebi> reactivity test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic patients presented with oxygen% values at rest higher (p = 0.001) and VMR values lower (p &lt; 0.001) than asymptomatic subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>According to a logistic model, for each unitary VMR increase, the odds of being symptomatic decreases of about 10% (OR = 0.9, p = 0.001); for each unitary increase of oxygen% at baseline, this odd increases of about 23% (OR = 1.23, p = 0.031) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition to TCD VMR values, oxygen <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> saturation at rest detected by NIRS can discriminate symptomatic from asymptomatic patients with CAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>NIRS can add an important contribution to explain pathophysiological mechanisms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> occurrence </plain></SENT>
