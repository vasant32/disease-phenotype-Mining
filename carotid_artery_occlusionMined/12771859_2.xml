<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> of embolic origin a partial recanalization of the intracranial occluded vessel occurs with a high incidence (as high as 80%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the literature, we find few cases of revascularization, detected with color flow imaging (CFI) or with arteriography (AGF), at carotid siphon or at the origin of an occluded internal carotid artery (ICA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Up to now there have been no reliable data on the incidence and clinical consequences of SR of an extracranial ICA occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this case-report we document 8 cases of SR of occluded ICA observed in the last 10 years in our Care Unit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We observed 8 complete ICA occlusion at the origin, detected with CFI (8 of 8) and with AGF (7 of 8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> symptomatic patients and 2 of 5 asymptomatic patients underwent CT scan in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent CFI follow-up (every 6-12 monhts) to evaluate contralateral CCA and ICA and the presence of new focal neurological symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients assumed BMT (antiplatelet or <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: SR occurred in 6 patients between 24 and 96 months, in 1 patient within 8 months and 1 patient within 6 months from the diagnosis of ICA occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis of SR was based in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with CFI and in 4 patients confirmed with AGF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Five patients underwent CT scan that excluded haemorrhagic transformation of previous ischemic areas or new ischemic events (2 patients did CT scan only after SR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent CFI follow-up in a 3-88 months period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There were no new focal neurological symptoms in 7 of 8 patients, 1 patient presented aspecific neurological symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Diagnosing SR of occluded extracranical ICA seems to be more frequent than expected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>SR is an event that has to be researched in follow-up of these patients; besides, it seems to have a relatively benign outcome with respect to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of new neurological symptoms </plain></SENT>
