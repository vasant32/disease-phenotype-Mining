<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE AND IMPORTANCE: We successfully treated a patient with stenosis of the left subclavian artery, complicated by bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, via axilloaxillary bypass surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 67-year-old patient with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> underwent neck irradiation for treatment of a vocal cord <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three months later, he began to experience transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0002273'>tetraparesis</z:hpo> several times per day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The blood pressure measurements for his right and left arms were different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Supratentorial blood flow was markedly low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The common carotid arteries were bilaterally occluded, and the right vertebral artery was hypoplastic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, only the left vertebral artery contributed to the patient's cerebral circulation; his left subclavian artery was severely stenotic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: The patient underwent axilloaxillary bypass surgery because the procedure avoids thoracotomy or sternotomy, manipulation of the carotid artery, and interruption of the vertebral artery blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The patient has been free of symptoms for more than 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Neurosurgeons should be aware that extra-anatomic bypass surgery is an effective treatment option for selected patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
