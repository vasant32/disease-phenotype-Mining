<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A case with spontaneous carotid-cavernous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> treated by balloon catheter technique combined with a extra-intracranial by-pass using a saphenous vein graft between the common carotid artery and the middle cerebral artery is reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 72-year-old female was admitted with complaints of recurrent symptoms of carotid-cavernous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> 4 months after spontaneous remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Angiograms showed the presence left internal carotid-cavernous sinus <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Poor cross-filling from the right internal carotid artery to the territory of the left internal carotid artery via the hypoplastic right A1 and left posterior communicating artery was also observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Symptoms such as chemosis, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000520'>exophthalmos</z:hpo> and visual disturbance gradually progressed during the hospitalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A common carotid-middle cerebral artery anastomosis was performed with a saphenous vein graft and the carotid cavernous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> was occluded directly with a balloon catheter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The blood flow via the graft, cortical blood flow, cortical tissue O2 and <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> were continuously measured during the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After the internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, sufficient blood flow via the graft and no significant changes of the cortical blood flow, cortical tissue O2 and <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The postoperative angiogram showed that the by-pass was patent and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> branches of the left internal carotid artery were filled via the by-pass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The postoperative course was uneventful and the progressive symptoms improved except for visual disturbance on the left </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>She is in good condition one year after the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The usefulness of this surgical procedure with monitoring of cerebral blood flow and metabolism during operation is also discussed </plain></SENT>
