<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On adulthood, hippocampal volume was analyzed by stereological techniques, along with measures of cortical thickness and hemispheric area at the level -3.30 mm from bregma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>HI caused a reduction of volume of whole hippocampus, of Amon's horn and of dentate gyrus, with no effect on cortical and hemispheric measures; neonatal handling prevented such effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This is the first report showing that both tactile stimulation and neonatal handling exert a morphological neuroprotective action for HI-induced damage to the hippocampus </plain></SENT>
