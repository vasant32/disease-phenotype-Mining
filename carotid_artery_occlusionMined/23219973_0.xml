<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since nna1 is also expressed in hippocampal neurons, we investigated their vulnerability to hypoperfusion in AMS mouse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eight-week-old male <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild type</z:mp> (WT) and AMS mice were subjected to bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (BCCAO) for 10min and sacrificed 1, 3, 7 and 28 days after BCCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nissl staining revealed the neuronal cell loss and pyknotic change in the CA1 of AMS mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>TUNEL(+) apoptotic cells were found in the area at 7 days in AMS mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Bcl-2 mRNA and protein in WT hippocampus were increased, while they were not increased in AMS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Bax <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was increased in AMS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, Bax activation was immunohistochemically demonstrated only in AMS at 3 and 7 days after BCCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An oxidative DNA damage marker, 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine-positive cells were increased in both strains at 1 day; decreased in WT at 3 days but remained high in AMS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>BCCAO increased <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi>, an <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi>, in WT, but not in AMS at 3 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> uncoupling protein 2, a regulator of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp>, was increased only in WT at 1 day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Nna1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was similarly expressed in WT and AMS, but the protein was undetectable in AMS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Thus, our results indicate the increased vulnerability of hippocampal CA1 neurons of AMS mice to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1695782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral hypoperfusion</z:e> could be due to an imbalance between <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and antioxidative defense system </plain></SENT>
