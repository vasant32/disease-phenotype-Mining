<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to investigate the potential energy preserving effect of permanent bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (BCCAO) towards additional systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> of severe duration (30 min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, the role of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> A1 receptors in cerebral ischaemic preconditioning was investigated in male Wistar rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, oligaemic rats were assigned randomly to continuous treatment with the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> A1 receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> 2-chloro-N6-cyclopentyladenosine (CCPA) or the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> A1 receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> 8-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52880">cyclopentyl</z:chebi>-1,3-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="23818">dimethylxanthine</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi>), receiving daily intraperitoneal infusions of 0.1 mg/kg bodyweight CCPA or <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi> or placebo (200 microL aqueous 2-hydropropyl-beta-cyclodextrin) at a delivery rate of 0.5 microL/h over 14 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Haemodynamic parameters and arterial blood gases were monitored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Rat cortical energy metabolites ATP, <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi>, phosphocreatine and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> were measured using HPLC techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">Adenosine</z:chebi> A1 receptor expression was determined by immunhistochemistry and quantified by western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two weeks of permanent BCCAO induced an 'energy saving' effect in rat cortical ATP concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Under subchronic conditions, significant increases were detected in <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi> concentrations after CCPA compared with placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Because similar changes were also seen after <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27656">CPT</z:chebi>, this <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> A1 receptor-mediated effect does not seems to be specific </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, no differences in <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> A1 receptor expression could be detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">Adenosine</z:chebi> was not specifically involved in the 'preconditioning-like' effect via the modulation of the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> A1 receptor in the present oligaemia model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Obviously, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> A1 receptor-specific effects after delayed cerebral ischaemic preconditioning do not seem to play an essential role if BCCAO is followed by a prolonged additional severe ischaemic event </plain></SENT>
