<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Measuring somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP), electroencephalogram (EEG), direct current (DC) potential, and histology, we compared the temporal evolution of cortical functional perturbations as well as neuronal integrity in a model of unilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and systemic hypobaric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> (HH) at the lower limit of cerebral blood flow autoregulation (50 mm Hg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serial measurements of EEG power spectra as well as SEP-amplitudes and latencies of N10.3 were performed before, during, and up to 60 min after 30 min-HH (n=7) or the control condition (n=7) in male Wistar rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In two additional groups (with [n=7] or without [n=7] HH), cortical spreading <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depressions</z:hpo> (CSD) were elicited to ascertain their contribution to brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hematoxilin-Eosin (H&amp;E) staining was used to assess neuronal cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> at 5 days after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Relative to baseline, HH attenuated ipsilateral EEG power spectrum (by maximally 62%), increased SEP-latencies (by approximately 6-10%) and amplitudes (by approximately 57-70%), and induced selective neuronal cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus (P&lt;0.05 vs. contralateral) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Spontaneous CSD occurred in approximately 30% of HH-animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Repolarization of the DC-potential during HH was significantly prolonged relative to normotensive conditions (10.3+/-11.5 min, P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our model may help to understand underlying pathophysiology and improve outcome in a clinical subset of patients with carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> and transient systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
