<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the efficacy of three dimensional CT angiography (3D-CTA) for a first diagnosis of occlusive cerebrovascular disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sixty-two patients, who were suspected of occlusive cerebrovascular disorder on the basis of neurological findings or initial plain CT findings, were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>3D-CTA was performed at the first medical examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As a result, two patients were diagnosed with ICA (internal carotid artery) occlusion, nine with <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> (middle cerebral artery) occlusion, and one with BA (basilar artery) occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> twelve patients underwent cerebral angiography immediately after those 3D-CTA in every case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Angiographical findings were the same as 3D-CTA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interventional superselective thrombolytic therapy was performed in ten of the twelve patients, and recanalization resulted in four of them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>3D-CTA may also be able to determine whether the occlusive vessel is the chief cerebral artery or the perforating artery </plain></SENT>
