<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied whether or not circulating <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamines</z:chebi> of adrenal origin play a major role in cardiovascular responses evoked by bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (3 min) in anaesthetized dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the control group, the following parameters increased significantly (P less than 0.05) during bilateral carotid occlusion: aortic systolic pressure, heart rate, net adrenal <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi> output, net renal <z:chebi fb="15" ids="33569">noradrenaline</z:chebi> output, and plasma <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi> concentrations in aortic blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Similar responses were obtained during the second occlusion performed approximately 25 min after the first occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After functional adrenalectomy (ADRX: diversion of adrenal venous blood flow), the increase in aortic <z:chebi fb="47" ids="28918,33568">adrenaline</z:chebi> concentration observed during bilateral carotid occlusion was abolished </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The increase in aortic <z:chebi fb="15" ids="33569">noradrenaline</z:chebi> concentration during the occlusion was significantly attenuated by approximately 60% (P less than 0.01) after ADRX </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The increase in net renal <z:chebi fb="15" ids="33569">noradrenaline</z:chebi> output during bilateral carotid occlusion after ADRX was not different from that observed before ADRX </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Similarly, the response of aortic systolic pressure and heart rate during the occlusion was unaffected by ADRX </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the increase in net adrenal <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi> output during the occlusion was not affected by ADRX itself </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>From these results, we conclude that the increase in circulating <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamines</z:chebi> of adrenal origin during bilateral carotid occlusion is not a major determinant for the increases in aortic pressure and heart rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that these cardiovascular responses during the occlusion are mediated principally by neuronal <z:chebi fb="15" ids="33569">noradrenaline</z:chebi> released from peripheral sympathetic nerve terminals </plain></SENT>
