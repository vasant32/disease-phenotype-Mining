<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>GPCRs mediate the action of messengers that are key modulators of cardiac and vascular cell function, such as growth and differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>GRKs are members of a multigene family, which are classified into three subfamilies and are found in cardiac, vascular and cerebral tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Increasing evidence strongly supports the hypothesis that vascular damage is an early contributor to the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002511'>Alzheimer disease</z:hpo> (AD) and/or other pathology that can mimic human AD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Based on this hypothesis, and since kinases of this family are known to regulate numerous receptor functions both in the brain, myocardium and elsewhere, we explored cellular and subcellular localization by immunoreactivity of G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2), also known as beta-adrenergic receptor kinase-1(betaARK1), in the early pathogenesis of AD and in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> reperfusion injury models of brain hypoperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we used the two-vessel carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> model, namely the 2-VO system that results in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> brain hypoperfusion (CBH) and mimics mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> (MCI) and vascular changes in AD pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our findings demonstrate the early overexpression of GRK2 member kinase in the cerebrovasculature, especially endothelial cells (EC) following CBH, as well as in select cells from human AD tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We found a significant increase in GRK2 immunoreactivity in the EC of AD patients and after CBH, which preceded any <z:mpath ids='MPATH_34'>amyloid deposition</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Since GRK2 activity is associated with certain compensatory changes in brain cellular compartments and in ischemic cardiac tissue, our findings suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> hypoperfusion initiates <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> in these conditions and appears to be the main initiating injury stimulus for disruption of brain and cerebrovascular homeostasis and metabolism </plain></SENT>
