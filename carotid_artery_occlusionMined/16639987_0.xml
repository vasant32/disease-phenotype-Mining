<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Subjects were 40 rats, which were randomly allocated to control, single ECS (sECS), repeated ECS (rECS) or sham group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>sECS group and rECS group received ECS only once 2 days before the subsequent 8-min forebrain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and once a day for 9 consecutive days until 2 days before the exposure to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Forebrain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was produced by modified bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Control group underwent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> without ECS pretreatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sham group received ECS without following exposure to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pyramidal cell injury of the hippocampal CA1 sector was microscopically examined on the 7th day after the ischemic exposure or the sham operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Damage of the pyramidal cells was assessed by the injury ratio, which was ratio of non-viable pyramidal cells to the whole pyramidal cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The injury ratios of CA1 pyramidal cells in sECS, rECS and control groups were 30.5 +/- 10.8 (n=10), 42.3 +/- 18.4% (n=10) and 90.4 +/- 2.9% (n=9), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The injury ratios in sECS and rECS groups were lower than the ratio in control group (p&lt;0.01), while the ratios of sECS and rECS groups were not different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The pyramidal cells in sham group were intact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that both preconditionings of sECS and rECS have a potency to induce delayed tolerance against temporary forebrain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, though the potency was not different between sECS and rECS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Electroconvulsive shock may be added to the list of preconditioning stimuli to protect brain against ischemic neuronal damage </plain></SENT>
