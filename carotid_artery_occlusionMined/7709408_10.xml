<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Atherosclerotic plaques in extracranial carotid arteries, particularly in the bifurcation of the common carotid and internal carotid arteries, may cause transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> by lumen stenosis or plaque-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>B-mode ultrasound imaging has the capability of providing information on plaque thickness, characteristics, and location in carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 242 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and 336 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>) patients, recruited for the B-Scan Ultrasound Imaging Assessment Program, was performed to determine the ultrasonographic correlates of carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A matched case-control study design was used to compare brain hemispheres with ischemic lesions ("cases") to unaffected contralateral hemispheres ("controls") with regard to the presence and characteristics of carotid artery plaques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The first set of analyses examined the association between the presence of carotid plaques ipsilateral to the brain lesion and the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> and showed an association with recent episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (odds ratio [OR], 1.6; P = .03) but not with past episodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a subset (n = 232) of patients with plaques in both carotid arteries and recent cerebral ischemic events, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was associated with ipsilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (P = .02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Lumen measurements at the site of the minimum residual lumen (MRL) diameter showed a significant association between a narrower lumen diameter in the carotid artery ipsilateral to case hemisphere and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (difference, 1.0 mm; P = .0003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> patients showed an association between both hypoechoic carotid plaques (OR, 3.0; P = .005) and the presence of longitudinal lesion motion (OR, 3.0; P = .02) with ipsilateral brain involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Plaque thickness at the MRL was positively correlated with both ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> (ipsilateral side, 4.4 +/- 0.15 mm; contralateral side, 3.9 +/- 0.16 mm; P = .007) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (ipsilateral side, 4.2 +/- 0.23 mm; contralateral side, 3.3 +/- 0.21 mm; P = .0006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate significant relationships between carotid artery ultrasound plaque characteristics and ischemic cerebrovascular events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings encourage further prospective studies in asymptomatic subjects focused on echographic carotid plaque characteristics as predictors of subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
