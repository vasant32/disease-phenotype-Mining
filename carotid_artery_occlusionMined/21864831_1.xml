<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, in the present study, we investigated the alterations in oligodendrocytes (OLG), including oligodendrocytes progenitor cells (OPCs), myelin, and CD following <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SD rats were subjected to bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical staining was performed at 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12weeks after the induction of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> with anti-NG2 (OPCs), anti-GST-π (OLG), and anti-MBP antibodies in paramedian corpus callosum (CC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CD was assessed by the <z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water maze</z:mp> test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a significant decrease in the number of GST-π positive cells at 2weeks after the start of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> compared with that seen in the sham group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a significant increase of the number of NG2 positive cells at 4weeks in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> group compared with the sham group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the ischemic group, the amount of MBP was observed to have decreased significantly at each time point compared with the sham group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CD was observed in the ischemic group than that in the sham group at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> time points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that remyelination is strongly correlated with the recovery of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0338656" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">cognitive dysfunction</z:e> following <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
