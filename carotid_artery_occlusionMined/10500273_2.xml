<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to investigate patterns of cerebrovascular reactivity in patients with internal carotid occlusion and severe contralateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> and their relationship with symptomatology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using transcranial Doppler ultrasound, cerebrovascular reactivity to <z:mp ids='MP_0002318'>hypercapnia</z:mp> in middle cerebral arteries was evaluated with the breath-holding index (BHI) in 42 patients with internal carotid occlusion and severe contralateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> and in 40 control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A significant decrease of BHI on the occluded side was observed in symptomatic patients with respect to asymptomatic ones (0.12+/-0.1 vs. 0.75+/-0.4, P&lt;0.0001) and with respect to the control group (1.11+/-0.1, P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The difference was also significant between asymptomatic patients and controls (P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Breath-holding values on the stenotic side were significantly higher (P&lt;0.0001) in asymptomatic patients (1.01+/-0.2) with respect to symptomatic ones (0.39+/-0.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A significant difference (P&lt;0.0001) was also present between controls and symptomatic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The pattern of cerebrovascular reactivity in patients with severe bilateral carotid steno-occlusive disease seems to be strictly dependent on the presence of previous symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed to investigate whether the study of cerebral hemodynamics in patients with bilateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery disease</z:e> is important for planning therapeutic strategies </plain></SENT>
