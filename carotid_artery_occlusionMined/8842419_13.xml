<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The neuroprotective properties of fasudil (HA1077), a novel <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37699">protein kinase inhibitor</z:chebi>, were evaluated in two animal models of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e>: transient bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in Mongolian gerbils and cerebral microembolization in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cytoprotective effect of fasudil on delayed neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in gerbils was compared with the effects of nimodipine, a calcium channel <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> and ozagrel, a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15627">thromboxane A2</z:chebi> synthetase inhibitor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The average of the neuronal cell density in the ischaemic control group was 17.8 +/- 2.1 cells mm-1, whereas fasudil (30 mg kg-1) significantly diminished the loss of CA1 neurones with the average of the neuronal cell density of 101.0 +/- 22.0 cells mm-1; nimodipine (10 mg kg-1) and ozagrel (30 mg kg-1) did not significantly protect against the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the rat model, the effects of fasudil on the histological and neurological consequences of cerebral microembolization produced via the injection of microspheres were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four hours after the injection of microspheres into the internal carotid artery, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals in the control group showed typical symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neurological function was significantly improved in the fasudil-treated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the controls, the infarcted area in a cortical slice selected to include the hippocampal area was 0.25 +/- 0.01 cm2 (mean +/- s.e.mean) (43.9 +/- 2.4% of cortical section of the half hemisphere); the difference was significant compared to the mean area of 32.7 +/- 2.8 and 21.5 +/- 4.8% observed in rats treated with fasudil (3, 10 mg kg-1), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Fasudil (10 mg kg-1) significantly suppressed the increased water content in ischaemic brain tissues (saline-treated rats, 82.4 +/- 0.2% vs fasudil-treated rats, 81.0 +/- 0.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that: (i) various protein kinases are involved in the pathogenesis of ischaemic injury; and (ii) the inhibition of protein kinases may be efficacious in preventing neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, thus improving neurological function in the brain damage associated with ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
