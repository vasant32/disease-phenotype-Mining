<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We imposed a permanent, bilateral occlusion of the common carotid arteries of rats (n=18) to create <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1695782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral hypoperfusion</z:e> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sham-operated animals (n=18) served as control for the surgery, while nontreated rats were used as control for the treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three months after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1695782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral hypoperfusion</z:e>, the rats were tested in a hippocampus-related learning paradigm, the <z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water maze</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, the animals were sacrificed and neurons, astrocytes and microglia were labeled with immunocytochemistry in the dorsal hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DMSO and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4495">diazoxide</z:chebi> dissolved in DMSO restored <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1695782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral hypoperfusion</z:e>-related learning dysfunction and prevented cyclooxygenase-2-positive neuron loss in the dentate gyrus </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Microglia activation was considerably enhanced by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1695782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral hypoperfusion</z:e>, which was completely prevented by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4495">diazoxide</z:chebi> dissolved in DMSO, but not by DMSO alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4495">diazoxide</z:chebi> can moderate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-related neuroinflammation by suppressing microglial activation </plain></SENT>
