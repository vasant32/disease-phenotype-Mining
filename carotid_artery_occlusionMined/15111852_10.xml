<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Carotid angioplasty and stenting has been proposed as a treatment option for carotid occlusive disease in patients at high risk, including those 80 years of age or older or with contralateral carotid occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analyzed 30-day mortality and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk rates of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in patients aged 80 years or older with concurrent carotid occlusive disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From a retrospective review of 1000 patients undergoing 1150 CEA procedures to treat symptomatic and asymptomatic carotid lesions over 13 years, we identified 54 patients (5.4%) aged 80 years or older with concurrent contralateral carotid occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These patients were compared with 38 patients (3.8%) aged 80 years or older with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or diseased patent contralateral carotid artery and 81 patients (8.1%) younger than 80 years with contralateral carotid occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> CEA procedures involved either standard CEA with patching or eversion CEA, and were performed by the same surgeon, with the patients under deep general anesthesia and cerebral protection involving continuous perioperative electroencephalographic monitoring for selective shunting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Shunting criteria were based exclusively on electroencephalographic abnormalities consistent with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The 30-day mortality and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate in patients aged 80 years or older with concurrent contralateral carotid occlusion was zero </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The concept of high-risk CEA needs to be revisited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with two of the criteria considered high risk in the medical literature, that is, age 80 years or older and contralateral carotid occlusion, can undergo CEA with no greater risks or complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Until prospective randomized trials designed to evaluate the role of carotid angioplasty and stenting have been completed, CEA should remain the standard treatment in such patients </plain></SENT>
