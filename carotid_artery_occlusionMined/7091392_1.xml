<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Physiological interventions included lesions in the dorsolateral funiculus (DLF) of the spinal cord, myelotomy, arterial pressure changes, bilateral occlusion of the carotid arteries, and administration of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46631">clonidine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Multiunit activity at the T2 on T3 white ramus communicans was recorded on-line during rest and FN stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Descending sympathetic activity (averaging 3.5 m/s) in the DLF was increased in response to FN stimulation but was significantly reduced by ipsilateral and eliminated by bilateral FN lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When testing for the effects of baroreceptor reflexes on the sympathetic pathway <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8093">phenylephrine</z:chebi>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> decreased, but moderate <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> increased the amount of preganglionic activity at rest and during FN stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and simultaneous carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> the amount of sympathetic activity that could be evoked was comparable to that evoked during normotensive states </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="4" ids="46631">Clonidine</z:chebi> (IV) reduced the FN sympathoexcitation, but direct stimulation of the DLF indicated that <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46631">clonidine</z:chebi> had sympathoinhibitory activity at both medullary and spinal sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In summary, rostral FN primarily excited ipsilateral descending sympathetic pathways in DLF, and this sympathoexcitation was partially inhibited by baroreceptor intervention </plain></SENT>
