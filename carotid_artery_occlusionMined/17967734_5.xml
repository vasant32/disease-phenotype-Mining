<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the direct protective effect of DIAZ in different in vivo models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000546'>retinal degeneration</z:hpo> has not yet been shown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the neuroprotective role of this compound in two <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1519106" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">rodent model</z:e> systems: monosodium-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> (MSG)- and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (BCAO)-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000546'>retinal degeneration</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rats were subjected either to s.c </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MSG treatment on postnatal days 1, 5 and 9, or to BCAO at 2 months of age, followed by intravitreal DIAZ treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Histological examination was carried out 14 or 21 days after treatments, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MSG treatment destroyed almost the entire inner retina, with the inner nuclear and ganglion cell layers being fused </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DIAZ treatment significantly ameliorated the MSG-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000546'>retinal degeneration</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>BCAO led to a severe degeneration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> layers, and DIAZ proved to be protective also in this model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results may have clinical implications in reducing <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi>-induced excitotoxicity or ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000546'>retinal degeneration</z:hpo> in ophthalmic diseases </plain></SENT>
