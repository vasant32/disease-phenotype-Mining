<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For comparison we used the CBF data of 29 patients with the same diseases who had had conservative treatment for a variable period of time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CBF was measured during rest and after the intravenous administration of 1 g <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During rest we found a significant interhemispheric difference in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After activation with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> this difference disappeared in the bypass group, but not in the conservatively treated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our data show that the bypass procedure obviously affects the vascular reserve capacity in a positive way over a long period of time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One criteria for success of STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> procedures might be the cerebral reserve capacity tested with CBF-studies under activation </plain></SENT>
