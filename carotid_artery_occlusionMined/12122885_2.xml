<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of orthostatic <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29191">(OH)</z:chebi> and postprandial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> (PPH) in Dutch elderly patients admitted to a medical ward and to explore patient characteristics associated with OH and PPH: symptoms, medications and comorbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied 50 patients, mean age 78.8 years, 68% female </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001278'>Orthostatic hypotension</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29191">(OH)</z:chebi> was defined as a decrease of systolic blood pressure (BP) &gt; or = 20 or diastolic &gt; or = 10 mm Hg after 3 minutes of standing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To diagnose postprandial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> (PPH) BP was measured sitting before and 30 minutes after the start of patient's noon meal, the same criteria were applied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We registered changes in BP, pulse rate, complaints, reason for hospitalization, medication and comorbidity: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and Parkinson(ism) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found OH in 24% of the patients, PPH was diagnosed more frequently: in 34% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>10% had both, but there were no relations between OH and PPH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In none of the patients OH and PPH were measured before our assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Pulse rate increased respectively 8 and 3/min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>With OH and PPH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Both subjective and objective complaints were significantly associated with OH, where as only subjective non-specific complaints were associated with PPH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Objective complaints were very rare in PPH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>OH and PPH were not significantly associated with medication use and comorbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>PPH and OH are common in hospitalized elderly patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>OH is more often symptomatic than PPH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>We found no relationship with medication use or comorbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>According to research literature, however, OH and PPH are associated with higher morbidity, mortality and possibly <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Therapeutic measures must be considered, especially in the presence of comorbidity such as significant carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
