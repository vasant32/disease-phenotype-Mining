<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Substance P (SP) is released from the feline nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) in response to activation of skeletal muscle afferent input </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there are differing results about SP release from the rostral NTS in response to baroreceptor afferent input </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An anti-sense oligonucleotide to feline SP (SP-asODN) was injected directly into the rostral NTS of chloralose-anesthetized cats to determine whether blood pressure or heart rate responses to ergoreceptor activation (muscle contraction) or baroreceptor unloading (carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>) were sensitive to SP knockdown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Control injections included either buffer alone or a scrambled-sequenced oligonucleotide (SP-sODN) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both muscle contractions and carotid occlusions were performed 3, 6 and 12 h after the completion of the oligonucleotide injections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cardiovascular responses to contractions were significantly attenuated 3 and 6 h after SP-asODN, but not by the injection of the SP-sODN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cardiovascular responses to contractions returned to control levels 12 h post anti-sense injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No detectable release of SP (using antibody-coated microprobes) was measured 3 and 6 h after SP-asODN injections and the expression of SP-immunoreactivity (SP-IR) in the NTS was significantly attenuated, as determined by immunohistochemistry procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, neither the injection of SP-asODN nor the s-ODN attenuated the cardiovascular responses to carotid occlusions, or altered the pattern of release of SP from the brainstem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Injection of the SP-sODN did not affect the expression of SP-IR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the SP involved with mediating the peripheral somatomotor signal input to the rostral NTS comes from SP-containing neurons within the NTS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our results also suggest that SP in the rostral NTS does not play a direct role in mediating the cardiovascular responses to unloading the carotid baroreceptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We suggest that the SP released during isometric contractions excites an inhibitory pathway modulating baroreceptor input, thus contributing to the increase in mean blood pressure </plain></SENT>
