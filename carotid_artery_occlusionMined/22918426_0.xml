<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our goal was to examine whether CAS improves cerebral hemodynamics on the treated side and on the side of the ICA occlusion, on the basis of measurement of CBF and CVR by using SPECT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The subjects were 8 patients who underwent contralateral CAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Resting CBF and CVR to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> were measured by using (123)I-<z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi> SPECT before and chronically (3-6 months) after CAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Resting CBF was also measured immediately (&lt;2 hours) after CAS by using (123)I-<z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi> SPECT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in resting CBF in both hemispheres immediately after CAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, resting CBF and CVR both significantly increased in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> period in both hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Contralateral CAS in patients with ICA occlusion resulted in cerebral hemodynamic improvement on the treated side and on the side of ICA occlusion </plain></SENT>
