<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In early stages (up to 2 h), the only enzyme affected was the phosphorylase which revealed a decreased activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thereafter, the observed changes inclusive of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> and other enzymes such as the dehydrogenase, nonspecific acid and alkaline phosphatases, leucine aminopeptidase and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="26948,33283">thiamine</z:chebi> pyrophosphatase progressed proportionally to the duration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was an overall inverse appearance of histochemically demonstrated enzymatic disturbances between the severely damaged ischemic regions and its marginal zones; the former revealing a conspicuous decrease and/or loss of enzymatic activities while the latter showing an increase of the same enzymes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Correlating the various ischemic responses of the intracellular organelles it appears that the changes in the lysosomes and Golgi apparatus occurred slower than those of mitochondria </plain></SENT>
