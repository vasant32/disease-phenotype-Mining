<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that WM injury as seen on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) would correlate with regions of increased MMP activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MRI was performed 3 days after BCAO surgery in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Apparent diffusion coefficients (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>) were calculated and vascular permeability was quantified by the multiple-time graphical analysis (MTGA) method, using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30629">diethylenetriamine</z:chebi> pentaacid (Gd-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35739">DTPA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After MRI, one group of animals had <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi> permeability measured in the WM with (14)C-<z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi>, and another had Evans blue (EB) injected for fluorescent microscopy for MMP-2, MMP-9, tight junction proteins (TJPs), and in situ zymography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found that <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> values were increased in WM in BCAO rats compared with controls (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>WM with increased <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> had leakage of EB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity on in situ zymograms corresponded with leakage of EB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although increased permeability to EB could be visualized, permeability quantification with (14)C-<z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi> and Gd-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35739">DTPA</z:chebi> failed to show increases and TJPs were intact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We propose that increased <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>, which is a marker of vasogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>, is related to activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>MRI provides unique information that can be used to guide tissue studies of WM injury </plain></SENT>
