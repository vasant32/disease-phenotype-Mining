<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Brain injury was induced in near-term fetal sheep by 30 minutes of bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ninety minutes after the occlusion, fetuses were given, intracerebroventricularly, either a single dose of IGF-1 (either 3 or 30 micro g), or 3 micro g followed by 3 micro g over 24 hours (3 + 3 micro g) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>White matter was assessed 4 days after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three micrograms, but not 30 micro g of IGF-1 prevented loss of oligodendrocytes and myelin basic protein density (P &lt; 0.001) compared to the vehicle-treated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No additional effect was observed in the 3 + 3 micro g group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>IGF-1 treatment was associated with reduced caspase-3 activation and increased glial proliferation in a similar dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Caspase-3 was only expressed in oligodendrocytes that showed apoptotic <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Proliferating cell nuclear antigen co-localized with both oligodendrocytes and astrocytes and microglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, <z:mp ids='MP_0010160'>increased oligodendrocyte numbers</z:mp> after IGF-1 treatment is partly due to suppression of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, and partly to increased proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the increase in reactive glia was related only to proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Speculatively, reactive glia may partly mediate IGF-1 white matter protection </plain></SENT>
