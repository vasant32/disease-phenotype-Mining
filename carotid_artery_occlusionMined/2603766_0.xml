<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Late neurological symptomatology after surgery was referable to the side of stenosis in 13% and to the side of occlusion in 9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The authors consider that, in cases of significant stenosis (greater than 70%) of an internal carotid artery with a contralateral occlusion, preference should always be given to end-arterectomy of the stenotic side, reserving extra-intracranial by-pass of the occluded side for patients who remain symptomatic after endarterectomy of the stenotic side </plain></SENT>
