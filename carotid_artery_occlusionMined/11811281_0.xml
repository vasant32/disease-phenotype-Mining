<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 37 patients with signs of transitory ischemic attack and in 5 patients with reversible ischemic neurologic deficit we compared the findings of three-dimensional ultrasonography of carotid arteries on the neck with those of three-dimensional CT angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 20 of these patients in which carotid thrombendarterectomy had been carried out, the findings of both diagnostic methods were also compared with the angiographic and operative findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 2 out of the total of 42 compared findings of three-dimensional ultrasonography, three-dimensional CT angiography and angiography of the carotid trunk, we assessed a difference in the evaluation of the degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> while <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other findings were in accordance as regards the evaluation of the degree of stenosis and plaque analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of 20 operative findings, one showed insignificant deviations from the findings of both diagnostic methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is our opinion that three-dimensional ultrasonography is a reliable diagnostic method in evaluating atherosclerotic stenoses of carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Every subtotal stenosis or internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> established by three-dimensional ultrasonography must be compared with three-dimensional CT angiography or classic angiography due to the objective possibility of false ultrasonographic interpretation and the significance of carotid thrombendarterectomy </plain></SENT>
