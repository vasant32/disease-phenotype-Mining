<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study investigated the distribution of platelet activating factor (PAF) binding sites in the brain and their involvement in global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in a model of bilateral common carotid occlusion in the gerbil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In sagittal sections of gerbil brain, labeling with [3H]PAF was mainly located in the cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The corpus striatum, the superior and inferior colliculi showed lower binding, while the thalamus was only weakly labeled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Scatchard analysis of the data obtained from displacement curves with unlabeled PAF revealed the presence of one or two populations of binding sites with different affinity constant values depending on the brain structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When the gerbils were submitted to 10 min <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, similar autoradiography with [3H]PAF demonstrated a dramatic reduction of labeling in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> brain structures, particularly in the hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunoreactive endogenous PAF concentrations in brain tissues showed a marked increase in ischemic animals: (8977.3 +/- 1113 pg/g wet weight) as compared to sham-operated control: (997.7 +/- 77 pg/g wet weight) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Endogenous PAF levels returned to basal values following 30 min reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that PAF may be involved in the early stages of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> in the gerbil and suggest that endogenous PAF produced during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> may contribute to the down-regulation of [3H]PAF binding sites in the brain </plain></SENT>
