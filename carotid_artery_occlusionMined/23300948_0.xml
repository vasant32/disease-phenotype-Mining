<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analyzed long-term effects of intranasal MSC treatment on lesion size, sensorimotor and cognitive behavior, and determined the therapeutic window and dose response relationships </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the appearance of MSCs at the lesion site in relation to the therapeutic window was examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nine-day-old mice were subjected to unilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MSCs were administered intranasally at 3, 10 or 17 days after <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (HI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Motor, cognitive and histological outcome was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PKH-26 labeled cells were used to localize MSCs in the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We identified 0.5Ã—10(6) MSCs as the minimal effective dose with a therapeutic window of at least 10 days but less than 17 days post-HI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A single dose was sufficient for a marked beneficial effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MSCs reach the lesion site within 24 h when given 3 or 10 days after injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, no MSCs were detected in the lesion when administered 17 days following HI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We also show for the first time that intranasal MSC treatment after HI improves cognitive function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Improvement of sensorimotor function and histological outcome was maintained until at least 9 weeks post-HI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The capacity of MSCs to reach the lesion site within 24 h after intranasal administration at 10 days but not at 17 days post-HI indicates a therapeutic window of at least 10 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Our data strongly indicate that intranasal MSC treatment may become a promising non-invasive therapeutic tool to effectively reduce neonatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
