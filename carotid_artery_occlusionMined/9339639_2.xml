<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated rapid changes in pial arterial diameter and in cerebral blood flow (CBF) caused by transient ipsilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (CCA-O) in anesthetized rats in order to elucidate how the cerebral circulation reacts to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> stem <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In separate groups of rats, pial arterial diameter was recorded through a closed cranial window and CBF was recorded by laser-Doppler flowmetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CCA-O was performed for 5 minutes under normotension and normocapnia (control) and under graded <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002318'>hypercapnia</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0003032'>hypocapnia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the control condition, pial arterial diameter increased rapidly, triggered by CCA-O </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It took 12 +/- 3 s to reach the maximum of 204 +/- 42% of the value before CCA-O, and 60 +/- 24 s to become stable at 131 +/- 11% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CBF decreased rapidly to 66 +/- 11%, then increased reactively to 135 +/- 9%, and again decreased to 91 +/- 3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The reactive increase in CBF caused by CCA-O decreased in parallel with the degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo>, and also became barely detectable under <z:mp ids='MP_0002318'>hypercapnia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that active <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0679405" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular dilation</z:e> in the territory of the occluded artery is important for inducing collateral circulation </plain></SENT>
