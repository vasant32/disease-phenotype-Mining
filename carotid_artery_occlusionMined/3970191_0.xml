<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The effects of short- or long-term complete <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> were studied in the gerbil brain using a multi-parameter monitoring system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Metabolic (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16908">NADH</z:chebi> redox state) and hemodynamic responses were monitored by surface fluorometry-reflectometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ionic activities (K+ and pH) were measured by surface macroelectrodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Electrical activity was evaluated by monitoring the general electrocorticogram (ECoG) as well as local DC steady potential (two sites) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two groups of gerbils were studied to compare the effects of 4-5 min occlusions with those of 30 min complete <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> the cortex is exposed to complete <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> resulting in the complete <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of O2 with attendant maximal reduction of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16908">NADH</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Extracellular K+ began to increase as soon as energy reserves were decreased with a time course suggesting two different kinetic areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Surface pH decreased very shortly after the occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During the recovery phase, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16908">NADH</z:chebi> was reoxidized soon after recirculation, whereas the pH and K+ recovery showed a short delay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>ECoG did not recover even when <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other parameters reached base-line levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The recovery of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the measured parameters was correlated to the duration of the ischemic insult; i.e., the recovery from 30 min of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> took significantly longer than after 5 min of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We conclude that pH recovery depends on recirculation and adequate O2 supply to the tissue, whereas K+ recovery required not only an adequate O2 supply but also the integrity of the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> triphosphatase system </plain></SENT>
