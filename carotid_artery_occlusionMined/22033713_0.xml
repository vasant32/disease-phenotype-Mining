<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rupture generally leads to carotid cavernous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> and, rarely, to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study we report results of treatment in 85 patients with 86 cavernous sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a 15-year period, 85 patients with 86 cavernous sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were 77 women (91%) and 8 men, with a mean age of 55.5 years (range 26-78 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Presentation was <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010266" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cranial neuropathy</z:e> in 56, carotid cavernous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> in 8, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> in 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment was selective coiling in 31 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> and carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in 55 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, 5 after bypass surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 8 cavernous sinus <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistulas</z:mpath> were closed with coils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no complications of coiling and 1 patient had a permanent neurologic complication after carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (morbidity 1.2%; 95% confidence interval, 0.01 to 6.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Clinical and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging follow-up ranged from 3 months to 12 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In 52 of 56 (93%) patients presenting with symptoms of mass effect, symptoms either were cured (n = 23) or improved (n = 29) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were thrombosed after carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and at latest <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging, 34 of 50 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> (68%) were substantially decreased in size or completely obliterated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this series, for patients with cavernous sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, a treatment strategy including selective coiling and carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was safe and effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Most symptomatic patients (93%) were improved or cured, and most <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> (68%) shrank on follow-up </plain></SENT>
