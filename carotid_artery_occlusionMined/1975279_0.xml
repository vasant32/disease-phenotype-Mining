<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We examined the characteristics of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-induced behavioral deficit in the passive avoidance task and the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51038">minaprine</z:chebi> and other cytoprotective drugs on passive avoidance deficit induced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in Mongolian gerbils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Severe impairment of passive avoidance was apparent when the duration of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> exceeded 2 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Histopathological ischemic neuronal damage in CA1 neurons at 7 days after occlusion was also induced when the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was over 2 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Otherwise, although <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was carried out at 5 min, 2 hr, 5 hr or 24 hr after the training session, the passive avoidance deficit was produced 24 hr after the training session </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When the training session was carried out 24 hr before the occlusion, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51038">minaprine</z:chebi>, which was administered 30 min before the occlusion, led to a recovery of the response latency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="7983">Pentobarbital</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="11" ids="49575">diazepam</z:chebi> and ethylapovincamine improved the passive avoidance deficit induced by 5-min bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the passive avoidance deficit was not ameliorated by Ca(++)-hopantenate, nicardipine and idebenone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The hippocampal damage at 7 days after occlusion was prevented by the drugs that ameliorated the passive avoidance deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The relationship between passive avoidance deficit and CA1 neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in the hippocampus induced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> warrants further attention </plain></SENT>
