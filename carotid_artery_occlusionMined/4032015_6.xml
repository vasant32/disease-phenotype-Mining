<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The results of superficial temporal to middle cerebral artery bypass surgery for bilateral internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> were reviewed in 39 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Preoperative symptoms included recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>'s) in 31 patients (80%) and mild or moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in 15 (29%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Deficits were unilateral in 23 cases and bilateral in 14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>Dementia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000751'>personality changes</z:hpo> were observed in 19 patients (49%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Operative morbidity occurred in six of 39 cases and was neurological in one; the surgical mortality rate was 8% (three of 39 patients), including two cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The outcome was good or excellent (relief of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>'s and reduction of neurological deficit) in 82% of patients over a follow-up period of 3 to 139 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five patients had a late postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, which occurred in the unoperated hemisphere in each case; one patient had an ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> 6 years after the bypass procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that an extracranial-intracranial arterial bypass procedure to augment collateral cerebral blood flow can be performed safely in patients with bilateral internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and may be associated with relief of ischemic symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Future studies may document a role for this procedure in the prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
