<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>UNLABELLED: In patients with head and neck <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> and extensive cervical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e>, the topographic and functional relationship of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> to the carotid artery is highly important </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In case of suspected carotid infiltration, the possibility of a carotid resection or a prosthetic replacement has to be considered preoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Treatment of cavernous carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> may also require sacrificing the internal carotid artery (ICA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An interdisciplinary test occlusion of the ICA was performed to assess cerebral collateral circulation prior to permanent carotid occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-two patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007873" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cervical tumors</z:e> (n = 45) or inoperable <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> (n = 7) were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The endovascular balloon test occlusion (BTO) of the ICA was combined with monitoring of the neurological status, cardiovascular status (EKG, blood pressure), cortical function (EEG), and single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission CT (SPECT) imaging of the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) with 99mTechnetium-HMPAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the last 24 patients, transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD) of the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) was added for direct hemodynamic monitoring during BTO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In order to improve the diagnostic value of the test results and to simulate hemodynamic crisis, the cerebrovascular reserve capacity was then evaluated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690,31163">Diamox</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: BTO could be performed without neurological complications or carotid dissection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In eight (15%) patients BTO had to be interrupted previously due to neurological symptoms or a delta-EEG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These patients and patients with highly pathological test results in SPECT imaging (n = 9) or TCD (n = 3) were excluded from permanent carotid occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Ten (19%) patients were definitely occluded without hemodynamic complications, but two patients suffered <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0264978" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">embolic infarctions</z:e>, which can not be predicted by this procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In two patients with a severe hypoperfusion in SPECT imaging, the ICA had to be ligated under emergency conditions following a carotid rupture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Predictably, a hemodynamic infarction occurred postoperatively in both patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The multimodal BTO with brain perfusion imaging (HMPAO-SPECT) and quantitative blood flow monitoring (TCD) allows a hemodynamic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk assessment prior to permanent occlusion of the ICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The procedure is important for planning of the therapeutic strategy and for the preoperative dialogue with the patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Embolic ischemic complications can not be predicted </plain></SENT>
