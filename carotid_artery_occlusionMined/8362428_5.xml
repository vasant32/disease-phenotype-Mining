<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe four cases of de novo genesis of subcortical hyperintense lesions in patients undergoing controlled therapeutic internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, and we speculate on associated pathophysiological mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twelve consecutive patients underwent controlled therapeutic internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> for symptomatic giant <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysm</z:hpo> using the detachable balloon technique under full anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Preocclusion (within 2 weeks) and postocclusion (within 6 weeks) magnetic resonance imaging of the brain was performed in eight cases and evaluated for preexisting and new appearance of subcortical hyperintense lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were four instances of de novo genesis of subcortical hyperintense lesions after carotid occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>New subcortical hyperintense lesions were ipsilateral to carotid occlusion in every instance and in two cases were associated with ipsilateral hemispheric ischemic symptoms despite <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In one instance, there were transient hemispheric symptoms without the appearance of new subcortical hyperintense lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Age, vascular risk factors, and preexisting subcortical hyperintense lesions did not appear to predispose patients to de novo genesis of new hyperintensities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This is the first documentation of de novo genesis of subcortical hyperintense lesions in a controlled setting of hemodynamic ischemic insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic and asymptomatic lesions can be detected in this setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Anticoagulation does not appear to provide protection from this phenomenon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Careful prospective studies are required to further evaluate risk factors and possible clinical consequences associated with the genesis of new subcortical hyperintense lesions </plain></SENT>
