<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By the Transcranial Doppler sonographic technique (TCD) blood flow velocity as a correlate of flow volume can be measured within the great basal intracranial arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated 8 patients with an internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> or high-grade stenosis and 5 cerebrovascular diseased patients without extracranial stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>12 healthy volunteers and patients without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> served as the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Blood flow velocities in the middle cerebral arteries were evaluated before and after 5 minutes of breathing a 5% <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> gas mixture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a prestudy the end tidal pCO2 was monitored during this procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As a result of the close parallelity of pCO2 increase in the prestudy group we planned to standardize the <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> reactivity tests without consideration of the individual pCO2 values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> inhalation provoked a flow velocity increase of at least 20% in the control subjects (47.1 +/- 17.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The vascular diseased without extracranial stenosis responded with 34.8 +/- 17.4% (minimum: 23.5%, n. s.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> reactivity in cases of occlusion or greater than 50% stenosis was significantly decreased (p less than 0.001) both when considering only the affected sides (12.4 +/- 7.5%, maximum: 20%) and when including the non affected sides (22.6 +/- 15.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> reactivity test is a simple and valid method to evaluate the cerebrovascular reserve capacity in any case of uncertainty about the benefits of surgical treatment of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In future this technique might become one fundamental argument beside others in selecting adequate treatment </plain></SENT>
