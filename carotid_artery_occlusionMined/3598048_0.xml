<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nine male Rhesus monkeys were chronically instrumented to measure arterial pressure and aortic blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aortic arch was denervated at the time of surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (BCO) was used to elicit the carotid sinus reflex both before and after 25% plasma volume expansion with an iso-osmotic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52071">dextran</z:chebi> solution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The BCO elicited significant increases in heart rate (HR, 29.8 +/- 5.3 bpm) mean arterial pressure (MAP, 55.0 +/- 8.2 mm Hg) and total peripheral resistance (TPR, 0.076 +/- 0.01 mm Hg/ml/min) coupled with a significant reduction in mean aortic flow (AF, -246.9 +/- 55.3 ml/min) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> volume (SV, -2.86 +/- 0.36 ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Volume expansion significantly attenuated the HR (15.2 +/- 5.8 bpm), MAP (30.4 +/- 4.4 mm Hg) and TPR (0.036 +/- 0.006 mm Hg/ml/min) response to carotid sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The changes in mean AF and SV elicited by BCO, however, were not significantly different between the control and volume expansion conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that plasma volume expansion significantly attenuates the baroreceptor reflex control of circulation with a similar reduction in both the peripheral resistance and heart rate components of the response </plain></SENT>
