<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Transient global <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> (20 min), followed by 24 h of reperfusion, significantly promoted the generation of nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) and malondialdehyde (<z:chebi fb="14" ids="32506">MDA</z:chebi>) in cortical microvascular homogenates, as well as markedly reduced the activities of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (SOD) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> peroxidase (GSH-px) and promoted the activity of nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (NOs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Reperfusion for 24 h led to serous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> with substantial microvilli loss, vacuolation, membrane damage and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> injuries in cortical microvascular endothelial cells (CMEC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, enhanced phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and decreased expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) were detected in cortical microvessels after I (20 min)/R (24 h) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Reperfusion for 24 h also induced membrane (functional) G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) expression, while it reduced cytosol GRK2 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment with crocin markedly inhibited oxidizing reactions and modulated the ultrastructure of CMEC in mice with 20 min of bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (BCCAO) followed by 24 h of reperfusion in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, crocin inhibited GRK2 translocation from the cytosol to the membrane and reduced ERK1/2 phosphorylation and MMP-9 expression in cortical microvessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We propose that crocin protects the brain against excessive <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and constitutes a potential therapeutic candidate in transient global <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
