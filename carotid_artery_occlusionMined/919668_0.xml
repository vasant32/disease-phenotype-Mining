<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The investigation thereafter, whether or not these attacks were symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005296'>occlusive vascular disease</z:hpo> of the carotid arteries, included a thorough physical and angiological examination, ophthalmodynamometry (ODM), ophthalmodynamography (ODG), and radionuclide angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results were compared to those of a group of 46 cardiac pacemaker patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncopes</z:hpo> after the implantation of the pacemaker: 29% of the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncopes</z:hpo> and 15% of the patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncopes</z:hpo> showed ODM-, ODG-, and radionuclide angiography results compatible with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1401054" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery insufficiency</z:e>; statistically, however, the group differences were insignificant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The reasons are discussed why ODM, ODG, and radionuclide angiography appear to be ineffective for the diagnosis of carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in patients with an implanted cardiac pacemaker </plain></SENT>
