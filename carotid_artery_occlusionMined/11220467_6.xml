<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To report the results of carotid artery stenting (CAS) in patients considered to have high-risk anatomical characteristics for carotid endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: CAS was performed in 39 carotid arteries of 37 consecutive patients (26 men; mean age 72 +/- 8 years, range 56-88) who met the criteria for high-risk surgical <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp>: previous ipsilateral carotid endarterectomy (20/39, 51.3%), common carotid bifurcation above the mandibular angle (5/39, 12.8%), contralateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (15/39, 38.5%), or previous radiation therapy to the neck (1/39, 2.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Palmaz, Integra, or Wallstents were deployed via a percutaneous femoral artery access </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Independent neurological evaluation was performed at specified time points, and a dedicated committee adjudicated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> clinical events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Procedural success was 100%, with no major in-hospital complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neurological events were rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only 1 (2.6%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> occurred prior to discharge; at 30 days, 1 (2.6%) additional minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> had been observed, giving a 2.6% cumulative 30-day "<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> plus any <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>" rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Over a mean 11 +/- 6-month follow-up, 2 (5.4%) patients died of nonneurological causes, but there were no <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CAS is a viable endovascular revascularization technique that can be performed safely and effectively in patients with high-risk <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> for carotid endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
