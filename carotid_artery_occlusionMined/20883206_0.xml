<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previously it has been demonstrated that protein-energy <z:hpo ids='HP_0004395'>malnutrition</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="53221">PEM</z:chebi>) impairs <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013170" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">habituation</z:e> in the open field test following global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study examined the hypothesis that <z:chebi fb="3" ids="53221">PEM</z:chebi> exerts some of its deleterious effects on functional outcome by altering the post-ischemic expression of the plasticity-associated genes brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), its receptor tropomyosin-related kinase B (trkB), and growth-associated protein-43 (GAP-43) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Male, Mongolian gerbils (11-12 wk) were randomized to either control diet (12.5% protein) or <z:chebi fb="3" ids="53221">PEM</z:chebi> (2% protein) for 4 wk, and then underwent 5 min bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> or sham surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Tympanic temperature was maintained at 36.5 ± 0.5°C during surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Brains collected at 1, 3 and 7 d post-surgery were processed by in-situ hybridization or immunofluorescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>BDNF and trkB <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was increased in hippocampal CA1 neurons after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> time points and was not significantly influenced by diet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, increased trkB protein expression after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was exacerbated by <z:chebi fb="3" ids="53221">PEM</z:chebi> at 7 d in the CA1 region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Post-ischemic GAP-43 protein increased at 3 and 7 d in the CA1 region, and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="53221">PEM</z:chebi> intensified this response and extended it to the CA3 and hilar regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="53221">PEM</z:chebi> exerted these effects without exacerbating CA1 neuron loss caused by global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The findings suggest that <z:chebi fb="3" ids="53221">PEM</z:chebi> increases the stress response and/or hyper-excitability in the hippocampus after global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Nutritional care appears to have robust effects on plasticity mechanisms important to recovery after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
