<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: After the right common carotid artery had been ligated, rats were exsanguinated to maintain a mean arterial pressure of 35, 42, or 50 mm Hg (n=6, each group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Apparent diffusion coefficient (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>) maps were calculated from DWIs and lesion volume (area) was defined based on <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> values (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> lesion volume (area)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> lesion volume during exsanguination in the 35 mm Hg group (417 (111) mm(3), P&lt;0.01) was significantly larger than in the 42 mm Hg group (87 (84) mm(3)) and 50 mm Hg group (42 (58) mm(3)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The low relative cerebral blood flow area, calculated from PWI, was significantly larger during exsanguination in the 35 mm Hg group than in the other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> lesion volume in the six rats that died within 3 days of the MRI study was significantly larger (median 421 mm(3), range 205-476 mm(3), P&lt;0.005) than in the 12 rats that survived for 3 days (median 26 mm(3), range 3-517 mm(3)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Rats with an <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> lesion area over 14 mm(2) on the coronal slice including the caudate putamen during exsanguination died within 3 days or revealed a more severe histopathological outcome than those that survived for 3 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Incomplete <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> created by the combination of common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and exsanguination could be detected by DWI and PWI both qualitatively and quantitatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The size of the lesion on <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> mapping was found to correlate with mortality and outcome </plain></SENT>
