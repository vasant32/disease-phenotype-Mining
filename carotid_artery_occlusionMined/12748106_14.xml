<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Permanent balloon occlusion (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53450">PBO</z:chebi>) of the carotid artery has been previously shown to be an effective means to treat carotid blowout syndrome (CBS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, despite the effectiveness of this endovascular technique, concern remains regarding its potential for producing delayed cerebral ischemic complications in 15% to 20% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This significant limitation of carotid <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53450">PBO</z:chebi> led our group to evaluate an alternative management strategy, consisting of endovascular reconstruction of the carotid artery (ERCA) in patients thought to be at particularly high risk for carotid occlusion (ie, provocative balloon test occlusion, angiographic documented incomplete circle of Willis, or contralateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of CBS referred to our service, in which ERCA was chosen as a management strategy for patients thought to be at high risk for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53450">PBO</z:chebi>, based on previously defined criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixteen carotid blowout events occurred in 12 patients with CBS who were deemed to be at high risk for cerebral ischemic complications, which were managed with ERCA by using a variety of stent devices and techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Adjunctive embolization of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751816" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid pseudoaneurysms</z:e> was performed in five of these patients by using <z:chebi fb="240" ids="33364,33400">platinum</z:chebi> coils or acrylic glue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hemostasis was achieved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, although one patient with traumatic CBS and three patients with aggressive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278996" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">head and neck cancer</z:e>-related CBS, required retreatment with ERCA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Recurrent CBS rates were similar to those reported in other studies using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53450">PBO</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall, no treatment-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CBS managed with ERCA can be performed safely and with efficacy of outcomes at least equivalent to those previously reported in association with conventional carotid <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53450">PBO</z:chebi>, therefore representing an excellent alternative endovascular technique for patients who are at increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53450">PBO</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
