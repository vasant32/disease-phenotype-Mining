<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>[<z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>]butanol (4.5 mu Ci in 45 microliter 0.9% saline) was injected into the femoral vein, and cpm accumulating in the cerebrum and in a catheter inserted in the abdominal aorta were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CBF (ml/100 g/min, mean +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) in sham-operated control gerbils was 108.4 +/- 37.5 in the left hemisphere and 123.8 +/- 37.1 in the right </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CBF in the ischemic left cerebrum was 41.0 +/- 7.7 at 2 hours (n = 7), 21.6 +/- 7.2 at 4 hours (n = 4), 26.2 +/- 4.6 at 7 hours (n = 7), and 9.7 +/- 3.1 at 12 hours (n = 6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CBF in the nonligated right hemisphere was 115.0 +/- 15.3 at 2 hours, 70.4 +/- 23.3 at 4 hours, 80.4 +/- 14.6 at 7 hours, and 50.9 +/- 20.1 at 12 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As expected, CBF was significantly reduced in the ischemic left cerebral hemisphere compared with the nonligated right cerebral hemisphere at each time, but CBF in the ischemic left cerebral hemisphere was also significantly lower at 12 hours than at 2 hours (p = 0.002) and at 7 hours (p = 0.014) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CBF in the nonligated right cerebral hemisphere was also lower at 12 hours than at 2 hours (p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No changes in PCO2 or blood pressure accounted for these differences.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
