<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Wavelet-based neural network model, employing the multilayer perceptron, was used for analysis of the internal carotid arterial Doppler signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Multi-layer perceptron neural network (MLPNN) trained with the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm was used to detect stenosis and occlusion in internal carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In order to determine the MLPNN inputs, spectral analysis of the internal carotid arterial Doppler signals was performed using wavelet transform (WT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The MLPNN was trained, cross validated, and tested with training, cross validation, and testing sets, respectively </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The correct classification rate was 96% for healthy subjects, 96.15% for subjects having internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> and 96.30% for subjects having internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The classification results showed that the MLPNN trained with the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm was effective to detect internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> and occlusion </plain></SENT>
