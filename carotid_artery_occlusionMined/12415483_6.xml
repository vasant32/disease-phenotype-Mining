<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>EEG monitoring is measured by the intraoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Carotid stump pressure measurements were recorded as an additional observation in 1517 operations and represent a subset of the study group allowing comparison of this technique with EEG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intraoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate for the 1661 operations in the study group was 0.03% (five <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A statistically significant increase in intraoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate was associated with the development of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002353'>abnormal EEG</z:hpo> (1.1%), contralateral internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (1.8%), and the combination of both <z:hpo ids='HP_0002353'>abnormal EEG</z:hpo> and contralateral internal carotid occlusion (3.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The EEG remained <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in 1295 operations including 75 operations with contralateral internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One minor intraoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (0.08%) which resolved in 1 week occurred in the absence of an EEG change with no intraoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> in the 75 operations in which the contralateral internal carotid artery was occluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Intraoperative EEG monitoring accurately (99.92%) identified patients who may safely have carotid endarterectomy without the need of a shunt </plain></SENT>
