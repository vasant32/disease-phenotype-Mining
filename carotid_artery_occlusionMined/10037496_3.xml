<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Four animals were used for each reperfusion period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Based on the information from the immunohistochemical examination, we dissected out vulnerable and tolerant subregions of the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, and thalamus from freeze-dried 20-microm-thick sections, and measured the levels of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> phosphate (P-Cr), <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16708">adenine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="9" ids="36976">nucleotides</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16235">guanine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="9" ids="36976">nucleotides</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35584">purine</z:chebi> bodies by HPLC, and the levels of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> by an enzyme-immobilized column method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in the levels of metabolites between vulnerable and tolerant subregions of control brains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After reperfusion, both vulnerable and tolerant subregions recovered preischemic metabolic profiles by 2 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although the regional differences between vulnerable and tolerant subregions were minimal at each reperfusion period, there were delays in the recovery of P-Cr, ATP, and/or total <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16708">adenine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="9" ids="36976">nucleotides</z:chebi> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> vulnerable subregions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A decline of P-Cr, ATP, and <z:chebi fb="11" ids="15996">GTP</z:chebi> levels without change in %ATP, <z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi>, or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35584">purine</z:chebi> bodies occurred after reperfusion for 3 days, coinciding with the development of immunohistochemical damage by the immunoreaction for microtubule-associated protein 1A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results supported the notion that subtle but sustained impairment of energy metabolism caused by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> dysfunction in the early reperfusion period might trigger delayed neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in vulnerable subregions </plain></SENT>
