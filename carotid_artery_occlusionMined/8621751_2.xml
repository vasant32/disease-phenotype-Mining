<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The ischemic flow thresholds for reduction of the cAMP binding in the hippocampus CA1 were 18, 34, and 49 ml 100 g-1 min-1 after 30-min, 2-h, and 6-h <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These values were higher than those in other regions such as the hippocampus CA, and temporal cerebral cortex in each duration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that (a) the ischemic flow threshold for perturbation of the cAMP system may be higher in the hippocampus CA1 than in other brain regions, suggesting that the hippocampus CA1 could be especially vulnerable to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ischemic stress; and (b) the level of the aforementioned threshold may increase progressively during the time course of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in particular regions such as the hippocampus CA1 and CA3, suggesting that the duration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> exerts a definite influence on the viability of the ischemic neuronal cells in these regions </plain></SENT>
