<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Gerbils were treated intraperitoneally with NB-818 (0.1-3 mg/kg) just after release of the occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four days after the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, they were fixed by perfusing 10% buffered-formalin, and the neuronal cell density (NCD, cell/mm) in the CA1 subfield was estimated under microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The average NCD in the ischemic control group was 43 +/- 10.8 cells/mm, whereas NB-818 (3 mg/kg) significantly ameliorated DND with an average NCD of 143 +/- 24.2 cells/mm (P less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, NB-818 (3 mg/kg) significantly inhibited DND at 1, 2 and 4 weeks after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">transient ischemia</z:e>: the average NCD of the NB-818 and ischemic control groups were 80 +/- 9.4 (P less than 0.01) and 43 +/- 7.7 cells/mm, 92 +/- 13.7 (P less than 0.05) and 52 +/- 9.3 cells/mm, and 57 +/- 5.0 (P less than 0.01) and 43 +/- 12.4 cells/mm, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this experiment, NB-818 exhibited a protective effect on DND in the hippocampal CA1 subfield after transient forebrain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, and its effect persisted for up to 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that NB-818 may be useful for clinical treatment of neurological deficit after an ischemic insult </plain></SENT>
