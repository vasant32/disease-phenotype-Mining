<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (BCCAO) in adult rats has been used to study effects of oligemia (hypoperfusion) using neuropathological and neurochemical analysis as well as behavioral tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, BCCAO was induced for 1 week, or 2, 4, and 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sensitive immunohistochemistry with marker proteins was used to study reactions of astrocytes (GFAP, nestin), and lectin binding to study microglial cells during BCCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo> was visualized with NeuN antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Astrocytes reacted to changes in the optic tract at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> time points, and strong glial reactions also occurred in the target areas of <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> fibers, indicating damage to the retina and optic nerve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Astrocytes indicated a change in the corpus callosum from early to late time points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Diffuse increases in GFAP labeling occurred in parts of the neocortex after 1 week of BCCAO, in the absence of focal changes of neuronal marker proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant differences emerged in the cortex at longer time points </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Nestin labeling was elevated in the optic tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Reactions of microglia cells were seen in the cortex after 1 week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Measurements of the basilar artery indicated a considerable <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath>, indicative of macrovascular compensation in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> occlusion model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> BCCAO and, by inference, oligemia have a transient effect on the neocortex and a long-lasting effect on white matter structures </plain></SENT>
