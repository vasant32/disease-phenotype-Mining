<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The authors report the occurrence of ipsilateral transient <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271347" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cavernous sinus syndrome</z:e> during balloon test occlusion (BTO) of the cervical internal carotid artery (ICA) and discuss the involved pathomechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors reviewed their series of 129 BTOs of the ICA performed between 1989 and 1996 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two patients developed facial <z:hpo ids='HP_0003401'>paresthesias</z:hpo> and transient palsies of the third through sixth cranial nerves during test occlusion of the cervical ICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The tests were performed prior to planned permanent carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> for the treatment of a neck <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> in one patient and a giant cavernous carotid artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> in the other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients' symptoms resolved with deflation of the balloon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When the balloon was subsequently inflated above the inferior cavernous sinus artery (ICSA), one of the patients complained of mild facial discomfort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no contralateral <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> or mental status change during test occlusion in either patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Angiography demonstrated good filling of the ipsilateral intracranial circulation via collateral vessels of the circle of Willis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In these two cases, the cranial nerves in the cavernous sinus were likely supplied by the ICA via the meningohypophyseal trunk and the ICSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In each case, there was excellent blood supply to the ipsilateral cerebral hemisphere; however, there was probably inadequate retrograde filling of the cranial nerve collateral vessels located where the meningohypophyseal trunk and ICSA originated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These cases emphasize the importance of a patent external carotid artery-ICA connection for successful cervical carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Neurological examination during BTO was critical to interpret the clinical manifestations caused by the hemodynamic changes </plain></SENT>
