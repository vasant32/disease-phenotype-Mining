<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results were compared with those obtained in the group undergoing a blood loss and the group not subjected to surgical procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A significant increase in the frequency of emperipolesis was found in the bled rats following a carotid artery cannulation, but also in animals exposed to the carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In most cases the cytoplasm of megakaryocytes contained granulocytes and erythroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The observed emperipolesis phenomenon is likely to be a result of brain <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> and a secondary neurogenic stimulation of the bone marrow activity </plain></SENT>
