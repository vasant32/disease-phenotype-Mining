<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intra-ischemic electroencephalographic (EEG) changes, behavioral function (Days 5-7), and histologic injury (Day 7) were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Under similar conditions, cerebral blood flow was determined after 10 min <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> by the [3H]<z:chebi fb="164" ids="18723">nicotine</z:chebi> indicator fractionation technique </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The per cent of CA1 neurons counted as dead (left and right hemispheres combined) was significantly affected by intra-ischemic MAP (72, 46 and 28% in the 30 mmHg, 50 mmHg, and 60 mmHg groups, respectively; P less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
