<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (BCO), output (in ng/min) from right innervated gland of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28918">epinephrine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> increased from 86.6 +/- 33.0 and 34.4 +/- 15.1 to 280.8 +/- 86.7 (P less than 0.01, n = 7) and 104.4 +/- 40.6 (P less than 0.01, n = 7), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By contrast, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28918">epinephrine</z:chebi> output from left denervated gland increased only slightly (P less than 0.05), and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> did not increase significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Net <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi> output from left denervated gland was markedly attenuated by approximately 90% (P less than 0.01, n = 7) compared with that from right innervated gland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During BCO in the second group of dogs, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi> output from sham-denervated left gland increased significantly (P less than 0.01, n = 7) to an extent slightly lower than that observed in right innervated gland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the third group, intravenous injections of dimethylphenylpiperazinium (5 and 15 micrograms/kg) resulted in a dose-dependent increase (P less than 0.05, n = 7) in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi> output from both right innervated and left denervated gland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that the present procedure of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> surgical adrenal denervation can eliminate the centrally mediated adrenal response, whereas the medullary secretory response to blood-borne substances remains intact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This model may be a useful tool for studying neuronal and humoral medullary secretory functions in vivo under various experimentally induced stress conditions </plain></SENT>
