<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a total series of 1107 procedures, 834 were performed electively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During 1993 and 1994, an effort was made to contact and, if possible re-examine the 794 (95.2%) patients who survived these elective procedures in order to establish survival curves, determine the causes of late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, and ascertain the predictive value for long-term survival of 628 perioperative variables recorded in 1989 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Survival curves were calculated using the actuarial and Kaplan-Meier methods and compared with those obtained from national statistical records in a control population matched for age and sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Variables with potential predictive value for late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were selected by univariate statistical analysis using either the chi2 or student t-test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the group of 794 (92.5%) patients who survived elective AAA repair in 1989, survival rates were 93.9 +/- 1.8% at 1 year, 89.5 +/- 3.2% at 2 years, 83.5 +/- 3.2% at 3 years, 77.6 +/- 3.9% at 4 years, and 66.9 +/- 10.6% at 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These rates were significantly lower than those observed in the control population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean annual <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> was 1.8%, which was higher than in the control population matched for age and sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Analysis using the Cox proportional risk model showed that the following variables were significant, independent predictors of late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>: diameter of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> (p &lt; 0.02), choice of surgical approach in function of general status (p &lt; 0.02), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023212" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">left ventricular insufficiency</z:e> (p &lt; 0.02), age (p &lt; 0.02), carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (p &lt; 0.03), use of a surgical approach other than lobotomy (p &lt; 0.04), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>cardiac arrhythmia</z:hpo> (p &lt; 0.04), duration of aortic clamping (p &lt; 0.05), ECG evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">myocardial ischemia</z:e> (p &lt; 0.05), abnormality at the upper limit of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> (p &lt; 0.05), and advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal insufficiency</z:hpo> (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Life expectancy in patients that undergo successful AAA repair is lower than in the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> is often unrelated to AAA or the repair procedure, the incidence of morbidity due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> is higher than in a control population matched for age and sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that better management of concurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007222" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="CVD">cardiovascular disease</z:e> during the perioperative period and long-term follow-up holds the key to improving life expectancy in patients undergoing AAA repair </plain></SENT>
