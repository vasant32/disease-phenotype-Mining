<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To determine the accuracy of transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasound for evaluation of collateral supply through the circle of Willis in patients with internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The evaluation of the collateral pathways through the circle of Willis with TCD ultrasound and with cerebral angiography was compared in 40 patients (30 men, 10 women; mean age, 55 +/- 9 years) in a total of 44 ICA occlusions of which 43 had a suitable ipsilateral temporal bone window for TCD examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: By TCD, a patent anterior communicating artery is indicated by a reversal blood flow in the A1-segment of the anterior cerebral artery or by a prompt fall of blood velocity in the middle cerebral artery after compression of the nonoccluded contralateral carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 42 of 43 instances of ICA occlusion, TCD and angiography agreed in the evaluation of a present or absent anterior communicating artery collateral supply </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>TCD's sensitivity was 95%, its specificity 100% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A collateral supply through the basilar artery was assumed with TCD when there was: (a) a basilar artery blood velocity of more than 70 cm/s; (b) a marked increase of basilar artery blood velocity after compression of the nonoccluded carotid artery; (c) an evident side-to-side asymmetry of the blood velocity of the posterior cerebral arteries with high blood velocity ipsilateral to the ICA occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For evaluating the collateralization via the basilar artery, TCD and angiography agreed in 37 of 40 ICA occlusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>TCD's sensitivity was 87%, its specificity 95% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: TCD is a reliable tool for the evaluation of the collateral supply in patients with ICA occlusions </plain></SENT>
