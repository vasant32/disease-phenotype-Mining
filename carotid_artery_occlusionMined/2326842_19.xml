<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In view of these findings, we determined whether <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28757">fructose</z:chebi>-1,6-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="18361">diphosphate</z:chebi> protects the brain during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-<z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We subjected 16 rabbits to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo>, hypoxemia, and bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five minutes after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of isoelectric electroencephalograms, seven randomly selected rabbits received 10% <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28757">fructose</z:chebi>-1,6-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="18361">diphosphate</z:chebi> (350 mg/kg bolus followed by 10 mg/kg/min infusion for 90 minutes) and the remaining nine rabbits (controls) received an equal volume of 1.5% <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi> (3.5 ml/kg bolus followed by 0.1 ml/kg/min infusion for 90 minutes) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treated rabbits recovered electrical activity more rapidly than the controls (p less than 0.005), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> seven treated rabbits survived </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only two controls (22%) survived (p less than 0.001), and they were severely disabled </plain></SENT>
