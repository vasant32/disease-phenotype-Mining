<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether inhibition of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> p53 association using pifithrin-μ (PFT-μ) represents a potential novel neuroprotective strategy to combat perinatal hypoxic-ischemic (HI) brain damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seven-day-old rats were subjected to unilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> followed by intraperitoneal treatment with PFT-μ, an inhibitor of p53 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> association or PFT-α an inhibitor of p53 transcriptional activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cerebral damage, sensorimotor and cognitive function, apoptotic pathways (cytosolic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi>, Smac/DIABLO, active caspase 3), and <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> (<z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation and PARP-1 cleavage) were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: PFT-μ treatment completely prevented the HI-induced increase in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> p53 association at 3 hours and reduced neuronal damage at 48 hours post-HI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PFT-μ had long-term (6-10 weeks post-HI) beneficial effects as sensorimotor and cognitive outcome improved and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size was reduced by ~79% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neuroprotection by PFT-μ treatment was associated with strong inhibition of apoptotic pathways and reduced <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Unexpectedly, PFT-μ also inhibited HI-induced upregulation of p53 target genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the neuroprotective effect of inhibiting only p53 transcriptional activity by PFT-α was significantly smaller and did not involve reduced <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: We are the first to show that prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> p53 association by PFT-μ strongly improves functional outcome and decreases lesion size after neonatal HI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>PFT-μ not only inhibits <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> release of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi>, but also inhibits <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We propose that as a consequence nuclear accumulation of p53 and transcription of proapoptotic target genes are prevented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, targeting p53 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> association by PFT-μ may develop into a novel and powerful neuroprotective strategy </plain></SENT>
