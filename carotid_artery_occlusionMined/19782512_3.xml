<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To evaluate early and late results of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in female patients in a large single center experience </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Over a 12-year period ending in December 2007, 4009 consecutive primary and secondary CEAs in 3324 patients were performed at our institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were prospectively enrolled in a dedicated database containing pre-, intra-, and postoperative parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were female in 1200 cases (1020 patients; Group 1) and male in the remaining 2809 (2304 patients, Group 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Early results in terms of intraoperative neurological events and 30-day <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rates were analyzed and compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Follow-up results were analyzed with Kaplan Meier curves and compared with log-rank test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients of Group 1 were more likely to have <z:mp ids='MP_0001548'>hyperlipemia</z:mp>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>; patients of Group 2 were more likely to be smokers and to have concomitant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> (CAD) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>peripheral arterial disease</z:hpo> (PAD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in terms of clinical status or degree of stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients of Group 2 had a significantly higher percentage of contralateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> than patients in Group 1 (6.9% and 3.9%, respectively; P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thirty-day <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rates were similar in the two groups (1.2% for both groups) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Univariate analysis demonstrated the presence of CAD, PAD, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, and contralateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> to significantly affect 30-day <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate in female patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At multivariate analysis, only <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> (odds ratio [OR] 3.6, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.1-0.9; P = .05) and contralateral occlusion (OR 7.4, 95% CI 0.03-0.6; P = .006) were independently associated with an increased perioperative risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Median duration of follow-up was 27 months (range, 1-144 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There were no overall differences between the two groups in terms of survival, freedom from ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, freedom from any neurological symptom, and incidence of severe (&gt;70%) restenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In contrast to male patients, univariate and multivariate analysis demonstrated that female patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> or contralateral occlusion had an increased risk of developing ipsilateral neurological events during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Female sex per se does not represent an adjunctive risk factor during CEA, with early and long term results comparable to those obtained in male patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>However, in our study we found subgroups of female patients at higher surgical risk, requiring careful intra- and postoperative management </plain></SENT>
