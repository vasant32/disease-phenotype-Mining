<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms underlying this selective vulnerability to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> are only beginning to be elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied the effect of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> on alpha 1-adrenergic receptor binding by measuring [3H]<z:chebi fb="1" ids="8364">prazosin</z:chebi> binding in gerbil forebrain membranes after 10 min of bilateral carotid occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Binding was reduced from 62 +/- 3 to 33 +/- 4 fmol/mg protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Binding in the same membranes to beta 2-adrenergic receptors were also decreased, but not to the extent of that to alpha 1-adrenergic receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Binding to muscarinic cholinergic [( 3H]quinuclydil benzilate) and beta 1-adrenergic receptors were only slightly depressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, the protein content was significantly increased in the membrane fraction studied from ischemic forebrain (68 +/- 4 mg/g wet weight) compared with sham operated controls (57 +/- 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The dramatic decrease in alpha 1-adrenergic receptor binding during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> is consistent with receptor binding studies of membranes pretreated with phospholipase A2 in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is not clear what effect this change in alpha 1-adrenergic receptor binding has on subsequent selective neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The recent demonstration that <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamines</z:chebi> and locus ceruleus neurons influence the loss of CA1 neurons in the hippocampus suggests that it may play an important modulatory role </plain></SENT>
