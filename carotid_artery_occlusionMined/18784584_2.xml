<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The clinical and experimental management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> has not reached the therapeutic success seen in other medical conditions associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this work, we investigated the effect of a small molecule selectin inhibitor TBC-1269, in animals subjected to global <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> (GCI) and controlled hemorrhagic shock (CHS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-eight male Sprague-Dawley rats weighting between 275 g and 300 g were subjected to a model of GCI and CHS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three groups of animals were included in this study (n = 16 per group): sham/saline (group 1); GCI/CHS/Saline (group 2); GCI/CHS/TBC-1269 (group 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Experimental design consisted of bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> for 20 minutes, and the development of CHS until a mean arterial pressure of 50 mm Hg was reached </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 20 minutes, clamps were released, and resuscitation was achieved with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> saline, and the end point was to attain a mean arterial pressure of 80 mm Hg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treatment at the beginning of resuscitation included either <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> saline (groups 1 and 2) or TBC-1269 (25 mg/kg, group 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The following indices were evaluated: brain tissue myeloperoxidase, average numbers of ischemic neurons, and 7-day survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Brain myeloperoxidase was decreased in animals treated with TBC-1269, although this difference was not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Treated animals demonstrated a significant smaller amount of ischemic neurons than the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Survival was also improved from 40% in controls to 80% with TBC-1269 treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This difference was statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The use of a small molecule selectin inhibitor, TBC-1269, had a protective effect in this model of GCI and CHS, as evidenced by decreased numbers of ischemic neurons and improved survival rates </plain></SENT>
