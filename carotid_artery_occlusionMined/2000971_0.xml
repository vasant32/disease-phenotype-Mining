<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We measured microvascular venular pressure and diameter relations in 135 vessels during both control and baroreflexive conditions (bilateral carotid occlusion) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Microvascular pressure was measured using a servo-null pressure system, and diameters were obtained from a video-monitoring system with a total magnification of X1,000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>First-, second-, and fourth-order microvenules were studied in rat small intestinal muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The vessels showed an average diameter decrease of 11-12% and an increased stiffness or pressure-diameter slope of 31-53% during bilateral occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also tested whether the observed constriction during bilateral occlusion was caused by an increase in the sympathetic nerve activity to the venules and/or increased hormonal release via the baroreflex system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We studied an additional 22 microvenules before and after denervation of the preparation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Denervation eliminated any significant change in diameter or stiffness during bilateral occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Based on our data, we conclude that the changes in the venular properties observed during bilateral occlusion are due to the increased sympathetic nerve activity resulting from decreased carotid sinus pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Intestinal venules can actively constrict to change vascular capacitance during bilateral carotid occlusion </plain></SENT>
