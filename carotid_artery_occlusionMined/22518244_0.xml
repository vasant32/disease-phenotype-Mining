<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> angioplasty and stenting is a feasible option with little known about the long term outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Limiting factor for this approach is hyperperfusion syndrome or hemorrhagic infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Spontaneous early or late recanalization for extracranial vessel is in the range of 5% -30%, with no well defined clinical outcome data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We describe a case of spontaneous common carotid recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: An 88 year old man presented with right sided <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp>, global <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> and visual field loss and was discovered to have common carotid occlusion at its origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Within 12 hours of symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> patient improved neurologically to his baseline exam and repeat imaging demonstrated spontaneous recanalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This was followed symptomatic occlusion of left middle cerebral artery The patient was treated with multimodality approach resulting in complete revascularization of the middle cerebral artery and angioplasty and stent placement of the internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patient had a good neurological outcome at 3 months followup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The present case report demonstrates the risk of spontaneous recanalization acutely in patients presenting with common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and associated risk of embolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In such a patient, concomitant treatment for intracranial occlusion and extracranial high grade stenosis may be performed safely after 30 hours from the initial symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
