<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To test the pathophysiological relevance of this response, the influence of GM-CSF on brain energy state was investigated in a model of hemodynamic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sprague-Dawley rats were submitted to three-vessel (bilateral vertebral and unilateral common carotid artery) occlusion (3-VO) to induce unilaterally accentuated brain hypoperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One week later, hemodynamic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was induced by additional lowering of arterial blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Experiments were terminated by in situ freezing of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>ATP was measured in cryostat sections by using a bioluminescence method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The use of 3-VO, in combination with 15 min of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> of 50, 40, or 30 mmHg, did not produce disturbances of energy metabolism, however, focal areas of ATP <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> were unilaterally detected after 3-VO, in combination with 15 min of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> of 20 mmHg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treating such animals with GM-CSF (40 microg.kg(-1).d(-1)) during the 1-week interval between 3-VO and induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> significantly reduced the hemispheric volume of energy <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> from 48.8 +/- 44.2% (untreated group, n = 10) to 15.8 +/- 17.4% (treated group, n = 8, P = 0.033) </plain></SENT>
