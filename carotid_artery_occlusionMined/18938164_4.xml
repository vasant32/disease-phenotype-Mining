<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>When histologically evaluated at 7 and 28 days after the forebrain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (DAI) by staining with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52815">cresyl violet</z:chebi> and Fluoro-Jade, the hippocampal CA1 region was most prominently damaged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At 7 DAI, treatment with cilostazol (60 mg/kg/day, orally) significantly reduced the neuronal damage in the CA1 region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The number of surviving neurons, visualized by NeuN immunostaining, in the CA1 region significantly increased at 7 and 28 DAI in the cilostazol-treated groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To elucidate whether cilostazol enhances hippocampal neurogenesis after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, we planned a co-labeling study using 5-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="22927,47265">bromo</z:chebi>-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU), NeuN (a marker for mature neurons) and doublecortin (DCX) (a marker for immature migratory neuroblasts) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Double immunofluorescence staining at 7 DAI showed that cilostazol significantly increased the immunoreactivities of both DCX and phosphorylated cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) in the dentate gyrus that was co-expressed with BrdU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that cilostazol has dual beneficial effects preserving the CA1 hippocampal region and promoting the generation of immature migratory neuroblasts in the dentate gyrus by upregulation of CREB phosphorylation after transient forebrain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
