<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy from January 1996 to March 1997 at the John Radcliffe Hospital completed the United Kingdom Short Form 36 (SF-36) Health Survey Questionnaire before undergoing the procedure and again at 3 months afterward </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Scores were compared with population <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 50 patients with symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery disease</z:e>, there was significant improvement in the SF-36 overall "change in health" score after the procedure compared with beforehand (61.0 +/- 3.7 vs 44.5 +/- 3.4, P =.003, Wilcoxon signed rank test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were, however, no statistically significant differences in the group's mean SF-36 subscores after operation compared with before the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The physical subscores were below age-adjusted healthy population means but similar to those for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0008715" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">chronically ill</z:e> patients (physical function subscore P =.015 vs <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, P =.89 vs ill; role limitation-physical subscore P =.007 vs <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, P =.89 vs ill) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with postoperative complications did not have an improved change in health score (-12.5 vs 22.0, P =.03, Mann-Whitney U test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no effect on change in health score because of other risk factors or in patients with contralateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> or a history of preoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery disease</z:e> undergoing an uncomplicated carotid endarterectomy perceive improved quality of life and overall health </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There is no perception of worsened pain, energy, or physical or mental function after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results confirm that patients believe that performance of carotid endarterectomy improves their overall health, supporting the surgical approach to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
