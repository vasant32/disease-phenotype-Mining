<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 30 CEA indwelling shunt was necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among 30 patients with shunt 19 (63%) had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> before surgery, then 9 (30%) had contralateral internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among entire group of 238 patients with CEA 56 (23.5%) had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> before surgery and 27 (11.4%) contralateral internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In our opinion the strongest factor influencing neurological deficiency after clamping trial, is a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> before surgery and in a less degree contralateral internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean time of the neurological deficit during clamping trial was 27 seconds and varied from 5 to 100 sec. and never appeared after 2 minutes of mentioned trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For that reason we consider 2 minutes clamping trial as sufficient for detection of neurological deficit during CEA under local anaesthesia </plain></SENT>
