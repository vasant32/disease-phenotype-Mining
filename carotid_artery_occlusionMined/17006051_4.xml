<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Using monochromatic synchrotron radiation, we performed microangiography in C57BL/6J mice and investigated their vasculature after unilateral and bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Bilateral occlusion of the carotid artery was made by a ligation of the left common carotid artery followed by a ligation of the right internal carotid artery (ICA) two days later (n=12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Five days after the second surgery, angiography was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Unilateral occlusion was made by clipping the right ICA and then angiography was performed immediately (n=5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The control mice did not undergo any occlusion (n=5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We removed the brain of the bilateral occlusion mice after angiography and examined the infarction area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cerebral microvessels in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals were clearly visualized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the control mice, the posterior communicating artery (Pcom) was not visualized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the unilateral occlusion mice, the anastomosis of the pterygopalatine artery (PPA) and the external carotid artery (ECA) were recognized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The PPA is thus considered to play a role in the collateral vessel between the ICA and the ECA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The Pcom was not visualized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the bilateral occlusion mice, the Pcom was observed either unilaterally (n=5) or bilaterally (n=5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The Pcom supplied blood flow to the anterior circulation from the vertebrobasilar arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The bilateral occlusion mice that had at least one visualized Pcom did not have any infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>We could successfully visualize the cerebral vasculature of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mice and carotid artery occluded mice in an in vivo study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Microangiography can demonstrate the development of vasculature and the blood flow dynamics in mice </plain></SENT>
