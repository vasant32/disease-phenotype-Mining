<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CASE OUTLINE: A 56-year-old male was admitted to the Cardiovascular Institute "Dedinje" due to a clinically asymptomatic restenosis of the operated left internal carotid artery (ICA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Angiography and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) in previous hospitalization had revealed occluded right ICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, routine duplex ultrasonography revealed a high-grade restenosis (85%) of the left ICA and subocclusion of the right ICA by an ulcerated plaque (confirmed on repeated MRA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Selective arteriography examination could misrepresent the degree of stenosis especially in patents with the ICA that seems to be occluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MRA is considered the method of choice for identifying pseudo-occlusions of ICA </plain></SENT>
