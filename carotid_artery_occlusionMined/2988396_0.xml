<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The internal carotid artery can either be occluded radiologically by balloon catheter and then embolized if the artery is surrounded by a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>, or controlled surgically if the artery is in contact with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> only and provides only a small proportion of its vascular supply </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Whenever internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> is envisaged a clamping test by balloon under local anaesthesia is carried out initially </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The vertebral artery pedicles are interrupted during surgical approach to the artery above the atlas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The value of a 2 or even 3 stage operation for excision of very large <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> with posterior fossa extension is discussed </plain></SENT>
