<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although striatal neurons and white matter are recognized to be vulnerable to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, their injury after tGCI in mice has not been elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to evaluate injuries to striatal neurons and white matter after tGCI in C57BL/6 mice, and to develop a reproducible tGCI model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Male C57BL/6 mice were subjected to tGCI by bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (BCCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mice whose cortical cerebral blood flow after BCCAO decreased to less than 13% of the pre-ischemic value were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Histological analysis showed that at 3 days after 22 min of BCCAO, striatal neurons were injured more consistently than those in other brain regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Quantitative analysis of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> release into the cytosol and DNA fragmentation in the striatum showed consistent injury to the striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis revealed that DARPP-32-positive medium spiny neurons, the majority of striatal neurons, were the most vulnerable among the striatal neuronal subpopulations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The striatum (especially medium spiny neurons) was susceptible to <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> after tGCI, which is probably one of the mechanisms of vulnerability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>SMI-32 immunostaining showed that white matter in the striatum was also consistently injured 3 days after 22 min of BCCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We thus suggest that this is a tGCI model using C57BL/6 mice that consistently produces neuronal and white matter injury in the striatum by a simple technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This model can be highly applicable for elucidating molecular mechanisms in the brain after global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
