<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The effects of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46631">clonidine</z:chebi>, a central alpha 2 agonist, on changes in blood pressure caused by muscle afferent nerve (ergoreceptor) activation and baroreceptor manipulation were studied in cats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Prolonged isometric contractions (ergoreceptor activation) of the gastrocnemius and plantaris muscles <z:mp ids='MP_0004875'>increased mean arterial pressure</z:mp> by 53 mmHg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This pressor response was not altered by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7459">naloxone</z:chebi> (0.5 mumol.litre-1) but was eliminated by <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46631">clonidine</z:chebi> (0.5-2.0 micrograms) when injected into the cerebral aqueduct </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Brief occlusion of the carotid artery (15-30 s) caused mean arterial pressure to increase by 32-42 mmHg at rest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neither <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7459">naloxone</z:chebi> nor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="46631">clonidine</z:chebi> altered the magnitude of the reflex pressor response to carotid occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similar increases in pressure were measured when occlusion was applied during fatiguing isometric contractions; thus baroreceptor induced increases in pressure were superimposed on the ergoreceptor induced blood pressure changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="7459">Naloxone</z:chebi> did not affect the changes in pressure caused by either reflex response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="4" ids="46631">Clonidine</z:chebi> continued to eliminate the pressor response to muscular contraction but did not affect the pressure increase when the carotid occlusion was applied during contractions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Electrical stimulation of the carotid sinus nerve caused blood pressure to decrease by 36 mmHg during rest and by 41 mmHg during fatiguing isometric contractions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="4" ids="46631">Clonidine</z:chebi> did not alter the depressor response to carotid sinus nerve stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data may indicate that separate pathways centrally mediate the changes in blood pressure caused by ergoreceptor and baroreceptor afferent activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The integration of the ergoreceptor pathway may involve a catecholaminergic-opioidergic system but the present results do not suggest a similar interaction for the baroreceptor integration </plain></SENT>
