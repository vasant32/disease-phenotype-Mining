<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent investigations indicated that acidic preconditioning (APC) protects against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced cardiomyocytes injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, it is not clear whether APC can protect against <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To address this issue, C57BL/6 mice were exposed 3 times at 10-min intervals to a normoxic atmosphere containing 20% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16526">CO(2)</z:chebi> for 5 min before being further subjected to bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>APC reversed the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced brain injury as revealed by improved performance in passive avoidance experiments and decreased neuron loss in the hippocampal CA1 region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Consistently, both APC-treated brain slices and primary cultured neurons were more resistant to oxygen-<z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-deprivation (OGD)-induced injury, in a pH- and time-dependent manner, as revealed by reversed cell/tissue viability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, the APC treatment prevented OGD-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> transmembrane potential loss and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, which was inhibited by the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> permeability transport pore opener atractyloside </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these findings indicated that APC protects against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced neuronal injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The beneficial effects may be attributed, at least in part, to decreased mitochondria-dependent neuronal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
