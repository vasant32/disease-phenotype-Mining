<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The safety and efficacy of selective intraarterial administration of urokinase in five male patients, (age range 30 to 65 years, mean 41.2 years), with occlusive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> involving the carotid territory and a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cranial computed tomography scan was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The time elapsed before treatment ranged from one to 10 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Digital subtraction angiography disclosed distal internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in one patient and occlusion of the middle cerebral artery or its branches in the others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The urokinase dose ranged from 120,000 to 500,000 units </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In two patients who received thrombolytic treatment within three hours of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms, there was a 100% recanalisation associated with excellent neurological recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the remaining three patients, recanalisation rate varied from 0 to 50% with partial recovery in two and no recovery in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>None had a haemorrhagic transformation of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although no firm conclusions can be drawn because of the small number of patients studied, selective intraarterial urokinase therapy appears to be safe and useful in patients with carotid territory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> if undertaken early </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only through a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial, enough number of patients can be recruited to verify these observations </plain></SENT>
