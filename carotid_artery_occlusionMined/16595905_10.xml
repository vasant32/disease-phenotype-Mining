<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined the role of MAPK pathways and the effect of treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31530">edaravone</z:chebi> in the brain after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-reperfusion (I/R) injury in a bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (BCAO) model with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> for 85 min followed by reperfusion for 45 min in aged rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Western immunoblotting, immunostaining, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), spectrophotometry, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase nick end labeling (TUNEL) and triphenyl tetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC) staining were performed to evaluate various proteins in the homogenate, c-Jun <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29318,29339">NH2</z:chebi>-terminal kinase (JNK) in the tissue sections, protein <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23019">carbonyl</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> peroxidase (GSHPx), <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results showed that I/R injury resulted in a reduction of GSHPx, but protein <z:chebi fb="1" ids="23019">carbonyl</z:chebi> content and inducible nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase were increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The activation of JNK and its downstream molecule c-Jun was significantly increased after injury, whereas the activities of p38 MAPK and extracellular-regulated kinase 1/2 were slightly but not significantly increased </plain></SENT>
