<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The reasons are not just the high incidence and relatively high prevalence of letal outcomes in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> faze of the desease, but also high level of disfunctionality caused by this disease in numerous patients who survived cerebrovascular insult and haemorraghe The <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, course and outcome of cerebrovascular diseases depends among other things on the possibility o f colateral brain circulation establishment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Willis ring onthe base of the brain is the most important anastomosis between circulation in both carotid arteries and basilar artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>First precondition for Willis ring t o function as valvular mechanisam is its intact configuration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>But, it is found in almost half of th e subjectsincluded in the study that certain anatomical abnormalities in the Willis ring structure exist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Presence of these abnormalities favors <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular diseases</z:e> since they unables colateral circulation establishment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Studies till now have shown that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> components of Willis ring do not contribute equally in colateral function among obstructive diseases </plain></SENT>
