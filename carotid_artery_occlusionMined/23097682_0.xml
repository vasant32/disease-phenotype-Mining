<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated that α-BC and microtubule-associated protein-2 (MAP-2), a neuron-specific cytoskeleton protein, were coexpressed in neurons of Gerbil cortex, while in subcortex Gerbil brains, we found that several MAP-2-negative glia cells also express α-BC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When subjected to 10-minute bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (BCAO), an increment was observed in α-BC-positive cells after 6-hour reperfusion and peaked at around 7 days after </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the same circumstances, the number and the staining concentration of MAP-2 positive neurons significantly decreased immediately after 6-hour reperfusion, followed by a slow recovery, which is consistent with the increase of α-BC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results suggested that α-BC plays an important role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e>, providing the early protection of neurons by giving intracellular supports through the maintenance of cytoskeleton and extracellular supports through the protection of glia cells </plain></SENT>
