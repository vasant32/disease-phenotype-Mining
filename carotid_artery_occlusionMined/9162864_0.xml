<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Vasomotor reactivity (VMR) was tested by combined examination of TCD and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi>-133 cerebral blood flow (CBF) before and after intravenous administration of 1 g <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At follow-up CBF was measured using single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computerised tomography (SPECT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In two patients mean velocities in the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) were within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range at repetitive examinations with good VMR ranging 30-111%, whereas CBF was reduced in <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territories ranging 29-36 ml 100 g(-1) min(-1), but increasing 44-69% after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi>, indicating good VMR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These 2 cases had anterograde flow in the ophthalmic artery and siphon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The third patient had very low <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> mean velocities of 21-27 cm sec(-1), increasing 26-33% after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This patient had retrograde flow in the ophthalmic artery and siphon connected with bilateral prolonged episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100576'>amaurosis fugax</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three patients the posterior cerebral arteries were major supplying collaterals having high mean velocities of about 100 cm sec(-1) and high velocities in the basilar arteries of 85 cm sec(-1) as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During follow up no patient had a new <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> experienced orthostatic dizziness and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
