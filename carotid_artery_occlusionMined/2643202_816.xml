<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In preliminary studies, 60 rats were anesthetized with ketamine and different combinations of vessels were occluded; blood pressure and arterial blood gases were monitored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neurologic deficit, mortality rate, gross pathology, and in some instances, electroencephalogram and histochemical staining results were evaluated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> surviving rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The principal procedure consisted of introducing a 4-0 nylon intraluminal suture into the cervical internal carotid artery (ICA) and advancing it intracranially to block blood flow into the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>; collateral blood flow was reduced by interrupting <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> branches of the external carotid artery (ECA) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> extracranial branches of the ICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In some groups of rats, bilateral vertebral or contralateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was also performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>India ink perfusion studies in 20 rats documented blockage of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> blood flow in 14 rats subjected to permanent occlusion and the restoration of blood flow to the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory in six rats after withdrawal of the suture from the ICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The best method of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion was then selected for further confirmatory studies, including histologic examination, in five additional groups of rats anesthetized with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Seven of eight rats that underwent permanent occlusion of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> had resolving moderately severe neurologic deficits (Grade 2 of 4) and unilateral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> averaging 37.6 +/- 5.5% of the coronal sectional area at 72 hours after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of occlusion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
