<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Animal studies have suggested that the reduction in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk observed with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15346">coenzyme A</z:chebi> (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statins</z:chebi>) therapy is owing to an increase in basal cerebral blood flow (CBF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the study was to determine if <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> therapy was associated with increased CBF in humans with cerebrovascular atherosclerotic disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Quantitative measurements of CBF were obtained on study entry in 97 patients with carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> enrolled in a prospective study of cerebral hemodynamics and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study represents a post hoc analysis of CBF measurements based on whether patients were receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> therapy at the time of CBF measurement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Global and regional CBF (including hemispheric, basal ganglia, and arterial borderzones), and baseline clinical, epidemiologic, and laboratory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk factors were compared between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nineteen of the 97 patients were on a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> agent on study entry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> group was younger, had significantly lower <z:chebi fb="15" ids="39026">LDL</z:chebi> levels and included more women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">Statin</z:chebi> therapy was not associated with higher baseline values of CBF in global or regional analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean middle cerebral artery territory CBF (+/-s.d.) ipsilateral to the occluded carotid artery was 37.6+/-12.7 mL/100 g min for the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> group (n=19) compared with 38.6+/-12.7 mL/100 g min for the nonstatin group (n=78) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Contralateral values were 42.9+/-13.5 and 44.2+/-13.3 mL/100 g min for the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> and nonstatin groups, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk reduction observed with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35664">statin</z:chebi> therapy in humans likely involves mechanisms other than an increased basal CBF </plain></SENT>
