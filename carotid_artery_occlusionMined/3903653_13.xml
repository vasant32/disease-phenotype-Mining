<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>R.A.P. was reduced in steps and maintained constant for 5 min using an inflatable renal artery cuff and a pressure control system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The stimulus-response curve obtained during control conditions (C) or during common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (C.C.O.) could be approximated by two linear sections: a rather flat section or plateau-level of P.R.A.-difference at <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> blood pressure or above, and a very steep section between a distinct threshold pressure and 65-70 mm Hg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>While the parameters of the curves varied from dog to dog, the curves kept their unique shape in the individual dog for at least 1 week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>C.C.O. had no effect on the plateau-level of the P.R.A.-difference (C:0.98 +/- 0.14, C.C.O:0.99 +/- 0.14 ng AI  </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Renal blood flow, which was measured simultaneously in three of the dogs, showed good autoregulation down to 70 mm Hg under resting conditions and was not affected by C.C.O. except for a 30% reduction of renal blood flow at the lowest pressure step (70 mm Hg).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
