<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effect of neonatal hypoxic-ischemic insults on brain fatty acid composition is not completely understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate alterations in brain fatty acid composition during development and in response to hypoxic-ischemic insults in neonatal rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Methods: Postnatal day 7 pups were randomly assigned to two experimental groups: a control group or a hypoxic-ischemic group in which <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was produced by left common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and exposure to 8% oxygen for 1.5 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Various brain fatty acids were measured on postnatal days 8, 10 and 14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results: On postnatal day 14, the ratio of DHA to total fatty acids increased in the control group, but not in the hypoxic-ischemic group (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We observed no significant differences in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi> content in the brain between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: These results suggest that hypoxic-ischemic insults interfere with accumulation of brain DHA in developing rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DHA supplementation may be beneficial for treating neonatal hypoxic-ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
