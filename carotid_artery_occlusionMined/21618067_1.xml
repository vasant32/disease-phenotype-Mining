<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Volatile <z:chebi fb="37" ids="38867">anesthetics</z:chebi> reduce postischemic neurohistopathological injury and improve neurological outcome in various animal models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> concentrations above 1 minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) have been associated with reduced neuronal survival and impaired functional outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate if 1.8 MAC <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9130">sevoflurane</z:chebi> alters postischemic neuronal survival and neurologic outcome compared with 0.45 MAC <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9130">sevoflurane</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this study, 20 fasted male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to treatment groups with 1 or 4 vol.% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9130">sevoflurane</z:chebi> end-tidal concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>Cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was induced by bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> (BCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cognitive outcome was assessed after 7 days using the object recognition test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Animals were then re-anesthetized and brains were removed for neurohistopathological analysis of the hippocampus (CA1) and cortex using <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi>-eosin staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Physiologic parameters were not different between both the treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The number of viable neurons (median [Q1, Q3]) in the CA1 region on postischemic day 7 was increased after high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9130">sevoflurane</z:chebi> compared with low-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9130">sevoflurane</z:chebi> (1645 [453, 1825] vs. 3222 [2920, 3993] neurons/ROI, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Results of the object recognition test were not different between both the treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Postischemic neuronal survival was increased with 1.8 MAC compared with 0.45 MAC <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9130">sevoflurane</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Therefore, experimental models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> should account for neuroprotective effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9130">sevoflurane</z:chebi> with increasing concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>To ensure minimal interference of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9130">sevoflurane</z:chebi> on neuronal survival, a low inspired concentration should be used and fluctuations in the depth of anesthesia should be limited </plain></SENT>
