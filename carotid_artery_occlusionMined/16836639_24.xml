<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Brain injury and myelination were examined on postnatal day 21 (P21) and tests for neurobehavioral toxicity were performed from P3 to P21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hypoxic-ischemic insults resulted in severe white matter injury, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002119'>enlarged ventricles</z:hpo>, deficits in the hippocampus, reduction in numbers of mature oligodendrocytes and tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neurons, damage to axons and dendrites, and impaired myelination, as indicated by the decrease in myelin basic protein immunostaining in the P21 rat brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hypoxic-ischemic insult also significantly affected physical development (body <z:mp ids='MP_0005456'>weight gain</z:mp> and eye opening) and neurobehavioral performance, including sensorimotor and locomotor function, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000739'>anxiety</z:hpo> and cognitive ability in the P21 rat </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The protection of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50694">minocycline</z:chebi> was associated with its ability to reduce microglial activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The present results show that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50694">minocycline</z:chebi> has long-lasting protective effects in the neonatal rat brain in terms of both <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced brain injury and the associated neurological dysfunction </plain></SENT>
