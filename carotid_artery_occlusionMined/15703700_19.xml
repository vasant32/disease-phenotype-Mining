<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rats with CBH underwent bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (2-vessel occlusion (2-VO)) for either 26 or 8 weeks and were compared with nonoccluded sham controls (S-VO) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Electron microscopic immunocytochemical examination using an antibody against eNOS showed 2-VO rats had significant loss or absence of eNOS-containing positive gold particles in hippocampal endothelium and these changes were associated with endothelial cell compression, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> damage and heavy <z:mpath ids='MPATH_34'>amyloid deposition</z:mpath> in hippocampal capillaries and perivascular region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the 8-week study, three groups of 2-VO rats were administered an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> dose of 7-NI, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40618">aminoguanidine</z:chebi> or L-NIO, the relatively selective inhibitors of nNOS, inducible NOS and eNOS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only rats administered the eNOS inhibitor L-NIO worsened markedly their watermaze performance (P = 0.009) when compared with S-VO nonoccluded controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude from these findings that vascular nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> derived from eNOS may play a critical role in spatial memory function during CBH possibly by keeping cerebral perfusion optimal through its regulation of microvessel tone and cerebral blood flow and that disruption of this mechanism can result in spatial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
