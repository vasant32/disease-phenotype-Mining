<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>From the impedance spectra initially, and following internal and external carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, separate estimations of internal carotid, external carotid and external/internal collateral bed impedances were derived by the use of network theory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Studies were carried out on six dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The common carotid input resistance was 10.98 +/- 1.42 (S.E.M.) X 10(6) kN.m-5.s, while those for the internal, external and collateral beds were 48.80 +/- 7.12, 14.94 +/- 2.37 and 171.42 +/- 46.83 X 10(6) kN.m-5.s respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The impedance spectrum of the common carotid, external carotid and collateral beds were of a high impedance type with major reflexions, while that for the internal carotid bed was of low impedance type with much less reflexion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On standardization of impedance for tissue mass the resistance levels became 17.44 +/- 2.91 X 10(6) kN.m-5.s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>100 g-1 for internal and 85.41 +/- 4.75 X 10(6) kN.m-5.s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>100 g-1 for external carotid beds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, common carotid input impedance differences between dog and man are due to differences in relative mass of tissue perfused by internal and external carotid arteries, rather than to different peripheral-bed characteristics in the two species </plain></SENT>
