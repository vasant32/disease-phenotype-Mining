<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The correlation between the echogenicity of the occlusion (anechogenic, hypoechogenic or hyperechogenic) and the time interval between the ischaemic symptoms and the ultrasonic investigation showed that some occlusions are hypoanechogenic and others hyperechogenic, in spite of the time interval, and consequently the echogenicity of the occlusion cannot be correlated with the time of its formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Duplex scanning allows a correct diagnosis in almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> by comparison of the morphological and flowmetric data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 95% sensitivity in 20 cases was explored by digital angiography also </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It was concluded that angiography was usually unnecessary to confirm a carotid occlusion and its use could be limited to rare, doubtful, cases and to patients with contralateral stenosis i.e. candidates for surgery </plain></SENT>
