<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Ten patients with symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> were found to have totally occluded internal carotid arteries with significant external carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> or occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eight patients underwent external carotid endarterectomy, and two patients underwent saphenous vein bypass to the external carotid artery from the subclavian artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow was measured with 133Xe in six patients preoperatively and in five postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four of the six patients had diminished mean flow on the affected side, and three had diminished flow in the contralateral side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had abnormalities in regional cerebral blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Postoperatively, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients had significant improvement in mean blood flow on the side treated with operation (15% to 39%), and four had improvement of blood flow on the contralateral side (12% to 52%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> had improvement in regional cerebral blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nine of the 10 patients were relieved of their symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One patient, despite improvement in cerebral blood flow, continued to have diminished cerebral flow and symptoms postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Subsequent extracranial-intracranial bypass relieved his symptoms and his cerebral blood flow returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus external carotid artery revascularization is effective in increasing total and regional cerebral blood flow and in relieving symptoms of internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and external <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow measurement with 133Xe is useful in preoperative patient selection and objective assessment of operative results </plain></SENT>
