<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used simultaneous in vivo 2-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> imaging and electrophysiological recordings in adult mouse somatosensory cortex to examine spreading depolarization-induced astroglial structural changes concurrently with signs of neuronal injury in the early periods of focal and global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Astrocytes in the metabolically compromised ischemic penumbra-like area showed a long lasting swelling response to spontaneous spreading depolarizations despite rapid dendritic recovery in a photothrombotic occlusion model of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Astroglial swelling was often facilitated by recurrent depolarizations and the magnitude of swelling strongly correlated with the total duration of depolarization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, spreading depolarization-induced astroglial swelling was transient in normoxic healthy tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a model of transient global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, the occurrence of a single spreading depolarization elicited by a bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> coincided with astroglial swelling alongside dendritic beading </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With immediate reperfusion, dendritic beading subsides </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Astroglial swelling was either transient during short ischemic periods distinguished by a short-lasting spreading depolarization, or persistent during severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> characterized by a long-lasting depolarization with the ultraslow negative voltage component </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We propose that persistent astroglial swelling is initiated and exacerbated during spreading depolarization in brain tissue with moderate to severe energy deficits, disrupting astroglial maintenance of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> homeostatic function thus contributing to the negative outcome of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> as astrocytes fail to provide neuronal support </plain></SENT>
