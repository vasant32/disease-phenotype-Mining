<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CT was performed within 4 hr and angiography within 6 hr after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CT was used to assess the site and size of parenchymal brain damage and angiography was used to evaluate the cerebral circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A 3-month follow-up CT study was used to determine the site and size of final ischemic damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Angiography was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in six patients and showed complete occlusion in 30 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Angiographic findings in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> were classified as either internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> or middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusions were subdivided into occlusion before the origin of internal lenticulostriate arteries (type 1), occlusion beyond the origin of these branches (type 2), occlusion at the bifurcation of the main trunk (type 3), and occlusion of the peripheral branches (type 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Collateral blood supply was also studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Early CT findings were positive in 25 of 36 patients; the lentiform nucleus alone, the lentiform nucleus and the cortex, or only the cortex were involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with positive early CT findings, angiography showed an <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp>, often located in the main trunk of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Involvement of the lentiform nucleus on early CT was always seen in patients with internal carotid artery or type 1 MCA occlusion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
