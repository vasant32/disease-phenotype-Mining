<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Perfusion <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging and single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission CT (SPECT) are commonly used to evaluate hemodynamic status in patients with symptomatic occlusive cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These techniques rely on different underlying physiological mechanisms, and the data may not correspond </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied the relationship between hemodynamic parameters obtained with these two methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed perfusion <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging and SPECT in 10 patients with symptomatic unilateral internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) and uncorrected mean transit time (uMTT) were obtained with dynamic contrast-enhanced T2*-weighted <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Relative cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and vascular reserve capacity were measured with 99mTc-HMPAO SPECT; vascular reserve capacity was calculated by the difference in CBF before and after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> challenge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ratios of these hemodynamic parameters between the affected and contralateral vascular territories were calculated and compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath>-to-increased CBV, prolonged uMTT, decreased CBF, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-to-diminished vascular reserve capacity were observed in the affected vascular territories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Reduction of vascular reserve capacity corresponded well with uMTT but not with CBF and CBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CBF, CBV, and uMTT did not correspond to one another </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: uMTT is more sensitive than the other parameters in estimating vascular reserve capacity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The relationship between parameters obtained with perfusion <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging and SPECT should be considered in assessing the hemodynamic status of patients with symptomatic occlusive cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
