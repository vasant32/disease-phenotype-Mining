<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The rate of oxygen disappearance from the gerbil cerebral cortex was measured during bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> with an oxygen microelectrode at <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> tissue <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37370">PO2</z:chebi> and under hyperbaric oxygenation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The oxygen disappearance rate (ODR) was found to be heavily dependent on the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37370">PO2</z:chebi> at occlusion due to the desaturation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>-bound oxygen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When the tissue <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37370">PO2</z:chebi> was elevated to a level high enough to saturate <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>, the ODR reflected the oxygen consumption rate which was calculated to range from 1.6-7.4 cc O2/100 cc tissue-min. for ten <z:chebi fb="8" ids="29745">barbiturate</z:chebi>-anesthetized animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The fall in <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37370">PO2</z:chebi> was found not to be totally linear to zero in many cases, but instead consisted of a linear phase followed by a period of decreasing slope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We believe this phase of changing slope represents a diminishing oxygen consumption rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The exact nature of this decrease is not known but perhaps is an inhibitory response to the accumulation of metabolites as a result of the circulation arrest </plain></SENT>
