<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We examined the recovery of arterial pressure control after carotid sinus baroreceptor denervation in conscious dogs with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001678'>atrioventricular block</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Strength of control was assessed by measuring changes in peripheral resistance and atrial rate after step changes in cardiac output </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One day after carotid denervation, arterial pressure was significantly elevated (+13.7 mmHg), and the strength of control of peripheral resistance and atrial rate were significantly decreased to 46.1 and 36.6% of control, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Over 4-7 days, the strength of control of both peripheral resistance and atrial rate and the mean arterial pressure returned to the levels observed before denervation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After carotid denervation, the pressor response to bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was abolished, and thus the recovery of arterial pressure control was not caused by inadequate carotid denervation or regeneration of carotid baroreceptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The recovery of arterial pressure control after carotid denervation is probably caused by an increase in the reflex responses to pressure changes at the aortic baroreceptors and may reflect plasticity within the baroreflex pathway </plain></SENT>
