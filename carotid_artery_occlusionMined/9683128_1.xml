<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-seven patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy contralateral to an occluded internal carotid artery were each paired with two control group patients (n = 74) undergoing carotid endarterectomy contralateral to a patent internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients preferentially underwent electroencephalographic monitoring, selective shunting, and patch angioplasty for vessel closure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The perioperative rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was 5% (n = 2) in the occluded group and 3% (n = 2) in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ninety-two percent of the occluded group and 96% of the control patients were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-free over a mean follow-up of 23.8 and 27.2 months, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No statistical difference was noted between groups for perioperative rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (P = 0.60), mean <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-free rates (P = 0.37), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate by life-table analysis (P = 0.33), or survival by life-table analysis (P = 0.43) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients who have carotid endarterectomy performed contralateral to an occluded internal carotid artery showed no difference for perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, late <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, or survival </plain></SENT>
