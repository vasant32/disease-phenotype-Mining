<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 98 patients randomized to intravenous (IV) tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) or placebo 3 to 6 h after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, we examined increasing <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> DWI and PWI lesion volumes (Tmax-with 2-sec delay increments), and increasing PWI/DWI mismatch ratios, on the odds of both excellent (modified Rankin Scale (mRS): 0 to 1) and poor (mRS: 5 to 6) clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with very large PWI lesions (most had internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>) had increased odds ratio (OR) of poor outcome with IV-tPA (58% versus 25% placebo; OR=4.13, P=0.032 for Tmax +2-sec volume &gt;190 mL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Excellent outcome from tPA treatment was substantially increased in patients with DWI lesions &lt;18 mL (77% versus 18% placebo, OR=15.0, P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Benefit from tPA was also seen with DWI lesions up to 25 mL (69% versus 29% placebo, OR=5.5, P=0.03), but not for DWI lesions &gt;25 mL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, increasing mismatch ratios did not influence the odds of excellent outcome with tPA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical responsiveness to IV-tPA, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> outcome, depends more on baseline DWI and PWI lesion volumes than the extent of perfusion-diffusion mismatch </plain></SENT>
