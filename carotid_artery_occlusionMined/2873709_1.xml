<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The microsphere technique was used for blood flow determinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Animals subjected to haemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> and simultaneous carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (group BC) exhibited a stronger immediate vasoconstrictor response than animals subjected to haemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> only (group B) and more blood had to be withdrawn to achieve stable <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> at 50 mmHg (2.6 +/- 0.1 vs. 2.2 +/- 0.4 ml per 100 g body weight (body wt); P less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, group B showed the same decrease in cardiac output as group BC, but the blood flows of the kidneys, spleen, intestine, liver and skin were less deranged at the end of the hypotensive period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Groups B and BC exhibited similar intestinal ischaemic mucosal damage, measured as leakage of [125I]albumin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When induction of haemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> was combined with ganglionic blockade administration (Arfonad) and carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (group ABC), significantly less blood had to be withdrawn than in groups BC (1.6 +/- 0.2 vs. 2.6 +/- 0.1 ml per 100 g body wt; P less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The blood flows of the kidneys, small intestine, liver, spleen and skin were less compromised in group ABC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, group BC had more profound <z:hpo ids='HP_0001942'>metabolic acidosis</z:hpo> and were more haemoconcentrated than group ABC; moreover, group BC, tended to be hypoglycaemic and showed intestinal mucosal damage, whereas neither of these effects occurred in group ABC.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
