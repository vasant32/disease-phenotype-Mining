<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Extracranial-intracranial (ECIC) bypass grafts have been assessed postoperatively by various neuroradiologic techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate postoperative changes in ECIC bypass graft by using superficial temporal artery duplex ultrasonography (STDU) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, this study assessed the ability of STDU to predict cerebrovascular reserve capacity (CVR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-five consecutive patients who underwent ECIC bypass procedure for atherosclerotic internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> were enrolled in this prospective study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission CT and STDU preoperatively, 14 days after, 3 months after, 1 year after, and 2 years after ECIC bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The diameter and flow velocities of the ipsilateral superficial temporal artery (STA), and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) showed increase during the first 2 weeks and then remained stable, whereas CVR showed a constant improvement up to 2 years after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The STA diameter and mean STA flow velocity correlated significantly with CVR at 1 year after surgery (r2 = 0.1232 and r2 = 0.08716, respectively; P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A cutoff value of 1.8 mm STA diameter was determined as the most reliable value to predict CVR greater than 10% at 1 year after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The positive predictive value was calculated as 96.6%, the negative predictive value as 43.8%, the sensitivity as 75.7%, the specificity as 87.5%, and the likelihood ratio as 6.056 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: ECIC bypass grafts can be assessed postoperatively in a noninvasive fashion with STDU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This technique provides information regarding patency as well as quantitative assessment of bypass function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Moreover, STDU is useful to predict CVR improvement </plain></SENT>
