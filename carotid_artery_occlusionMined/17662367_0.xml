<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The management of the unruptured AcomA <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> associated with atherosclerotic occlusion of the unilateral internal carotid artery (ICA) raises several strategic dilemmas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two such patients with unruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> on the AcomA, which supply cross-flow toward the hemisphere with ICA occlusion, are presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both patients were treated with STA-M2 bypass followed by clipping of the unruptured AcomA <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> in 1 stage through the transsylvian route </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both patients were doing well without neurological deficit nor <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> at 1 year follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In the surgical treatment of unruptured AcomA <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> with atherosclerotic ICA occlusion, preceding bypass would be ideal in case of intraoperative rupture as well as to reduce perioperative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> if the bypass procedure itself could be performed with minimal risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Enough and atraumatic exposure of the sylvian fissure contributed to reduce brain retraction during the clipping of AcomA <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> and, in addition, to ease the STA-M2 bypass </plain></SENT>
