<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, many do remain free of associated events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To determine which are most dangerous, we compared risk factors and duplex scan results in two groups with asymptomatic high-grade internal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007282" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery stenoses</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Group A included 31 patients with 33 unoperated high-grade lesions that remained asymptomatic for at least 12 months (mean 30 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Group B included 25 patients with 26 initially asymptomatic lesions that subsequently were associated with a neurologic event (mean time to event 7.4 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The groups did not differ significantly in average age, sex, aspirin use, smoking, or prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp>, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With respect to the index high-grade lesion, there was no difference in the frequency of a greater than 50% contralateral internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> or greater than 50% ipsilateral external <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, on duplex scanning, high-grade stenoses with greater than 6.5 kHz end-diastolic frequencies were more frequently associated with an event than high-grade lesions with lower end-diastolic frequency (p = 0.0004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Similarly, seven of 23 lesions (30%) with end-diastolic frequency greater than 6.0 kHz were associated with subsequent internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> compared to only one of 29 (3.5%) with end-diastolic frequency less than or equal to 6.0 kHz (p = 0.025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Analysis of internal carotid artery end-diastolic frequency may help select a subgroup of patients with asymptomatic high-grade lesions who are at greatest risk for subsequent neurologic symptoms or ICA occlusion or both </plain></SENT>
