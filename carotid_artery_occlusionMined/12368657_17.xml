<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors tested the hypotheses that physiologically relevant levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16469">17beta-estradiol</z:chebi> are neuroprotective in global <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and that neuroprotection is mediated via apoE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the first study, subcutaneous implants of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16469">17beta-estradiol</z:chebi> were tested in female C57Bl/6J mice (ovariectomized and nonovariectomized) and plasma levels measured by radioimmunoassay to validate that physiologically relevant levels could be achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the second study, female C57Bl/6J and apoE-deficient mice were ovariectomized and implanted with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16469">17beta-estradiol</z:chebi> or placebo pellet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two weeks later, transient global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was induced by bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and the mice killed after 72 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ischemic and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> neurons were counted in the caudate nucleus and CA1 pyramidal cell layer and the percentage of neuronal damage was compared between the treated groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In C57Bl/6J mice, there was less neuronal damage in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16469">17beta-estradiol</z:chebi>-treated group compared with placebo group in the caudate nucleus (15 +/- 20% versus 39 +/- 27%, = 0.02) and in the CA1 pyramidal cell layer (1.8 +/- 2% versus 10 +/- 14%, = 0.08) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, neuronal damage was not significantly different between the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16469">17beta-estradiol</z:chebi> and placebo groups in apoE-deficient mice in the caudate nucleus (47 +/- 35% versus 53 +/- 29%, = 0.7) or in the CA1 pyramidal cell layer (24 +/- 19% versus 24 +/- 19%, = 1.0) </plain></SENT>
