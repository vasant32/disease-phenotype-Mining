<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report a case of NVG with ICA occlusion improved by intravitreal bevacizumab (<z:mp ids='MP_0010560'>IVB</z:mp>) injection and carotid artery stent replacement (CAS), even though we did not perform panretinal photocoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A 67-year-old male with NVG noted <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> in his left eye </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance angiography showed left ICA occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>He was diagnosed with NVG secondary to ICA occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The next day, we carried out <z:mp ids='MP_0010560'>IVB</z:mp> injection in his left eye, following which the iris and angle neovascularization regressed, and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0028841" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">intraocular pressure decreased</z:e> to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> within a day after the injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CAS was performed on his left ICA at a month post injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two months later, we reinjected bevacizumab in his left eye </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>His condition remained stable with no recurrence over two years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This case indicates that <z:mp ids='MP_0010560'>IVB</z:mp> injection and CAS are useful for early-stage NVG secondary to ICA occlusion </plain></SENT>
