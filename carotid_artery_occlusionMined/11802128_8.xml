<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Carotid angioplasty and stenting is under investigation in clinical trials as an alternative to endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some clinicians have hypothesized that stenting would be applicable for patients at high risk who need carotid revascularization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To further test this hypothesis, we stratified our carotid endarterectomy procedures according to current carotid stent protocols </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed our computerized registry and the clinical charts of patients who underwent carotid endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each procedure was categorized as high risk or low risk, according to the following six separate high-risk factors: 1, severe cardiac dysfunction; 2, the requirement for combined coronary and carotid vascularization; 3, severe pulmonary dysfunction; 4, contralateral internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>; 5, previous ipsilateral carotid endarterectomy; and 6, anatomically limited access for carotid endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> at 30 days, cardiac complications, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were tabulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Between January 1, 1998, and December 31, 2000, 415 carotid endarterectomies were performed on 389 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ninety-eight procedures (23.6%) were classified as high risk on the basis of the following factors: 1, severe cardiac dysfunction (n = 30); 2, requirement for combined coronary and carotid revascularization (n = 14); 3, severe pulmonary dysfunction (n = 8); 4, contralateral carotid occlusion (n = 31); 5, previous ipsilateral carotid endarterectomy (n = 25); and 6, anatomically limited access (n = 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Seven patients had ipsilateral postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> (1.7%), with two additional patients having contralateral hemispheric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One patient died from exacerbation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> 9 days after undergoing a second carotid endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The total <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate was 2.6% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Two of the 98 procedures in the high-risk group were complicated with ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (2.0%) as compared with six of the 317 low-risk procedures (1.9%; P = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Six procedures were complicated with cardiac dysfunction after surgery, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo>, or the new <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Three cardiac complications occurred in the low-risk group (1%), and three occurred in the high-risk group (3.1%; P =.15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This series shows that patients at high risk can undergo carotid endarterectomy with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rates equivalent to the rates of patients at low risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The cardiac morbidity rate may be increased in the high-risk group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Carotid stenting is unlikely to offer any improvement in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk as compared with carotid endarterectomy, but stenting may reduce non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> morbidity rates associated with some high-risk cases </plain></SENT>
