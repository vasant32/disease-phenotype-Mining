<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The aim of this work was to analyze the cerebral hemodynamics in patients with internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion during <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16526">CO(2)</z:chebi> dynamical tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study was performed using an original mathematical model of cerebral hemodynamics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The model includes the circle of Willis, the microvascular circulation in the territories of each cerebral artery, cortical anastomoses, intracranial pressure, the cerebrospinal fluid circulation, the brain venous circulation and two regulation mechanisms: autoregulation and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16526">CO(2)</z:chebi> reactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Model predictions are compared with real data obtained on 20 healthy subjects (group A) and 14 patients with unilateral ICA stenosis (group B) during <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16526">CO(2)</z:chebi> tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The percent changes in Doppler middle cerebral artery velocity per mm Hg of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16526">CO(2)</z:chebi> pressure variations (reactivity index, RI) were separately computed during <z:mp ids='MP_0003032'>hypocapnia</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002318'>hypercapnia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In group A, the reactivity index was practically the same in both sides </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients in group B had a significantly lower <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16526">CO(2)</z:chebi> reactivity in the side ipsilateral to the occlusion (<z:mp ids='MP_0003032'>hypocapnia</z:mp> RI: 1.06 +/- 1.6 vs. 2.3 +/- 0.8%/mm Hg; <z:mp ids='MP_0002318'>hypercapnia</z:mp>: 0.9 +/- 0.8 vs. 2.4 +/- 1.0%/mm Hg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our model can explain these results very well, assuming values for the diameter of the communicating arteries in the range reported in the clinical literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, computer simulations suggest that patients with a small diameter of both communicating arteries (as low as 0.4-0.5 mm) exhibit a dramatic fall in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16526">CO(2)</z:chebi> reactivity in the ipsilateral side compared with the contralateral one, with the appearance of paradoxical responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A decrease in ipsilateral RI reactivity, however, may also depend on the presence of a significant stenosis of the contralateral ICA </plain></SENT>
