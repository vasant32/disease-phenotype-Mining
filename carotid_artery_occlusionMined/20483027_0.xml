<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, its role in patients that underwent failed endovascular reperfusion remains unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> secondary to internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> who underwent endovascular multimodal reperfusion therapy were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with failed revascularization who were referred for decompressive hemicraniectomy were compared with patients with failed reperfusion who did not undergo decompressive hemicraniectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Functional outcome was assessed with the modified Rankin Score (mRS) and neurological disability with the NIH <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale Score (NIHSS) at 90 days from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Six decompressive hemicraniectomy-treated patients were included (four females, mean age: 36.7 years, mean NIHSS: 24.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>None of the decompressive hemicraniectomy-treated patients died compared to six of seven patients with failed multi-modal reperfusion therapy that did not undergo decompressive hemicraniectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> decompressive hemicraniectomy-treated patients were discharged to a rehabilitation facility whereas the only surviving non-decompressive hemicraniectomy-treated patient was discharged to a nursing facility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Five of the six decompressive hemicraniectomy-treated (84%) and none of the non-decompressive hemicraniectomy-treated patients had an mRS â‰¤ 3 at 90 days post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Decompressive hemicraniectomy can significantly improve functional outcome in patients with large carotid artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> that failed to recanalize following multi-modal reperfusion therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results imply that decompressive hemicraniectomy should be planned in patients who undergo multi-modal reperfusion therapy for large carotid artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
