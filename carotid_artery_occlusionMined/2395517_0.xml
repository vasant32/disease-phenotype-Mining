<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 40-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On admission, no <z:hpo ids='HP_0000707'>neurological abnormality</z:hpo> was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CT scan showed thin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> in the basal cistern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Left vertebral angiograms revealed a basilar bifurcation <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> located in the high position </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Also, the left internal and external carotid arteries were supplied through the anastomotic muscle branches of the left occipital and vertebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The trunk of the left common carotid artery was not visualised from its origin on the aortogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CT scan at the level of C6 showed thinning of the left common carotid artery and contrast enhancement study indicated occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neck clipping of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was successfully performed by right trans-sylvian approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Right zygomatic arch was removed to obtain a wider operative field for avoiding further retraction of the brain tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The postoperative course was uneventful except transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0001289'>disorientation</z:hpo> for two weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It has been well known that internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> may be associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysm</z:hpo> in some cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, it seemed to be a rather rare case that the common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> was associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Hemodynamic factor was positively suggested for aneurysmal formation in this case </plain></SENT>
