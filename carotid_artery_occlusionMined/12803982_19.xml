<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A small reduction of body temperature during reperfusion following <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> has been known to ameliorate neuronal injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the mechanisms underlying postischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo>-induced neuroprotection are poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The burst of reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation that occurs during reperfusion has been documented to be involved in ischemic <z:mp ids='MP_0002229'>neuronal degeneration</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the effect of postischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> on ROS production following transient forebrain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> using an in vivo microdialysis technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Forebrain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was induced by bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> combined with hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> for 20 min in male Wistar rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The body temperature was kept at 37 degrees C during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and controlled at either 32 degrees C or 37 degrees C after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The amount of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29191">hydroxyl radical</z:chebi> produced in striatum was evaluated by measurement of 2,3- and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17189">2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid</z:chebi> (DHBA), which is generated by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30762">salicylate</z:chebi> hydroxylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We also measured the extracellular concentration of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15318,17712">xanthine</z:chebi>, while determining striatal blood flow by the hydrogen clearance technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In animals whose postischemic body temperature was maintained at 37 degrees C, the levels of 2,3- and 2,5-DHBA significantly increased after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The peak levels of 2,3- and 2,5- DHBA were 2.9-fold and 2.7-fold increased above the corresponding baseline values, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Postischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> completely inhibited the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29191">hydroxyl radical</z:chebi> formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Likewise, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15318,17712">xanthine</z:chebi> formation was also inhibited by postischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In contrast, striatal cerebral blood flow was not altered by temperature modulation during reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that inhibition of ROS production accompanied with suppression of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15318,17712">xanthine</z:chebi> formation is implicated in the neuroprotection of postischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
