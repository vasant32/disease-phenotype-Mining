<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>During a 31 month period, 1,433 consecutive patients undergoing cardiac procedures were screened for carotid bruit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 94 patients with carotid bruit were identified who had ultrasonic carotid duplex scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nine patients had a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo>, carotid bruit, and reduction in internal carotid artery diameter by greater than or equal to 50% according to ultrasonic carotid duplex scanning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> nine patients underwent carotid angiography followed by thromboendarterectomy prior to or simultaneous with cardiopulmonary bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was one neurological complication leading to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in this subset </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sixteen patients with asymptomatic carotid bruit had ultrasonic carotid duplex scanning revealing an internal carotid artery lesion of greater than or equal to 50% but did not undergo arteriography or thromboendarterectomy prior to the cardiac procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Perfusion pressure was maintained at greater than or equal to 70 mm Hg during bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no focal neurological events in this subset </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sixty-six patients with internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> of less than 50% diameter reduction and asymptomatic bruits had no further work-up or modification in perfusion technique, and there were no focal neurological events in this group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus there were no focal neurological events in any of the 82 patients with asymptomatic carotid bruit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>An additional group of three patients with a previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> by ultrasonic carotid duplex scanning had transient exacerbation of neurological symptoms after cardiopulmonary bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The remaining 1,339 patients without carotid bruit had nine (0.7%) focal neurological events postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We believe that asymptomatic patients with or without hemodynamically significant stenosis can safely undergo cardiopulmonary bypass procedures without carotid thromboendarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Patients with asymptomatic bruits can be safely screened with ultrasonic carotid duplex scanning and do not require arteriography prior to cardiopulmonary bypass </plain></SENT>
