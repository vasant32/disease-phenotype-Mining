<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Renal vascular resistance (renal arterial pressure kept constant) increased by 15 +/- 7% (P less than 0.05) and the net renal venous outflows (renal venoarterial concentration difference X renal plasma flow) of NE and <z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp> were enhanced (P less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To obtain more correct estimates of the renal contribution to the renal venous <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamine</z:chebi> outflow, we corrected for the renal extraction of arterial <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamines</z:chebi>, assessed as the extractions of [3H]NE, [3H]<z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp>, or endogenous Epi </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The [3H]NE corrected renal NE overflow to plasma increased from 144 +/- 40 to 243 +/- 64 pmol X min-1 (P less than 0.05) during BCO, which, when compared with a previous study of the [3H]NE corrected renal NE overflow to plasma evoked by electrical renal nerve stimulation, "corresponds" to a 40% increase in nerve impulse frequency from approximately 0.6 Hz </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The renal <z:mp ids='MP_0000273'>DA</z:mp> overflow to plasma was about one-fifth of the NE overflow both at rest and during BCO, indicating that there was no preferential activation of noradrenergic or putative dopaminergic nerves by BCO </plain></SENT>
