<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To determine whether microvessels in resting or contracting skeletal muscle constrict during baroreceptor activation, vascular diameters were measured in the spinotrapezius muscle of adult rats (n = 12) during occlusion of the common carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Neural and myogenic components were distinguished using two types of occlusion: 1) "<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>" (arterial pressure was allowed to increase with baroreceptor activation) and 2) "isobaric" (arterial pressure was maintained constant by decreasing blood volume) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> occlusions, intermediate and small arteriolar diameters decreased in resting and contracting muscle (10-15% and 25-30%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Large arterioles and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-sized venules distended slightly (approximately 5%) in resting muscle, but diameters were maintained or decreased in contracting muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When arterial pressure was maintained constant (isobaric), the microvascular responses to baroreceptor activation in both resting and contracting muscle were essentially eliminated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that nearly <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the arteriolar constriction observed in the spinotrapezius muscle during <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> is myogenic in origin, secondary to increased arterial pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This pressure-dependent constriction is augmented during skeletal muscle contraction and functional vasodilation </plain></SENT>
