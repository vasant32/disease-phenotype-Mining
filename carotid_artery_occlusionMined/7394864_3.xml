<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At 0.5 h exposure the right cerebral hemisphere of animals receiving Krebs', <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16724,30830">GHB</z:chebi> or GBL showed equivalent decreases of ATP and phosphocreatine and increase of <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> which indicated that these depressant drugs had no beneficial effect on the energy metabolism of the acutely hypoxic-oligemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a second series of rats in which Krebs' solution, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16724,30830">GHB</z:chebi> or GBL were administered to animals during the early recovery period from 0.5 h hypoxic-oligemic exposure, the brain metabolic patterns of the right hemisphere indicated that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16724,30830">GHB</z:chebi> retarded the restitution of energy phosphates and the oxidation of the accumulated <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi>; whereas, GBL led to a delayed metabolic deterioration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16724,30830">GHB</z:chebi> and GBL do not beneficially alter cerebral energy metabolism during <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-oligemia and that their administration during restitution may result in metabolic alterations which suggest an unfavorable effect </plain></SENT>
