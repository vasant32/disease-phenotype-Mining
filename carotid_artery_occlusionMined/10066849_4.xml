<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Activation of plasma protein C (PC) zymogen by thrombin-thrombomodulin at the endothelial surface is an important endogenous antithrombotic mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is unknown whether activated protein C (APC) is generated in vivo in the cerebrovasculature, because there is only limited thrombomodulin expression in human brain vascular endothelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that carotid occlusion produces brain-specific PC activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Blood samples were simultaneously collected from the ipsilateral internal jugular vein and radial artery before and during carotid cross-clamping and on "de-occlusion" in 8 awake patients undergoing routine carotid endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Plasma PC zymogen and circulating APC levels were measured using enzyme immunocapture assay and expressed as percent of pooled plasma controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Internal jugular vein APC levels increased 28% exclusively during carotid occlusion and then decreased 32% with de-occlusion (F=8.1, P&lt;0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PC zymogen increased only 5.9% with occlusion (F=6.3, P&lt;0.02), consistent with hemoconcentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no changes in radial artery PC or APC levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate brain-specific protein C activation in humans during carotid occlusion and suggest a protective role for endogenous APC generation during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596298" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebrovascular occlusion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
