<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> who visited the hospital within 3 hours of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> between April 2007 and September 2009, 127 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> in the anterior circulation region in whom head magnetic resonance imaging (diffusion-weighted imaging [DWI]) or MRA was performed (81 men and 46 women; mean age, 71 ± 11 years) were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Major artery lesions (+) were defined as internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and middle cerebral artery (M1/M2 segment) occlusion and ≥50% stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Based on the presence or absence of major artery lesions and the size of DWI lesions, the subjects were divided into 3 groups: MRA-DWI mismatch (+) group [major artery lesion (+) and DWI-ASPECTS ≥6], MRA-DWI mismatch (-) group [major artery lesion (+) and DWI-ASPECTS &lt;6], and major artery lesion (-) group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IV t-PA was given to 21 of the 64 patients in the MRA-DWI mismatch (+) group, to 1 of the 24 patients in the MRA-DWI mismatch (-) group, and to 9 of the 39 patients in the major artery lesion (-) group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the MRA-DWI mismatch (+) group (n = 64), the median National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) score on admission was higher in t-PA-treated patients than in t-PA-untreated patients (15 vs 11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The modified Rankin scale (mRS) score at day 90 after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> was more favorable in t-PA-treated patients (0-2 in 10 patients [48%] and 3-6 in 11 patients [52%]) than in t-PA-untreated patients (0-2 in 12 patients [28%] and 3-6 in 31 patients [72%]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After adjusting for admission NIHSS score, there was a significant difference in outcome (mRS score) between t-PA-treated patients (0-2 in 10 patients [48%] and 3-6 in 11 patients [52%]) and t-PA-untreated patients (0-2 in 3 patients [9%] and 3-6 in 29 patients [91%]) (P = .002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the MRA-DWI mismatch (-) group (n = 24), mRS scores at day 90 after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> were poor in both t-PA-treated (3-6 in 1 patient [100%]) and t-PA-untreated patients (0-2 in 1 patient [4%] and 3-6 in 22 patients [96%]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the major artery lesion (-) group (n = 39), mRS scores at day 90 after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> were favorable in both t-PA-treated (0-2 in 9 patients [100%]) and t-PA-untreated patients (0-2 in 28 patients [93%] and 3-6 in 2 patients [7%]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>When comparing major artery lesions in the MRA-DWI mismatch (+) group, outcomes were more favorable in patients with M1/M2 segment lesions who received t-PA than in those who did not receive t-PA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the MRA-DWI mismatch (+) group, the prognosis was significantly better for t-PA-treated patients than for t-PA-untreated patients, suggesting that IV t-PA is indicated in patients with MRA-DWI mismatch </plain></SENT>
