<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Morphological changes characterizing delayed neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (DND) of selectively vulnerable CA1 pyramidal cells in the hippocampus of the Mongolian gerbil brain occurred 72 h after transient (5 min) bilateral occlusion of the common carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Different groups of animals were treated 15 min before carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and twice daily during the 72 h post-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> period with either saline alone, nicardipine, flunarizine, lidoflazine or nimodipine at doses of 500 micrograms kg-1 intraperitoneally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 72 h the animals were killed and their brains examined histologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Absolute cell counts were made from 5 sites distributed linearly throughout the hippocampal CA1 subfield in each hemisphere to determine the percentage DND in each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> brains and those of sham-operated animals were included in the study for comparison </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Features of DND were distributed evenly throughout the CA1 subfield in both hemispheres in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups of gerbils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Nicardipine, lidoflazine and flunarizine, but not nimodipine, were protective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This protection extended linearly throughout the hippocampus without altering the pattern of neuronal damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Compared to saline-treated (78.3 +/- 2.9% DND) and nimodipine-treated (76.5 +/- 3.4% DND) gerbils, the overall protection afforded by nicardipine (41.8 +/- 3.8% DND) was statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The effects of lidoflazine (53.6 +/- 7.1%) and flunarizine (55.8 +/- 3.9% DND) were of borderline significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Abnormal neurones appeared in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and sham-operated brains to the extent of 4.5 +/- 1.0% and 4.6 +/- 0.4%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Such changes can be attributed to fixation artefacts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>The results demonstrate that overall protection is conferred on ischaemic hippocampal CA1 neurones by nicardipine and to a lesser extent by flunarizine and lidoflazine, but not by nimodipine </plain></SENT>
