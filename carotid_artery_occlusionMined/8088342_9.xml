<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, the current lead compound, U-92032 ((7-((bis-4-fluorophenyl)<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>)-1-piperazinyl)-2-(2-hydroxyethylamin o)- 4-(<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30353">1-methylethyl</z:chebi>)-2,4,6-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="37519">cycloheptatrien</z:chebi>-1-one), has been compared with flunarizine and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7565">nifedipine</z:chebi> (well-known T- and L-type <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> channel <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonists</z:chebi>, respectively) for their effects on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> channels in a mouse neuronal cell line, N1E-115 cells, and their ability to preserve the phenomenon of long-term potentiation and to improve neurological symptoms in gerbil ischemic models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>U-92032, like flunarizine, blocked transient Ba2+ currents (IBa) through T-type <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29108">Ca2+</z:chebi> channels with no effect on <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7565">nifedipine</z:chebi>-sensitive non-inactivating currents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transient IBa was reduced by U-92032 at a constant rate, the magnitude of which depended on the drug concentration, probably because of a time-dependent accumulation of the lipophilic drug in the membrane phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For instance, the drug at 6 microM reduced IBa by 21% per min and abolished it in less than 5 min, about 3 times faster than flunarizine at the same concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Otherwise, U-92032 behaved like flunarizine, showing a use-dependent block without noticeable effects on the current-voltage relationship for transient IBa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Oral administration of U-92032 (1 and 25 mg/kg) or flunarizine (25 mg/kg), but not <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7565">nifedipine</z:chebi> (50 mg/kg), to gerbils 1 h prior to bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, preserved long-term potentiation in hippocampal CA1 neurons, which were largely abolished by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> without the drug treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
