<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five ewes (117-124 d of gestation) were assigned to one of four groups: 1) <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-infused fetuses exposed to 30 min of carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> followed by 48 h of reperfusion (I/R-Glu, n = 8); 2) <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-infused plus rapid <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> injection given 100 min before 30 min of occlusion followed by 48 h of reperfusion (I/R-GluR, n = 4); 3) placebo-infused exposed to 30 min of occlusion and 48 h of reperfusion (I/R-PL, n = 8); and 4) <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-infused sham occlusion and 48 h of sham reperfusion (control, n = 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After baseline measurements, fetuses were infused with <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> (9-16 mg/kg/min) for 48 h before and after carotid occlusion or sham treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The I/R-PL group received 0.9% <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Brain pathologic outcome was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serial sections stained with Luxol fast blue-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin were scored for white matter, cerebral cortical, and hippocampal lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These areas received graded pathologic scores of 0 to 5, reflecting the amount of injury, where 0 = 0%, 1 = 1-25%, 2 = 26-50%, 3 = 51-75%, 4 = 76-95%, and 5 = 96-100% of the area damaged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Comparisons of the pathologic scores for cerebral cortex (CC), white matter (WM), and hippocampus (H) demonstrated that the I/R-GluR (CC: 4.56 +/- 0.11, WM: 4.50 +/- 0.11, H: 3.44 +/- 0.48, mean +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) had more (p &lt; 0.05) damage than the I/R-Glu (CC: 2.46 +/- 0.47, WM: 1.97 +/- 0.37, H: 1.81 +/- 0.36) and control (CC: 1.12 +/- 0.13, WM: 0.82 +/- 0.34, H: 0.80 +/- 0.34) groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The pathologic scores in the I/R-Glu were (p &lt; 0.05) greater than the control, but not the I/R-PL (CC: 2.12 +/- 0.35, WM: 2.20 +/- 0.44, H: 1.59 +/- 0.41) group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that exposure to prolonged moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> before <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and during reperfusion does not affect the extent of brain injury, but exposure to an additional <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> increase in plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> concentration before <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> is extremely detrimental to the fetal brain </plain></SENT>
