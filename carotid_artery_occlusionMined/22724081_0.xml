<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it is unknown whether <z:chebi fb="32" ids="30145">lithium</z:chebi> treatment protects against brain injury post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in a rat model of permanent distal middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAo) combined with transient bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (CCAo), a model that mimics human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> with partial reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, whether <z:chebi fb="32" ids="30145">lithium</z:chebi> treatment alters Akt activity as measured by the kinase activity assay has not been reported, although it is known to inhibit GSK3β activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, Akt activity contributes to neuronal survival while GSK3β activity causes neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We report that a bolus of <z:chebi fb="32" ids="30145">lithium</z:chebi> injection at <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> robustly reduced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size measured by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> (TTC) staining at 48 h post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and inhibited cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in the ischemic penumbra, but not in the ischemic core, as shown by TUNEL staining performed 24 h post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, <z:chebi fb="32" ids="30145">lithium</z:chebi> treatment did not alter the reduction in Akt activity as measured by Akt kinase assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We further showed that <z:chebi fb="32" ids="30145">lithium</z:chebi> did not alter phosphorylated GSK3β protein levels, or the degradation of β-catenin, a substrate of GSK3β, which is consistent with previous findings that long-term treatment is required for <z:chebi fb="32" ids="30145">lithium</z:chebi> to alter GSK3�� phosphorylation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In summary, we show innovative data that <z:chebi fb="32" ids="30145">lithium</z:chebi> protects against <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in a focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> model with partial reperfusion, however, our results dispute the importance of Akt activity in the protective effects of <z:chebi fb="32" ids="30145">lithium</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
