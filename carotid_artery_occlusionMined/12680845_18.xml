<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rat bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (BCAO) was used as a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1695782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral hypoperfusion</z:e> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We observed autoradiographically the long-term changes in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and regional cerebral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> utilization (rCGU) after 2 days and 1, 4 and 8 weeks of BCAO and in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Regions evaluated included the cerebral cortex, white matter and basal ganglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pathological changes were also observed with Kl√ºver-Barrera and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">haematoxylin</z:chebi>-eosin staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After 2 days, rCBF was significantly reduced to 33-58% in the cortex, white matter and amygdala and similar reductions were observed after 1 week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After 4 weeks, rCBF recovered; however, rCBF remained significantly reduced in the occipital cortex, white matter, globus pallidus and substantia nigra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After 2 days, rCGU was mostly maintained but, after 1 week, rCGU was reduced significantly to 40-70% in the cortex, white matter, basal ganglia and thalamus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Four weeks later, these reductions were no longer seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Rarefaction of the white matter was observed from 1 week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>These results showed that the BCAO in rats is an appropriate model for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1695782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral hypoperfusion</z:e> and that uncoupling of rCBF and rCGU was observed from 2 days until 4 weeks in the white matter </plain></SENT>
