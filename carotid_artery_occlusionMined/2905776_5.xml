<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We tested the hypothesis that the increase in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51349">polyamines</z:chebi> observed after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> is related to deficits in electrocortical function as measured by somatosensory evoked potential (SEP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Adult Mongolian gerbils were anaesthetized with ketamine and prepared for monitoring SEP, cerebral blood flow (CBF) in parietal and frontal regions by H2 clearance, and for bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (BCO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seven animals served as controls and received saline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Another 7 animals were treated with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18257">ornithine</z:chebi> decarboxylase inhibitor, difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) (100 mg/kg I.P.) just prior to 40 min BCO followed by 4 h reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With BCO, both CBF and SEP declined significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In control animals, CBF fell from basal 37.8 +/- 4.7 cc/100 g/min to 2.9 +/- 1.2 cc/100 g/min and recovered to 22.7 +/- 3.5 cc/100 g/h over the 4 h reperfusion period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DFMO treatment did not alter this CBF pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SEP amplitude declined to 11.3 +/- 3.2% basal during occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DFMO preserved SEP during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> (35.5 +/- 16.8% basal) and remained significantly more preserved during reperfusion (p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51349">polyamines</z:chebi> are involved in the progressive decline in neuroelectrical function which occurs during occlusion/reperfusion in the Mongolian gerbil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The observation that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51349">polyamine</z:chebi> inhibition preserves electrical function despite not altering blood flow indicates that the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51349">polyamines</z:chebi> are not manifested at the level of the vasculature but perhaps at the neuronal membrane </plain></SENT>
