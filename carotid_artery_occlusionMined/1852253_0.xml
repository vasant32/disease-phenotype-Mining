<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 63-year-old man was hospitalized for sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of black-out after urination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>He was alert, and no neurological deficit was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MRI showed multiple lacunae in the bilateral putamens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cerebral angiogram demonstrated severe stenosis of the left internal carotid artery at its cervical segment and complete occlusion of the left external carotid artery at its origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The ascending pharyngeal artery originated from the left internal carotid artery above its stenotic lesion and the superior thyroid artery originated from the left common carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The sternocleidomastoid branch from the left superior thyroid artery and the muscular branch from the left vertebral artery anastomosed with the muscular branch of the ascending pharyngeal artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The ascending pharyngeal artery maintained patency of the internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is important to perform vertebral angiography when there is proximal occlusion and severe stenosis of the internal carotid artery, and when the ascending pharyngeal artery has not been clearly identified as a branch from the ipsilateral external carotid artery on the common carotid angiogram </plain></SENT>
