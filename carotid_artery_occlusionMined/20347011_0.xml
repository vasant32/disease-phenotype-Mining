<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study demonstrates that early-activated microglia in the hilus of the DG play an important role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Transient forebrain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> induced by 20min of bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (BCCAO) significantly <z:mp ids='MP_0000351'>increased cell proliferation</z:mp> in the SGZ of the DG beginning 4 days post-reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, BCCAO increased microglial activation in the hilus of the DG from 1 day post-reperfusion and in the CA1 layer from 4 days post-reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An injection of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50694">minocycline</z:chebi> (10 or 100nmol in 0.5microl) into the DG immediately after reperfusion decreased microglial activation in the hilus of the DG 1 day post-reperfusion, but only a high dose of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50694">minocycline</z:chebi> (100nmol) significantly decreased microglial activation in the CA1 layer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both high and low doses of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50694">minocycline</z:chebi> significantly decreased the number of BrdU-positive cells at 7 days post-reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that early-activated microglia in the hilus of the DG take part in the cell proliferation induced by transient forebrain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
