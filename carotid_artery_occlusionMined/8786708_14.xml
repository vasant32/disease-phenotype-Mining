<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Forebrain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was produced by bilaterally occluding the common carotid arteries for 10 minutes; then the blood supply to the brain was restored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The number of survivors was counted for 8 days, and the histopathological damage in the CA1 region of the hippocampus was scored according to the semiquantitative scale of Rudolphi and Colleagues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When intraperitoneally injected immediately after the ischemic attack, 2,6-diisopropylphenol (25, 50, 100 mg kg-1) produced no significant reduction in the rate of mortality in comparison with its vehicle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the survivors that had received the compound at the dose of 50 and 100 mg kg-1 elicited a significant increase in the number of viable pyramidal cells in the CA1 hippocampal region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we obtained similar results by injecting the compound 30 minutes after the release of the carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that 2,6-diisopropylphenol, although it does not show any capability of improving the rate of survival, it elicits protective properties against the transient forebrain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced delayed hippocampal neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
