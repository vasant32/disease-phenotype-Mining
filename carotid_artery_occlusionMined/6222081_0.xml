<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The rapid <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of bilateral internal carotid occlusion would be expected to produce devastating neurological sequelae and probably not be compatible with survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We present a case of a young man with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">complete obstruction</z:e> of both internal carotid arteries whose presenting symptoms were those of a visual field cut </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The history suggests that the carotid occlusion occurred as a result of blunt trauma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patient had no known predisposition to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002597'>vascular abnormalities</z:hpo> (no history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003077'>hyperlipidemia</z:hpo>, signs of systematic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo>, and an unremarkable family history for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002597'>vascular abnormalities</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Computerized tomography revealed an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> in his right parietal lobe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Angiography demonstrated complete occlusion of both internal carotid arteries and the right posterior communicating artery and failed to disclose the development of extensive collatorals, adding further evidence to the acuteness of the occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The patient was followed by noninvasive studies and in the subsequent year showed marked neurological and ophthalmological improvement </plain></SENT>
