<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2) and oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) were measured by PET before and after intravenous loading of brovincamine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Brovincamine increased CBF and decreased OEF significantly on the occluded side of the hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CMRO2 did not show any remarkable changes upon brovincamine administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It was concluded that brovincamine might be useful for increasing the hemodynamic reserve, but did not affect the metabolic state immediately after its administration </plain></SENT>
