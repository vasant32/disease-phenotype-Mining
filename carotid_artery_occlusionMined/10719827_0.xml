<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred forty-seven Mongolian gerbils were separated into four groups for which a bicarotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> lasted for 4, 6, 8, or 10 minutes, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The animals were scanned before carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and at 3, 6, 10, 24, and 48 hours and 5 days after the ischemic incident </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images were acquired on a Bruker Avance DRX300 mini-imaging system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Our results show that T2 mapping is able to localize brain damage induced by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">transient ischemia</z:e> and to detect early perturbations in water content (as early as 6 hours after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: T2 measurements in the striata are correlated with the severity of the ischemic incident, since the changes observed on the T2 images are directly proportional to the duration of occlusion </plain></SENT>
