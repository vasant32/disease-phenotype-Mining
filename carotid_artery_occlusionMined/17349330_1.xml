<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared 2,959 carotid endarterectomies performed in patients with patent contralateral internal carotid artery to 373 carotid endarterectomies performed in patients with occlusion of the contralateral carotid artery in the same institute between 1988 and 2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patient demographics, surgical and anesthesiological strategy, perioperative neurological and cardiac events, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients were grouped and analyzed according to the presence or absence of symptoms and to their gender </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No significant difference was shown in perioperative cardiological and neurological events and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in patients with contralateral carotid occlusion versus patients without contralateral carotid occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Females had significant more neurological events than males, in both the asymptomatic (P &lt; 0.001) and symptomatic (P = 0.02) groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Concomitant occlusion of the contralateral carotid artery was not associated with increased risk of perioperative cardiological or neurological adverse events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, female gender was associated with higher risk for adverse neurological events </plain></SENT>
