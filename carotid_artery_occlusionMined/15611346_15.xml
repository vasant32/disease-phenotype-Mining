<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several protective regimens have proved effective in the short-term but not in the long-term perspective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study, therefore, was to evaluate the PC effect on long-term morphologic and neurologic outcome in the developing brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Six-day-old rats were subjected to <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> (36 degrees C, 8.0% O2; PC/HI group) and sham controls to normoxia (36 degrees C; HI group) for 3 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four hours later, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> rats were exposed to cerebral HI produced by unilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> combined with 1 h, 15 min of <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> (36 degrees C, 7.7% O2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A cylinder test was used to evaluate forelimb asymmetry to determine sensorimotor function at 4, 6, and 8 wk of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Spatial/cognitive ability was assessed by <z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water maze</z:mp> trials at 7 wk of recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neuropathologic analysis was performed 8 wk after insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Brain damage was reduced (p&lt;0.0001) in PC/HI (45.0+/-11.1 mm3) in comparison with HI (159.3+/-12.2 mm3) rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A bias for using the ipsilateral forelimb in wall movements was observed in the cylinder test in HI compared with PC/HI rats at 4 (p&lt;0.001), 6 (p&lt;0.01), and 8 (p&lt;0.0001) wk of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Results of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water maze</z:mp> test revealed differences (p&lt;0.0001) in average path length between groups on the third and fourth day of trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Hypoxic PC before HI reduced brain injury by 72% at 8 wk after the insult and provided long-term improvement of sensorimotor and spatial/cognitive functions </plain></SENT>
