<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: It is a pilot study presented as a case series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ten animals were subjected to anterior deep cervical fascia dissection using standard endoscopic instrumentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Balloon dissection and <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> insufflation poses a number of problems: <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> gas dissection into the chest, <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> gas embolism into the venous circulation, carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, and limited visualization causing increased risk of injury to adjacent structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These issues need to be dealt with before such a method could be employed safely in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, with further research and development, endoscopic neck surgery may someday become a reality </plain></SENT>
