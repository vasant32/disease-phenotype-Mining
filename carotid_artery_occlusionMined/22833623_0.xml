<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The clinical outcomes of patients with tandem occlusion of the ICA and middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) who underwent recanalization by a modified PS technique after carotid artery stenting during the period December 2009 to June 2011 were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Five patients with tandem occlusion of the ICA and <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean National Institute of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) score on admission was 13 (range 9-18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median time from symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> to arrival at hospital was 260 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median time lag between arrival at hospital and intra-arterial administration was 70 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Recanalization by stenting of carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was successfully performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean number of recanalizations using the modified PS technique for distally migrated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> was 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Complete recanalization of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> was observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Symptomatic <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> transformation did not occur during the hospital stay in any of the subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At discharge, the mean NIHSS score was 2.2 (range 1-6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At the 3-month follow-up the modified Rankin Scale was excellent in three of the five patients, good in one patient and poor in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The modified PS technique after carotid artery stenting is a safe and effective treatment for patients with a massive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> extending into the distal portion of the ICA and a tandem occlusion of the ICA and <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
