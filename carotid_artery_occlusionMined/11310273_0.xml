<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the presence of anterior-posterior arterial communication in the Mongolian gerbil (Meriones unguiculatus) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: 26 animals were used and divided in the following groups: 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Bilateral carotid ligation (n = 10); 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Unilateral left carotid ligation (n = 5); 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Unilateral carotid right carotid ligation (n = 5); and 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Control group without carotid ligation (n = 6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Postmortem intra-aortic dye injection demonstrated communication between anterior and posterior cerebral arteries in 30% of gerbils that previously were subjected to bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A number of vessels, between 8.95-11.35 microns in diameter, were linking the basilar artery with the posterior cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the remaining animals, the absence of communication was confirmed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Communicating carotid-basilar in lower number of cases and anastomosis the smallest diameter to give the gerbil advantage on others species as model of experimental regional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
