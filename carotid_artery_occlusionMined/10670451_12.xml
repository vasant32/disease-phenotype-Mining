<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Post insult administration of insulin-like growth factor-1 is neuroprotective, particularly in the striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Insulin-like growth factor-1 is also known to be a neuromodulator of several types of striatal neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The striatum comprises various phenotypic neurons with a complex neurochemical <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we examined the specificity of neuronal rescue with insulin-like growth factor-1 on different striatal neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Bilateral brain injury was induced in near term fetal sheep by 30 min of reversible carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A single dose of 3 microg of insulin-like growth factor-1 was infused over 1 h into the lateral ventricle 90 min following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The histological and immunohistochemical outcome were examined after 4 days recovery using paraffin tissue preparations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Insulin-like growth factor-1 treatment (n = 11) significantly reduced the percentage of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo> in the striatum compared with the vehicle treated group (n = 10, 28.3+/-5.1% vs 55.5+/-17.3%, P &lt; 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical studies showed that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> resulted in a significant loss of calbindin-28kd, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi> acetyltransferase, parvalbumin, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> acid decarboxylase, neuronal nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase and neuropeptide Y immunopositive neurons, compared with sham controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Insulin-like growth factor-1 markedly prevented the loss of calbindin-28kd (n = 7, P &lt; 0.05), <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi> acetyltransferase (n = 7, P &lt; 0.05), neuropeptide Y (n = 7, P &lt; 0.05), neuronal nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (n = 8, P &lt; 0.05) and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> acid decarboxylase (n = 9, P &lt; 0.05) immunopositive neurons, but failed to protect parvalbumin (n = 6) immunopositive neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The present study indicates that the therapeutic effect of insulin-like growth factor-1 in the basal ganglia is selectively associated with cholinergic and some phenotypic GABAergic neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These data suggest a potential role for insulin-like growth factor-1 in preventing <z:hpo ids='HP_0100021'>cerebral palsy</z:hpo> due to perinatal asphyxia </plain></SENT>
