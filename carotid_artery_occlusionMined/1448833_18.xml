<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Brain temperature during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> is known to strongly influence the extent of cellular injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objectives of the present study were to determine the effect of severe focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> on brain temperature and to assess the influence of those changes on focal infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Severe focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was produced in rats using permanent occlusion of the distal middle cerebral artery combined with transient (60-minute) bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The temperature of the ischemic focus was measured with a small subdural probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three groups of rats were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the first group, brain temperature was permitted to decline spontaneously to 32 degrees C after occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the second, brain temperature was maintained at 37.5 degrees C during occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the third group, the brain temperature was maintained at 37.5 degrees C for 40 minutes postocclusion before cooling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After recovery for 24 hours, the volume of infarction was measured in histological sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the absence of cranial heating, the brain temperature fell to 33 degrees C by 10 minutes postocclusion, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume was 19 +/- 9 mm3 (mean +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>; n = 6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Maintaining brain temperature at 37.5 degrees C increased the volume of infarction to 82 +/- 16 mm3 (n = 7; p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Delayed cooling did not prevent the increase in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> volume (75 +/- 16 mm3; n = 6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that in the present model of transient focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, spontaneous cooling of the brain during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> diminishes the extent of focal infarction, relative to that observed when cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> is prevented or delayed for 40 minutes </plain></SENT>
