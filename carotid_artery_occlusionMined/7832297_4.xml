<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: This study examined the effects of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi> on arterial pressure after central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>) pressor site stimulation in anesthetized cats, cats rendered unconscious by midcollicular transection, and conscious cats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two anesthetized groups and two nonanesthetized groups were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cats were anesthetized with either alpha-chloralose and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="17967">urethane</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7983">pentobarbital</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nonanesthetized groups were cats with midcollicular transections or conscious cats with chronically implanted electrodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Stimulating electrodes were placed into vasomotor areas of the hypothalamus (HYP), reticular formation (RF), and medulla, and arterial pressure responses to increasing stimulus currents were examined during different <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi> concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two groups of cats were also anesthetized with either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7983">pentobarbital</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="5" ids="17967">urethane</z:chebi> and underwent bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Stimulation at each <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> site produced increases in arterial pressure and heart rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">Halothane</z:chebi> attenuated pressor responses evoked by stimulation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> loci in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups of cats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The inhibition by <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi> on these cardiovascular responses was greatest at HYP and RF sites, while the medulla was more resistant to the effects of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi> in the anesthetized animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Midcollicular transection decreased this medullary resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The inhibition of pressor responses by <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi> was also greater in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7983">pentobarbital</z:chebi>-than chloralose <z:chebi fb="5" ids="17967">urethane</z:chebi>-anesthetized animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In contrast, pressor responses elicited by bilateral carotid occlusion were attenuated by <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi> similarly in both <z:chebi fb="164" ids="38867">anesthetic</z:chebi> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Reticular formation stimulation in conscious animals resulted in "altering responses" in addition to pressor effects, both of which were attenuated by <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Modulation of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> cardiovascular control centers contribute to <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi>-induced hemodynamic alterations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Baseline anesthesia, <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> stimulation site, and the suprabulbar system influence the effects of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
