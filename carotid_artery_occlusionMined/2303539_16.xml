<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To clarify this issue, we determined the carbohydrate and energy status of cerebral tissue using enzymatic, fluorometric techniques in an experimental model of perinatal hypoxic-ischemic brain damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seven-day postnatal rats were subjected to unilateral common carotid artery ligation followed by 3 h of <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> with 8% oxygen at 37 degrees C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This insult is known to produce tissue injury (selective neuronal <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> or infarction) predominantly in the cerebral hemisphere ipsilateral to the carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in 92% of the animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rat pups were quick-frozen in liquid nitrogen at 0, 1, 4, 12, 24, or 72 h of recovery; littermate controls underwent neither ligation nor <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">Glucose</z:chebi> in both cerebral hemispheres was nearly completely exhausted during <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, with concurrent increases in <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> to 10 mmol/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During recovery, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> promptly increased above control values, suggesting an inhibition of glycolytic flux, as documented in the ipsilateral cerebral hemisphere by measurement of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> utilization (CMRglc) at 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Tissue <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> declined rapidly during recovery but remained slightly elevated in the ipsilateral hemisphere for 12 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Phosphocreatine (P approximately Cr) and ATP in the ipsilateral cerebral hemisphere were 14 and 26% of control (p less than 0.001) at the end of <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>; total <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16708">adenine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="9" ids="36976">nucleotides</z:chebi> (ATP + <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi> + <z:chebi fb="47" ids="16027,28971">AMP</z:chebi>) also were partially depleted (-46%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
