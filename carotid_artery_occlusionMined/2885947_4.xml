<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The most striking effect was on dynorphin A immunoreactivity, which was reduced by 30-40% as early as 1 hour after recirculation and remained at 50% of the control level for at least 1 week </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although these cells remain histologically intact, the decrease in dynorphin level precedes and continues during the delayed loss of hippocampal CA1 neurons characteristic of this model and further defines the selective vulnerability of hippocampal circuitry following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
