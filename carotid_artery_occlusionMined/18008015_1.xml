<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the association of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005294'>arterial dissection</z:hpo> with the etiology of some <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> of the dorsal or anterior wall of the carotid artery, carotid trunk or "<z:mp ids='MP_0001208'>blister</z:mp>-like" <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> has increased the interest in the description of dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, as they are difficult to treat and require non-habitual surgical techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We present the case of a patient that presented with a poor grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> secondary to a right carotid artery dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> characterised in angiography by a carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> accompanied by a post-stenotic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> and the finding of a saccular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> that increased in size in the follow-up study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A carotid occlusion test showed an asymmetry in the opacification of the venous phase indicating the need for a revascularization procedure prior to arterial sacrifice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A high flow EC-IC bypass was performed using a saphenous vein graft prior to right carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> without morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eight months after the procedure the patient is free of neurological deficit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Control image studies demonstrate the resolution of the carotid lesion and the bypass permeability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We discuss the difficulties in the diagnosis of these <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo>, their clinical and imaging characteristics and the problems related to their treatment as they often require arterial sacrifice with or without prior cerebral revascularization </plain></SENT>
