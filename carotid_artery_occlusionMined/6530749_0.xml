<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">Lactate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15422">adenosine triphosphate</z:chebi> (ATP) in the brain were measured as indicators of the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Microscopic changes in the lung were arbitrarily scored from 0 (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>) to 3 points (severely affected) by the grade and the extent of lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mean arterial pressure (MAP) was also measured through the cannulated femoral artery before and after carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in a separate group of animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cerebral <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> was increased while ATP decreased in ischemic animals in which pulmonary changes such as <z:mp ids='MP_0010909'>intra-alveolar hemorrhages</z:mp> were prominent and frequent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The lung pathology score averaged 1.3 in animals with severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (<z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> greater than or equal to 10 mM/Kg), 0.7 in moderate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (5-10 mM/Kg) and 0.3 in mild or no <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (less than 5 mM/Kg), respectively, suggesting that severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> may cause fulminant pulmonary changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mechanism of pulmonary lesions in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> is discussed </plain></SENT>
