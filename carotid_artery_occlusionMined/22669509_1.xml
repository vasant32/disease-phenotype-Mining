<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This action is mediated by the interleukin-6 (IL-6) pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, as the expression patterns of PACAP receptors and IL-6 following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> are not understood, we evaluated them in the mouse hippocampus in response to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> induced by bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Real-time PCR determination of PAC1R <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression in the hippocampus was significantly elevated on day 7 after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>VPAC1R <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was significantly decreased 3 days after the ischemic episode, while VPAC2R <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression showed a nonsignificant tendency to increase on day 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>IL-6 mRNA expression was significantly increased on day 3 and peaked on day 7 after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of activity-dependent neuroprotective protein, which is a neuroprotective factor stimulated by PACAP, remained virtually unchanged in response to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>IL-6 immunoreactivity was detected in the CA1 pyramidal cell layer and colocalized with the neuronal marker NeuN on day 1 after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On day 3, irregularly shaped IL-6-immunopositive cells colocalized with the astrocytic marker glial fibrillary acidic protein but not with the microglial marker Iba1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>PAC1R immunoreactivity co-labeled with IL-6 immunoreactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that PACAP could stimulate IL-6 secretion by neurons during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase after an ischemic episode and thereafter by astrocytes during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> phase </plain></SENT>
