<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this experiment the authors methodically examined the dose-dependent effects of two NOS inhibitors and two NO donors on cortical infarction volume in an animal model of temporary focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> simulating potential <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> during neurovascular interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ninety-two Wistar rats underwent 3 hours of combined left middle cerebral artery and bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> after having been anesthetized with 1% <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A selective neuronal NOS inhibitor, 7-nitroindazole (7-NI), was administered intraperitoneally in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28262">dimethyl sulfoxide</z:chebi> (DMSO) 60 minutes before <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was induced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two ischemic control groups, to which either saline or DMSO was administered, were also included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seventy-two hours after flow restoration, the animals were perfused with tetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> for histological evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cortical infarction volume was significantly reduced by 71% in the group treated with 1 mg/kg L-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NAME</z:e> when compared with the saline-treated ischemic control group (27.1+/-37 mm3 compared with 92.5+/-26 mm3, p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The NOS inhibitor 7-NI significantly reduced cortical infarction volume by 70% and by 92% at doses of 10 and 100 mg/kg: 35.2+/-32 mm3 (p &lt; 0.05) and 9+/-13 mm3 (p &lt; 0.005), respectively, when compared with the DMSO-treated ischemic control group (119+/-43 mm3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference between the saline-treated and DMSO-treated ischemic control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Treatment with NO donors did not significantly alter cortical infarction volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results support an important role for NO in ischemic neurotoxicity and indicate that neuronal NOS inhibition may be valuable in reducing cortical injury in patients suffering temporary focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> during neurovascular procedures </plain></SENT>
