<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is shown that introduction of short <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> promotes a survival rate of the animals that have modeled occlusion of carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Under Pinealon before occlusion of carotid arteries, behavioral dream has been increased and a position-finding behavior, a motivational behavior and a motor performance have been reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The rats that were introduced Cortexin before carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arteries occlusion</z:mp> demonstrated the raise of behavioral dream time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At introduction of Pinealon activity of caspase-3 moderately raises in false-operated animals and in a model of occlusion of carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
