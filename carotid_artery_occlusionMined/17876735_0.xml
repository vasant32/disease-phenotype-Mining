<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Because the contralateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> has been considered a high risk factor for ipsilateral carotid endarterectomy, some authors indicate a stenting procedure in these cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM: To evaluate whether there are different preoperative factors in patients with contralateral carotid occlusion and if the latter is associated to worse perioperative outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analysed 476 carotid endarterectomies performed in 1994-2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>57 cases (12.0%) had contralateral carotid occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We analysed the results in patients with contralateral carotid occlusion and we compared them with the patients with contralateral patency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Prospective cohort study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no differences in preoperative risk factors or comorbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Contralateral occlusion was associated to preoperative symptoms: 75.4-58.9%; OR: 1.2 (1.1-1.5); p = 0.02 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The patients operated on under local anaesthesia who had contralateral occlusion and previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, had a higher rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> during carotid cross-clamping: 66.7-11.3%; RR: 5.8 (3.1-10.9); p = 0.002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Morbimortality was 2.3% in the global series and 0.0% in patients with contralateral carotid occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Over 80-year-old patients with contralateral carotid occlusion had a higher global rate of cardiac complications: 28.6-0.0% (p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In our series, patients with contralateral carotid occlusion do not have a higher risk preoperative profile o higher perioperative morbimortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Contralateral carotid occlusion does not justify, by itself, the endovascular treatment of an ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
