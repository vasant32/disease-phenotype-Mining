<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cervical bruits, generally localized to the carotid bifurcation, were highly associated (P = 0.004) with "tight" (residual lumen less than or equal to 2 mm) internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp>, but significantly less often with a widely patent or occluded internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Angiographic features of a "slow-flow" state through a patent, but "tight" stenosis were identified as the apparent explanation for the absence of bruit in some patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A unilateral ocular bruit contralateral to the side of internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> occurred in 9 of 10 patients, more often than an associated cervical bruit, and was interpreted as a sign of augmentation flow </plain></SENT>
