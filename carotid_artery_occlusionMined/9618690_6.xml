<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the timing and pattern of neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> has not been extensively studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To further our understanding of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, we examined the temporal profile of histochemical and morphologic characteristics of hippocampal neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> following experimental forebrain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and compared these findings to human brain specimens obtained from subjects suffering <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transient forebrain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (TFI) was induced in normothermic adult rats by bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> combined with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Animals were sacrificed at 6, 12, 18, 24, 48, and 72 h and 7, 14, and 28 days following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (n = 4 at each time point) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Experimental tissue was analyzed using light and electron microscopy as well as TUNEL histochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total of 27 human brain specimens with neuropathological confirmation of ischemic damage and appropriate controls were also examined using light microscopy and TUNEL histochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Dense TUNEL staining in hippocampal CA-1 neurons was present at 48 and 72 h following experimental <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Prior to these times, little or no nuclear staining was noted and after 72 h nuclear staining diminished rapidly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ultrastructural findings at these time points demonstrated many features similar to those seen in cells undergoing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, such as cell shrinkage with increased electron density, chromatin condensation with formation of heterochromatin, intact plasma membranes, and intact intracellular organelles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In a similar fashion, human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> specimens during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> period showed dense nuclear TUNEL staining in penumbral neurons, whereas in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> stages little or no staining was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrate that the timing of morphologic changes and TUNEL histochemistry following human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> resembles that observed in experimental TFI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in both experimental <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and human <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> share several features characteristic of apoptotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
