<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Brain tissue <z:hpo ids='HP_0001941'>acidosis</z:hpo> can result from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> when cerebral blood flow reduction reaches a critical value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The portable, battery-operated Khuri pH monitor has been used previously in a large number of patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass surgery to monitor the intramyocardial pH during aortic clamping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It was found to be easy to use, reliable, and a strong predictor of myocardial preservation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The goal of this study was to evaluate the applicability of this monitor in the measurement of brain pH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifteen New Zealand white rabbits underwent general endotracheal anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A right frontal craniotomy was performed and a pH/temperature glass electrode was inserted in the frontal lobe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both common carotid arteries were exposed in the neck and prepared for occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three rabbits were used as control; their brain pH was recorded over 60 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Twelve rabbits underwent bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> of varying duration and their brain pH measurements were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no significant difference in pH levels at baseline in the two groups (p = 0.604) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were significant differences in pH over time between the control and occlusion group (p = 0.016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The pH dropped steadily and significantly in the occlusion group (p = 0.008), whereas little change in pH was noted over time in the control group (p = 0.366) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The portable Khuri pH monitor has been used by cardiothoracic surgeons to monitor the myocardium during bypass procedures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our experimental pilot study found it to be reliable in measuring the brain pH and to be relatively simple to use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>It is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>We believe it may be of benefit to neurosurgeons </plain></SENT>
