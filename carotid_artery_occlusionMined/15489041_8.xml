<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We assessed whether this is mediated through prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>hyperthermia</z:hpo> that normally follows <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in gerbils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Male gerbils were given sustained-released <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16469">17beta-estradiol</z:chebi> pellets or sham operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Later, a guide cannula was implanted for brain temperature measurement and some were implanted with core temperature telemetry probes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Gerbils were subjected to either 5 min bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> or sham procedures 2 weeks after pellet surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Brain temperature was normothermic during surgery in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In experiment 1, only core temperature was measured afterward in untreated and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi>-treated gerbils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In experiment 2, postischemic core temperature was measured in untreated and two <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi>-treated ischemic groups, one of which had their postischemic temperature increased, via infrared lamp, to mimic the untreated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013170" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">Habituation</z:e> was assessed on days 5 and 6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>Hyperthermia</z:hpo>, like that which occurs spontaneously, was forced on untreated and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi>-treated ischemic animals in the third experiment, where brain temperature was measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CA1 cell counts were assessed after a 7-day survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A fourth experiment measured brain and core temperature simultaneously in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> gerbils during heating with an infrared lamp </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">Estrogen</z:chebi> did not affect core temperature of non-ischemic gerbils whereas spontaneous postischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>hyperthermia</z:hpo> was blocked </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">Estrogen</z:chebi> reduced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and provided behavioral protection when gerbils regulated their own core temperature, but not when core <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>hyperthermia</z:hpo> was enforced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Conversely, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> reduced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in gerbils that had their brain temperature elevated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Experiment 4 showed that the brain becomes overheated (by approximately 1 degree C) when core temperature is elevated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> likely failed to reduce CA1 injury in experiment 2, when core <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>hyperthermia</z:hpo> was enforced, because of overheating the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> reduces CA1 cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> by mechanisms other than preventing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>hyperthermia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Our results also suggest that future studies regulate brain instead of body temperature </plain></SENT>
