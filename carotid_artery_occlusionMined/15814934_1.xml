<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Strategies are being developed and evaluated for their ability to minimize the clinical embolic risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to determine the feasibility, safety, and technical considerations of performing carotid artery stent placement with use of a distal balloon antiembolization system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Carotid artery stent placement with use of a commercially available distal balloon antiembolization system was performed in 303 patients (325 vessels) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical neurologic complications were adjudicated at the time of intervention and at 1 month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Technical success was achieved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one case, with reduction of the mean percentage carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> from 79 +/- 9% to 3 +/- 8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intolerance to internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> occurred in 11 patients (3.6%); in one patient the procedure was aborted, and in 10 the procedures were expeditiously completed with no adverse neurologic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 30-day combined rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> occurrences of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was 2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These events included three (0.9%) <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> emboli, three (0.9%) minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, and one (0.3%) fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> from brain <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of which occurred during the procedure with no events occurring after discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, two (0.6%) <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> and three (0.9%) reperfusion syndromes occurred, with the patients experiencing complete recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Carotid artery stent placement with use of the distal balloon protection system is feasible and safe, and the short-term outcomes appear to be favorable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Optimal application of proper technique is important </plain></SENT>
