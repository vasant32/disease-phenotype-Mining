<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Minor cortical injury has previously been shown to improve survival in animals subjected to ischemic insults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the mechanism by which an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-tolerant state is achieved is not clear, transient neuronal depolarization is thought to play a central role in the development of the tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One way of producing transient neuronal depolarization is by the induction of cortical spreading <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> (CSD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The present study was conducted to evaluate the effect of preischemic transient depolarization, induced by CSD, on postischemic neuronal outcome in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Unilateral CSD was induced by application of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32588">KCl</z:chebi> to the frontal cortex (CSD hemisphere) in three groups of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi>-anesthetized rats (CSD groups; n = 8/group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sham animals (n = 12) did not undergo CSD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a fifth group (n = 8), ketamine was administered during <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32588">KCl</z:chebi> application to inhibit CSD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One, three, or seven days after CSD, animals were subjected to forebrain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> produced by bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Injury to the striatum, hippocampus, and cortex was evaluated in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin-stained brain sections 3 days after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Preischemic CSD reduced postischemic injury in the ipsilateral cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The ratio of the number of injured neurons in the CSD hemisphere to that in the non-CSD hemisphere was significantly less in the groups subjected to CSD 1 day (0.51 +/- 0.33), 3 days (0.56 /- 0.22), and 7 days (0.40 +/- 0.17) before <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> than in the sham operated group (1.11 +/- 0.47) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the ketamine group (CSD inhibition), there were no differences in the extent of injury in the two hemispheres (ratio = 0.84 +/- 0.47) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Injury to the striatum and hippocampus was similar among the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Within each group, injury to these subcortical structures in the CSD hemisphere was not different from that in the non-CSD hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that preischemic depolarization induced by CSD results in an adaptive response that reduces the vulnerability of cortical neurons to subsequent ischemic injury (ischemic tolerance) </plain></SENT>
