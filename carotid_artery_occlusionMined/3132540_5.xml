<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three patients had unilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> with no angiographic evidence of contralateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> or ophthalmic collateral flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eleven of these patients had undergone extracranial-intracranial (EC-IC) bypass surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sixteen age-matched <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> men underwent CBF measurements at normocapnia and <z:mp ids='MP_0002318'>hypercapnia</z:mp> to provide control data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean hemispheric CBF was not different between hemispheres ipsilateral and contralateral to the carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> either in the patients who had undergone bypass surgery or in those with carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Considering <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, mean <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> reactivity was decreased in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the occlusion as compared to the contralateral hemisphere in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Based on data from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals, a hemispheric difference in <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> reactivity of more than 0.94%/mm Hg PaCO2 or a global <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> reactivity of less than 0.66%/mm Hg PaCO2 was considered abnormal for an individual patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Six of 23 patients with carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (three with an EC-IC bypass) had global or hemispheric abnormalities in <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> reactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with impaired <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> reactivity were not distinguishable from other patients by neurological examination, presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo>, or evidence of infarction on computerized tomography scanning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This test was safe and simple to perform and may be a useful means of detecting impaired cerebrovascular collateral reserve capacity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>If impaired <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> reactivity after carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> proves to be associated with a high risk of subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, the test would provide a physiological basis for selecting a subgroup of patients who could be helped by cerebral revascularization </plain></SENT>
