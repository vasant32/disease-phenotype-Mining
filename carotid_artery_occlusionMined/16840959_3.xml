<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To determine changes in cerebral perfusion parameters, based on CT perfusion imaging, in patients after unilateral transluminal angioplasty and stent placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: 74 patients with symptomatic high - grade internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> (&gt;70%) were studied with CT perfusion imaging before and - on average - 70 hours and 172 days after carotid stent placement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were 50 patients with unilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> and 24 with stenosis and accompanying contralateral internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CT examination was performed using a multidetector helical CT scanner (Light Speed Ultra Advantage, GE Healthcare, USA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Maps showing the absolute values of cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume (CBV) and mean transit time (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi>) were generated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In a group with unilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> perfusion deficits were present in 84% of patients, ipsilaterally to stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> elongation was noted (6.2-6.8s) together with decreased values of CBF (40-46ml/100g/min) and slightly increased CBV (3.2ml/100g) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In this group, 3 days after stenting, 30% of patients had perfusion deficits, and after 6 months only 6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In a group with carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> and contralateral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> severe perfusion deficits were noted in both hemispheres and they were present in 100% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>6 months after stenting hypoperfusion was observed only in 17% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Brain perfusion deficits, observed in a majority of patients with carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> tend to improve considerably after carotid artery stenting, in long - term follow up </plain></SENT>
