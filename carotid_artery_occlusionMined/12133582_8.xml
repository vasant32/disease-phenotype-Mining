<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Protein kinase B, also known as Akt/PKB, is part of an endogenous pathway that exerts effective neuroprotection from both necrotic and apoptotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using a rat model of unilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> coupled with <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>, and using in vitro rat hippocampal slices, we examined the ability of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> to directly activate Akt/PKB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Western blot analysis revealed that levels of phosphorylated Akt/PKB were elevated in vivo under ischemic conditions in an <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> A(1)-dependent manner and elevated in hippocampal slices treated with an <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> A(1) <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We conclude from these studies that the activation of an <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> A(1) receptor-mediated signal transduction pathway, either by endogenous <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> (in vivo) or by an <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> A(1) <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> (in vitro), results in the activation of the neurotrophic kinase Akt/PKB </plain></SENT>
