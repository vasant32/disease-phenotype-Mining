<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Adult Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to 20 min common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (CCAo) 24 h after coagulation of both vertebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty minutes after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of CCAo, rats received an iv injection of HU-211 2, 4, or 8 mg/kg in HPCD (n = 12, 18, and 11, respectively), or the appropriate vehicle (n = 20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neurological signs were scored daily for 3 d following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A significant improvement (p &lt; 0.01, Kruskal-Wallis nonparametric test, followed by Mann-Whitney U-test, p &lt; 0.05) of neurological deficits by the 4 mg/kg dose of HU-211, was observed 24, 48, and 72 h after insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the third day post-CCAo, the rat brain was taken for histopathological evaluation of the CA-1 sector of the hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Counts of viable neurons in the hippocampal CA1 field showed significantly more live cells in the HU-211 (4 mg/kg) treated animals (P &lt; 0.001, ANOVA followed by Duncan's post-hoc test, p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The drug was equally effective when given 30 and 60 min after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, but neuroprotection was no longer significant after 3 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We suggest that HU-211 may be a potential treatment for postischemic brain damage in human beings </plain></SENT>
