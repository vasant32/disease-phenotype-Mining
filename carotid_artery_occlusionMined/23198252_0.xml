<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intracranial and extracranial arteriovenous vasculopathy is a complication that makes this disease more complex and difficult to treat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We describe a 23-year-old female, who presented to her local hospital with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000618'>blindness</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001953'>diabetic ketoacidosis</z:hpo>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> requiring intensive care treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>She was found to have lesions in the nasal sinuses, orbit, and frontal base </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The left carotid artery was occluded from its origin in the neck to the supraclinoid segment and left cavernous sinus involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Biopsies obtained by endonasal debridement confirmed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026718" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mucormycosis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition to antimicrobial therapy, she underwent several multidisciplinary approaches to treat <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017925" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">her disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multiple endonasal, and cranial procedures were done including bilateral orbital exenteration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After prolonged treatment on the intensive care unit she made a remarkable recovery to the point where she was communicating verbally and had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> limb movements and later discharged home </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>She remained alive and well for two months, but later succumbed to a recurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017925" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">her disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026718" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mucormycosis</z:e>-induced vasculopathy is a complex problem, which merits aggressive treatment of this invasive disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It is normally regarded as an indicator of grave prognosis </plain></SENT>
