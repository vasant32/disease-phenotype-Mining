<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Transoral carotid ultrasonography (TOCU) has enabled the assessment of the distal portion of the extracranial internal carotid artery (ICA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the ultrasonographic features of ICA occlusion using TOCU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 50 occluded ICAs in 42 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mechanism of ICA occlusion was embolic (group E) in 14 arteries and thrombotic (group T) in the other 36 arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We used a color flow imaging system equipped with special convex array transducers, and placed the probe on the postero-lateral pharyngeal wall to identify the distal extracranial ICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We evaluated intraluminal echodensity (lucent or opaque) and measured the diameter of the ICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Then, we examined the relationship of these early (&lt;1 week after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> (&gt;4 weeks after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>) phase TOCU findings to the mechanism of ICA occlusion and the site of occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the early phase of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, the intraluminal echodensity was more frequently lucent (9/11, 81.8%) in group E than in group T (5/20, 20%, p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phase, echodensity became opaque in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the early phase, the lucent echodensity was more frequently seen in patients with distal occlusion than in those with proximal occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, it may represent blood or fresh <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In patients with unilateral ICA occlusion, the occluded ICA was significantly smaller in diameter than the non-occluded contralateral artery both in the early and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The echodensity and diameter of the extracranial ICA distal portion as found on TOCU can help to identify the mechanism of ICA occlusion </plain></SENT>
