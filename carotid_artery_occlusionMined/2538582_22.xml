<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ten minutes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was induced by common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> combined with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo>, and the animals were allowed variable periods of recovery ranging from 1 day to 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The binding of 3H-AMPA (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-4-isoxazolepropionic acid) to quisqualate receptors, 3H-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31746">kainic acid</z:chebi> (KA) to kainate receptors, and 3H-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">N-methyl-D-aspartate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi>) receptors as determined by quantitative autoradiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One week following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> the CA1 region of the hippocampus displayed a severe (90%) dendrosomatic lesion with preservation of presynaptic terminals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This was associated with a 60% decrease in AMPA binding and a 25% decrease in <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> binding to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 4 weeks postischemia, both AMPA and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> sites were greatly reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although the dentate gyrus granule cells are resistant to an ischemic insult of this magnitude, this region showed marked changes in receptor binding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One week following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, the AMPA and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> binding decreased by approximately 40 and 20%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Following 2 weeks of recovery, the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">NMDA</z:chebi> binding was not significantly different from control level, while the AMPA binding remained depressed up to 4 weeks postischemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The high density of KA binding sites in the inner molecular layer of the dentate gyrus was unaffected by the ischemic insult, despite an extensive degeneration of cells in the hilus of dentate gyrus which projects glutamatergic afferents to this area.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
