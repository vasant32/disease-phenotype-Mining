<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To analyze the roles of RAGE and its decoy receptor, endogenous secretory RAGE (esRAGE), in the global <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, three different mouse cohorts, <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp>, RAGE⁻/⁻, and esRAGE transgenic (Tg) mice were subjected to bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (BCCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RT-PCR and immunohistochemical analysis revealed that expression of RAGE was induced in the vascular cells at 12 h, and then in the neurons and glia from 3 to 7 days in the hippocampus after BCCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The numbers of surviving neurons in the hippocampal CA1 region were significantly higher in RAGE⁻/⁻ and esRAGE Tg mice than those in <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice in the periods between 24 h and 7 days after BCCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lower levels of 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT) and higher levels of endothelial nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (eNOS), together with enlarged vascular areas were observed in RAGE⁻/⁻ and esRAGE Tg mice at 12 h after BCCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the later periods, expressions of glia-derived <z:mp ids='MP_0002501'>inflammatory mediators</z:mp> TNFα and inducible nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (iNOS) were reduced in RAGE⁻/⁻ and esRAGE Tg mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that RAGE may contribute to delayed neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> after global <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> by enhancing vascular injury and deleterious glia-mediated <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
