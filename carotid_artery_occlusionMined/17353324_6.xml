<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between January 1996 and August 2004, 52 patients were treated with carotid artery balloon occlusion for carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In June 2005, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, their next of kin, or family physicians were contacted and questioned concerning episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> or hospital admissions that could be attributed to SAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography (MRA) at 3T were performed in 26 of 44 surviving patients after a mean follow-up period of 50.2 months (median, 43.5 months; range, 14-107 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging and MRA studies were compared with the digital subtraction angiograms at the time of carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During clinical follow-up of 52 patients at a mean of 50.3 months (median, 42.5 months; range, 0-107 months), no episodes of SAH were reported (0%; 97.5% confidence interval [CI], 0-8.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the 26 patients with follow-up <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging, no de novo <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> were detected (0%; 97.5 CI, 0-13.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Five existing untreated small <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> in 5 patients had not enlarged after a mean follow-up of 40 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In this study, therapeutic carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was not associated with development of new <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> or enlargement of existing untreated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> with time </plain></SENT>
