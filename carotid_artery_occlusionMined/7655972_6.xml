<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To study the effect of contralateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> on oxygen saturation (CsO2) of both cerebral hemispheres monitored by reflective near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) during carotid surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: NIRS was compared to ipsilateral transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (TCD) of the middle cerebral artery and jugular bulb venous oxygen saturation (JvSO2) in 54 patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Median operated side and contralateral CsO2 were 68(54-88)% and 69(55-85)% before carotid clamping falling to 63(44-80)% and 69(55-84)% respectively on clamping the carotid (p &lt; 0.0001 and p = NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>JvSO2 fell from 78(38-98)% to 72(30-97)% on carotid clamping with a percentage fall in peak TCD of -28(0 to -100)% (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with a contralateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> experienced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002527'>falls</z:hpo> in ipsi and contralateral CsO2 of -8(-4 to -10)% and -3(2 to -7)% compared to -4(0 to -14)% and 0(-5 to 4)% in those with a lesser stenosis (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On declamping, median ipsilateral and contralateral CsO2 rose from 65(46-82)% and 67(52-87)% to 68(53-84)% respectively (p &lt; 0.0001 and p = NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>JvSO2 increased from 75(33-95)% to 79(42-95)% (p &lt; 0.0001) with an increase in median peak TCD of 35(-34 to 506)% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The greatest changes in CsO2 occurred in the operated side cerebral hemispheres in those with a contralateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, a contralateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> does not reliably predict the need for a shunt and cerebral monitoring remains essential; although is only required on the operated side </plain></SENT>
