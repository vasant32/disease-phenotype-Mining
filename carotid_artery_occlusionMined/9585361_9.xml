<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The goal of this study was to determine whether aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA), an endonuclease inhibitor known to inhibit <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, could ameliorate cell damage in a gerbil model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">transient ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Transient ischemia</z:e> was induced in gerbils by bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> for a period of 5 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four micrograms of ATA was administered intraventricularly 1 hour before <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, and the brains were assessed histologically 1 week later to quantitate cell loss in the vulnerable CA-1 subsector of the hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a separate set of experiments, 4 microg of ATA was administered intraventricularly 1 hour before <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and the brains were assessed for evidence of DNA fragmentation by the TUNEL method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was only a 16% cell loss compared with nonischemic controls in animals pretreated with ATA that was significantly less (p &lt; 0.05) than the 48% cell loss in animals pretreated with saline alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>TUNEL-positive cells were first evident at 3 days and were still present at 7 days subsequent to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Maximal staining occurred at 4 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment with ATA virtually eliminated TUNEL staining at 4 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results support the hypothesis that the delayed cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> secondary to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">transient ischemia</z:e> is, in part, apoptotic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, ATA afforded significant neuronal protection and prevented DNA fragmentation </plain></SENT>
