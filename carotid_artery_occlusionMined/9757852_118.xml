<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>CONTEXT: The relative importance of hemodynamic factors in the pathogenesis and treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in patients with carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> remains controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that stage II cerebral hemodynamic failure (increased oxygen extraction measured by <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography [PET]) distal to symptomatic carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> is an independent risk factor for subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in medically treated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND SETTING: Prospective, blinded, longitudinal cohort study of patients referred from a group of regional hospitals between 1992 and 1996 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: From 419 subjects referred, 81 with previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> in the territory of an occluded carotid artery were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> were followed up to completion of the study, with average follow-up of 31.5 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Telephone contact every 6 months recorded the subsequent occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> occurred in 12 of 39 patients with stage II hemodynamic failure and in 3 of 42 patients without (P = .005); <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was ipsilateral in 11 of 39 patients with stage II hemodynamic failure and in 2 of 42 patients without (P = .004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Six <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occurred in each group (P = .94) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The age-adjusted relative risk conferred by stage II hemodynamic failure was 6.0 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.7-21.6) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and 7.3 (95% CI, 1.6-33.4) for ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Stage II hemodynamic failure defines a subgroup of patients with symptomatic carotid occlusion who are at high risk for subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> when treated medically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A randomized trial evaluating surgical revascularization in this high-risk subgroup is warranted </plain></SENT>
