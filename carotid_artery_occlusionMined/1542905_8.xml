<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The sigma-<z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> are believed to interact with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">N-methyl-D-aspartate</z:chebi> receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we studied the neuroprotective, hypothermic, and motor deficit effects of the sigma-<z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> SKF 10,047 and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">N-methyl-D-aspartate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> MK-801 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Neuroprotective effects were compared using an in vitro <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> model of cultured rat cerebellar granule cells and the gerbil model of global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> induced by 5 minutes of bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> followed by 7 days of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In vitro, (+)MK-801 protected against 100 microM <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> with a 50% protective concentration of 30 nM, followed by (-)MK-801 (150 nM), cyclazocine (0.5 microM), (+)SKF 10,047 (3.3 microM), pentazocine (5 microM), and (-)SKF 10,047 (10 microM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In vivo, (+)SKF 10,047 pretreatment (60 mg/kg) or multiple postischemic treatments provided neuroprotection comparable with MK-801 pretreatment (10 mg/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When ischemic animals were administered the multiple dosing regimen of (+)SKF 10,047, no hypothermic effect was noted in the temporalis muscle over 4 hours' postischemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Motor deficits monitored by a swing grid test showed that 50% recovery from (+)SKF 10,047 was 5.5 times faster than recovery from MK-801 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results are the first to report a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo>-free, in vivo neuroprotective effect of (+)SKF 10,047, a prototypical drug of the sigma-<z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> class </plain></SENT>
