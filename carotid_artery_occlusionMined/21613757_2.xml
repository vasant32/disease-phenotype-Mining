<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ebselen has beneficial effects on the neurological outcome of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, the mechanisms by which ebselen can elicit neuroprotective effects against ischemic brain injury were investigated in male Wistar rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Experimental forebrain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was induced by bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> with hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ebselen was administered to animals in the treatment group 2 hours prior to the induction of forebrain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, and placebo was administered in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow (CBF) was measured by the hydrogen clearance method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cortical extracellular levels of excitatory amino acids (EAAs) and NO were evaluated using in vivo microdialysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neuronal damage in the CA1 subfield of the hippocampus was assessed in brains harvested after a 24-hour period of survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CBF did not recover to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> physiological levels after ischemic insults in either the control or treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The differences in the sequential changes in extracellular EAA and NO levels between groups were not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was a significantly larger mean density of intact, undamaged neurons in the CA1 subfield in the treatment group than in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The neuroprotective effects of ebselen were reflected in the histological findings, without significant inhibition of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> release or NO synthesis during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of experimentally induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
