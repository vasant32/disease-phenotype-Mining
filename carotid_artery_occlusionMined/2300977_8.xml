<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We induced focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in 28 gerbils by occluding the common carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We recorded electrocorticograms in 34 gerbils by positioning bipolar electrodes between the anterior and middle cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We related the electrocorticograms to local cerebral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> utilization measured with [<z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>]2-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15866">deoxyglucose</z:chebi> in half the gerbils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A characteristic pattern (a zone of markedly decreased [<z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>]2-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15866">deoxyglucose</z:chebi> uptake surrounded by a narrow band of greatly increased uptake) was observed on the autoradiogram in nine of the 14 experimental gerbils (64%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An electrocorticogram recorded from such a band of increased uptake was characterized by transient suppression of electrical activity followed by partial or complete recovery, and local cerebral blood flow in gerbils showing this electrocorticographic type were variable (15.0-43.3 ml/100 g/min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An electrocorticogram recorded from the ischemic core and inner border of this band, even when [<z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>]2-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15866">deoxyglucose</z:chebi> uptake was relatively high, was characterized by the complete disappearance of electrical activity just after occlusion; cerebral blood flow in gerbils that showed this electrocorticographic type were consistently less than 15.0 ml/100 g/min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our investigation suggests that the transient disappearance of electrocorticographic activity in the periphery of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, which has relatively high residual blood flow, may relate to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> consumption during the early stage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
