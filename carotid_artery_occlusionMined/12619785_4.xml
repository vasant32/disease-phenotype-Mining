<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Several animal models of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> have been developed to investigate both pathophysiology and pharmacological treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to verify the prognostic value of EEG power spectra analysis in a two-vessel plus <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> rat model of transient global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) and Wistar Kyoto rats (WKYs) were subjected to 20 min bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> plus <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29321">sodium nitroprusside</z:chebi> followed by reperfusion for seven days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sham-operated animals served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The changes after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in EEG power spectra, and their relations with neuronal damage and astrocytic response were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The EEG analysis revealed that in SHRs and WKYs, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> produced a dramatic increase in delta activity and a decrease in theta, beta and alpha activities derived from both cortical and hippocampal areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>EEG activity reverted to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values more quickly in WKYs than in SHRs which did not recover cortical and hippocampal alpha and beta activities even at six days of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SHRs presented more severe damage and intense <z:hpo ids='HP_0002446'>astrocytosis</z:hpo> than WKYs in almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the brain regions analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In SHRs, hippocampal delta activity was positively correlated with the degree of neuronal <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> and astrocytic activation, whereas theta, alpha and beta activities correlated negatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No correlations were found in WKYs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that the hippocampal bioelectrical activity recorded in SHRs from the beginning of reperfusion could be useful for predicting the ischemic outcome and evaluating the effects of pharmacological interventions </plain></SENT>
