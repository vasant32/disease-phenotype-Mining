<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent studies suggest that the cerebral hematocrit decreases with diminished cerebral perfusion pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To investigate whether the effect of carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> on the hematocrit in the centrum semiovale is different from that in the cerebral cortex, seven patients with unilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> were studied with <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The distributions of the red blood cell and plasma volumes were assessed using <z:chebi fb="168" ids="17245">carbon monoxide</z:chebi> labeled with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36932">oxygen 15</z:chebi> and human serum albumin-dithiosemicarbazone tracers labeled with copper 62, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The CBF and CMRO2 were also measured with the (15)O steady-state technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The calculated values for the hematocrit in the centrum semiovale ipsilateral to the <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arterial occlusion</z:mp> were significantly decreased compared with those in any of the other regions examined (the overlying cortical region and the contralateral cortex and centrum semiovale) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This decrease in hematocrit, which resulted from a more pronounced increase in plasma volume than in red blood cell volume, was associated with a decrease in CBF and an increase in the oxygen extraction fraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Hemodynamic disturbance caused by carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> may induce selective decrease of hematocrit limited to the centrum semiovale </plain></SENT>
