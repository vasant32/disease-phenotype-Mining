<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we asked whether keratinocyte growth factor (KGF), one of the FGF superfamily, would express in the brain, and have neuroprotective against ischemic brain injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In situ hybridization analysis revealed that intense silver grains for KGF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> are observed in the neuronal cells of the cerebral cortex, hippocampus and amygdala in gerbil brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Continuous cerebroventricular infusion of KGF (20 microg) for a 7 day period to gerbils starting 2 days before temporary right carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (20 min) resulted in a higher survival rate than seen in vehicle-treated ischemic animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subsequent histological examinations showed that KGF effectively prevented delayed neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of the hippocampal CA1 region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In situ detection of DNA fragmentation (TUNEL staining) revealed that ischemic animals infused with KGF contained fewer TUNEL-positive neurons in the hippocampal CA1 field than those infused with vehicle alone at the forth and seventh day after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>KGF-treated brain showed over-expression of KGF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in the neuronal cells of the cerebral cortex, hippocampus only in the right hemisphere, which was the side of carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, 8-10 h after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that KGF has a protective effect against ischemic hippocampal neuronal damage in vivo, which may provide a new therapeutic strategy in the survival and reconstruction of neurons in response to cerebral injury </plain></SENT>
