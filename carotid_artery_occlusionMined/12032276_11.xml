<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fetal sheep were exposed to 30 min of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> followed by 48 (I/R-48, n = 8) or 72 (I/R-72, n = 10) h of reperfusion or control sham treatment (control, n = 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serial coronal sections stained with Luxol fast blue/<z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi> and eosin were scored for white matter, cerebral cortical, and hippocampal lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> areas received graded pathologic scores of 0 to 5, reflecting the degree of injury where 0 = 0%, 1 = 1% to 25%, 2 = 26% to 50%, 3 = 51% to 75%, 4 = 76% to 95%, and 5 = 96% to 100% of the area damaged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Dual-label immunofluorescence using antibodies against glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and myelin basic protein (MBP) were used to characterize white matter lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2) was measured in the frontal cortex by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results of the pathologic scores showed that the white matter of the I/R-72 (2.74 +/- 0.53, mean +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) was more (p &lt; 0.05) damaged when compared with the control (0.80 +/- 0.33) group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cortical lesions were greater (p &lt; 0.05) in the I/R-48 (2.12 +/- 0.35) than the control (0.93 +/- 0.09) group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>White matter lesions were characterized by reactive GFAP-positive astrocytes and a loss of MBP in oligodendrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The ratio of MBP to GFAP decreased (p &lt; 0.05) as a function of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, indicative of a proportionally greater loss of MBP than GFAP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>FGF-2 concentrations were higher (p &lt; 0.05) in the I/R-72 than the control group and there was a direct correlation between the pathologic scores (PS) and FGF-2 concentrations (FGF-2 = e((1.6 PS-0.90)) + 743, n = 17, r = 0.73, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We conclude that carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> results in quantifiable white matter lesions that are associated with a loss of MBP from myelin, and that FGF-2, a purported mediator of recovery from brain injury in adult subjects, increases in concentration in proportion to the severity of brain damage in the fetus </plain></SENT>
