<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A priority approach to the extracranial vessels was followed </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An external carotid angioplasty or bypass was given priority if its origin was stenotic or occluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>If both vertebral arteries, or the dominant one, had stenoses at their origin greater than 75% of the cross-sectional area, a subclavian-vertebral artery bypass was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When both internal carotid arteries are occluded, the external carotid and vertebrovasilar systems are the main collaterals and are often also stenotic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Correction of these occlusive lesions in the collateral pathways produced complete symptomatic relief in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In two selected cases with specific angiographic findings and a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> blood pressure, immediate internal carotid thromboendarterectomy was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No morbidity or mortality was encountered in these seven patients </plain></SENT>
