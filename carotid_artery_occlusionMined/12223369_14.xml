<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether LIF is more effective than conservative methods in the treatment of CRAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In this retrospective study, a total of 178 patients (125 men and 53 women) with CRAO were treated at the Eye Hospital of the University of Freiburg from 1980 to 2000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The average age of the patients was 66.8 years (SD, 12 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In group I, 116 patients were treated conservatively by anterior chamber paracentesis, massage of the globe, isovolemic hemodilution, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi>, Pentoxifyllin, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15365">acetylsalicylic acid</z:chebi>, and reduction of arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Some combination but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the mentioned conservative methods were used in the conservatively treated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In group II, 62 patients receiving LIF received local injection of urokinase or recombinant tissue plasminogen activator into the proximal part of the ophthalmic artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In case of ipsilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> or high grade stenosis (14 of 62 patients), the thrombolytic agent was administered into the internal maxillary artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 178 patients, the CRAO was subtotal in 130 (73.0%), incomplete in 39 (21.9%), and total in nine (5.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Statistical calculations showed a significantly better visual acuity in group II patients, who were treated with LIF, in comparison with group I patients, who were treated conservatively (P =.0022) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: For patients with CRAO, LIF is superior to conservative treatment </plain></SENT>
