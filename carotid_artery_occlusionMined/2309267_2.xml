<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied eight anesthetized and physiologically monitored adult baboons (Papio cyanocephalus); four were subjected to hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> alone and four to hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> plus unilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow was measured using <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi>-133, the electroencephalogram was recorded using silver-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30341">silver chloride</z:chebi> epidural electrodes, and histologic examination was carried out after perfusion-fixation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the baboons subjected to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> alone (mean arterial blood pressure of 28 mm Hg) cerebral blood flow was 28.5 +/- 5.0 ml/100 g/min, whereas in the baboons subjected to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> plus unilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> it was 21.8 +/- 1.8 ml/100 g/min at a mean arterial blood pressure of 27 mm Hg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was no ischemic damage in the former group, but in the latter group there was <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> in the arterial boundary zones of three baboons and in the distribution of the middle cerebral artery in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We conclude that, when combined with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo>, unilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> may lead to hemodynamic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> accentuated in the arterial boundary zones of the ipsilateral cerebral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
