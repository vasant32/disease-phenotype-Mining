<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We prospectively evaluated the safety and efficacy of 76 carotid artery stenting (CAS) procedures in a consecutive series of 70 Chinese patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This series represented a high-risk group that included patients with unstable <z:mp ids='MP_0006112'>angina</z:mp>, previous ipsilateral CEA, contralateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, post-radiation carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> and other severe co-morbid conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients had independent neurological examinations before and after the procedure and follow-up cerebral angiography at 6 month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The procedural success rate was 100% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> was (82+/-18) % before and (5+/-10) % after the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During the initial hospital period and 30 days after CAS, there was no major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> but 3 minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> (5.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarctions</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occurred during or within 30 days following CAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At a mean follow-up of 20+/-12 months, 2 patients (2.8%) had asymptomatic restenosis, and 2 non-Q wave <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>Death</z:hpo> occurred in 2 cases, but none of them was attributed to a neurological cause </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Three patients had minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> and no major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> occurred during the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Percutaneous carotid artery stenting is feasible for performance in Chinese patients and may lower the restenosis rate </plain></SENT>
