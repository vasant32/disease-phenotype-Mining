<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Computed tomo-graphy (CT) showed hyperdense right middle cerebral arte-ry (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On transcranial Doppler (TCD), occlusion of the right <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> and right internal carotid artery (ICA) was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty minutes after thrombolytic therapy was initiat-ed, engagement of collateral circulation through the anterior communicating artery (AComA) was shown by TCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Caro-tid duplex examination confirmed occlusion of the right ICA with intimal flap and intramural haematoma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CT angiography revealed flame-like occlusion of the right ICA, and occlusion of the right <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> with collateral supply from the left to right anterior cerebral artery through the AComA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Recanali-zation of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> and ICA was evident on both CT and ultrasound </plain></SENT>
