<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was induced by bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The hemisphere with the hypoplastic posterior communicating artery was determined and then the hippocampus in this hemisphere was evaluated qualitatively using a score of 0 to 4 and quantitatively using an image analyzer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Hippocampal injury was reduced in Tg mice after both 5 and 10 minutes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the 5-minute <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> group, the mean score of the injury was significantly lower in Tg than nontransgenic (nTg) mice at 3 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the 10-minute group, the hippocampal injury was reduced more in Tg than nTg mice at 1 day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Quantitative evaluation by an image analyzer confirmed the qualitative data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neurons with fragmented DNA were also studied in the hippocampal injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the 5-minute group, despite the reduction of the injury in Tg mice, their neurons with fragmented DNA were relatively increased at 1 day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the 10-minute group, this ratio was almost the same in both nTg and Tg mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CuZn-SOD plays a protective role in the pathogenesis of selective hippocampal injury after brief <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, whether the insult is relatively mild or intense </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, CuZn-SOD may reduce both necrotic and DNA fragmented neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> after global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
