<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our suggestion was that 10% <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi> solution infusion could dilate pial arterioles through nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> release and/or stimulation of ATP-sensitive <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> (K(ATP)) channels </plain></SENT>
