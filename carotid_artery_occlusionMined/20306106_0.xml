<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We present the first study in the literature that focuses on urgent open embolectomy for the treatment of cardioembolic cervical ICA occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A retrospective review of the charts for patients undergoing open embolectomy was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Between April 2006 and September 2007, 640 consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> were treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of them, three patients (0.47%) with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> complete cardioembolic cervical ICA occlusion underwent urgent open embolectomy </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> emboli in three patients were very large and fibrinous in histological findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two of three patients showed rapid improvement in neurological functions after surgical treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The cardioembolic occlusion of the cervical ICA is rare, but its possibility should be considered in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> suffering profound neurological deficits and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Urgent open embolectomy may be a treatment option to obtain successful recanalization for cardioembolic cervical ICA occlusion and is recommended because it is technically easier and similar to carotid endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
