<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038663" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">attempted suicide</z:e> by hanging, a combination of mechanisms causing local destruction of the pharynx, larynx, vessels, and spine, as well as neurologic complications, has to be considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present a case of hanging in which a deeply unconscious patient without any palpaple pulsation of the carotid arteries was referred to our otolaryngology department </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography and angiography showed parapharyngeal air, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">complete obstruction</z:e> of both common carotid arteries, and a compensatory circulation through the vertebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three hours after the trauma, surgical exploration with resection of the enrolled intima of both carotid arteries and repair of the pharynx was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient awoke with an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> of the right hemisphere with incomplete left <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> the next day, but symptoms slowly declined during the following months, and the patient learned swallowing again perfectly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude from our experience that in near-hanged patients a prompt <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of adequate diagnostic and therapeutic measures is mandatory, as good neurologic and functional results may occur even in cases with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> and severe destruction of the carotid arteries and pharyngeal and laryngeal structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Surgical repair of blunt carotid lesions is recommended and may be crucial for a good outcome </plain></SENT>
