<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated the changes of behavioral, electrophysiological and biochemical parameters during and after global <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Global <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was produced by the temporary occlusion of both common carotid arteries 24 hr after the permanent electrocauterization of bilateral vertebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Just before recirculation following 10 or 30 min of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, loss of righting reflex, flattenning of cortical EEG activity, and detrimental decrease of ATP content and marked increase of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> content in the cerebrum were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The alterations of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> parameters completely recovered within 60 min after recirculation in 10-min cerebral ischemic rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the 30-min cerebral ischemic rats showed almost no recovery after recirculation, suggesting that some irreversible damages are produced in the cerebrum of the 30-min ischemic rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, it was found that the auditory brain stem evoked response (ABER) and ATP content in the pons plus medulla were only slightly affected by the ischemic procedure, which indicates that the ischemic damages do not ensue in the lower part of the brain stem </plain></SENT>
