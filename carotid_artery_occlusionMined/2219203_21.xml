<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These studies allowed quantification of the regional hemodynamic status, especially in relation to watershed areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Compared with eight <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls, the patients had significantly (p less than 0.01) decreased regional cerebral blood flow in the middle cerebral artery territory and the surrounding watershed areas of the occluded hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The oxygen extraction fraction rose with the distance from the anterior portion of the circle of Willis, attaining the highest value in the superior parietal and posterior temporo-occipital watershed area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A concomitant decrease in the cerebral blood flow/cerebral blood volume ratio suggested reduction in the mean blood flow velocity, whereby elevated blood viscosity would be more liable to reduce cerebral blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest hemodynamic vulnerability of the watershed areas after internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in persons with good collateral circulation through the anterior portion of the circle of Willis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results also emphasize the importance of systemic hemodynamic factors such as blood pressure and circulating blood volume in the genesis of watershed infarction </plain></SENT>
