<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>[3H]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="42471">Forskolin</z:chebi> (FK) and [3H]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17598">phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17598">PDBu</z:chebi>) were used as specific ligands for adenylate cyclase (AC) and protein kinase C (PKC) activity estimation, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CBF was determined at the end of the experiment by the [<z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>]iodoantipyrine method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A quantitative autoradiographic method permitted simultaneous measurement of the three parameters in the same brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The levels in the caudate-putamen, globus pallidus, and hippocampus were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The animals were divided into three groups: Group 1 with severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (CBF in the lateral nuclei of the thalamus (CBFt) less than 50 ml/100 g/min), Group 2 with mild <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (CBFt greater than or equal to 50 ml/100 g/min), and the Sham Group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17598">PDBu</z:chebi> binding revealed a statistically significant increase in the caudate-putamen, lateral nuclei of the thalamus and hippocampus (CA1 and CA3 regions and dentate gyrus) on the ischemic side in Group 1 as compared to that in Group 2 and the Sham Group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the FK binding did not show any significant changes in any of the regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data and our previous findings for 6-h <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> suggest that (1) PKC translocation to the cell membrane may occur at the early ischemic phase in particular regions including the caudate-putamen, lateral nuclei of the thalamus and hippocampus, with the translocated PKC gradually diminishing during the subsequent ischemic period; and (2) the suppression of the AC system observed in 6-h <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> may not appear in the early ischemic phase </plain></SENT>
