<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that during <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo>, in addition to physiological autoregulation, further arteriolar relaxation is possible by pharmacological means </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We tested the feasibility of using intracarotid <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi>, a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="38215">calcium channel blocker</z:chebi>, to decrease the cerebrovascular resistance (CVR) and augment cerebral blood flow (CBF) at low postocclusion distal ICA pressures (PICA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients undergoing trial occlusion of ICA were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Distal ICA or stump pressure, hemispheric CBF, and CVR were determined before and after carotid occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During ICA occlusion, CBF and other physiological variables were determined before and after intracarotid <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two patients were excluded from the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Carotid occlusion (n = 9) significantly decreased PICA (mean +/- SD, from 82 +/- 22 to 46 +/- 11 mm Hg, P = 0.001) and CBF (from 42 +/- 11 to 33 +/- 11 mL.100 g-1.min-1, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During occlusion, after intracarotid <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> (3.9 +/- 1.6 mg), hemispheric CBF tended to increase from 31 +/- 11 to 35 +/- 14 mL.100 g-1.min-1 (P = 0.067) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, the percent increase in CBF after <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> was a linear function of PICA (y = 1.01 x -32, n = 9, r2 = 0.84, P = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The decrease in CBF during carotid occlusion suggests that near maximal cerebral autoregulatory vasodilation had occurred, although our results indicate that it may be feasible to further augment CBF by pharmacological means during <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Implications: When the internal carotid artery is occluded during neurosurgical procedures, there may be a significant reduction in cerebral perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The authors have demonstrated that the intraarterial administration of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> increases cerebral blood flow as a linear function of cerebral artery pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Intracarotid injection of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35620">vasodilators</z:chebi> may augment cerebral blood flow during <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cerebral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
