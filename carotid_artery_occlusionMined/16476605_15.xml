<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to evaluate our single institution experience with octogenarians and whether they have an increased incidence of major complications with carotid artery stenting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Three hundred eighty-six patients, including 260 patients from 10 regulatory trials, who underwent carotid artery stenting between June 1996 and March 2004 for symptomatic or asymptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> were reviewed from a prospectively maintained database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Periprocedural (&lt; or =30 days after carotid artery stenting) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>cerebrovascular accident</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> outcomes were compared between 87 octogenarians and 295 nonoctogenarians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Univariate and multivariate analysis was performed for confounding factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier analysis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> outcomes was performed for a 1-year follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> adverse outcomes were significantly higher in octogenarians compared with younger patients: 30-day <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate, 8.0% vs 2.7% (P = .02); 30-day <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, 9.2% vs 3.4% (P = .02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cohorts were similar in terms of gender, comorbidities, antiplatelet medications, symptomatic status, and use of cerebral protection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Octogenarians had a greater incidence of contralateral internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (26% vs 12%, P = .001), <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> (21% vs 8%, P = .001), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> (28% vs 15%, P = .007), but a lower incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo> (53% vs 72%, P = .001) and active smoking (8% vs 24%, P = .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis of 30-day major adverse outcomes demonstrated an association between age &gt; or =80 and adverse outcome (odds ratio, 2.85; P = .043) as well as a protective effect of the preprocedural use of aspirin (odds ratio, 0.30, P = .027) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At 1-year follow-up, only 75% of octogenarians and 87% of nonoctogenarians were free from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (P = 005, Kaplan-Meier analysis) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Octogenarians undergoing carotid artery stenting are at higher risk than nonoctogenarians for periprocedural complications, including neurologic events and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Major event-free survival at 1 year is also significantly better in nonoctogenarians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These risks should be weighed when considering carotid stenting in elderly patients </plain></SENT>
