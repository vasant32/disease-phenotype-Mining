<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we studied the neuroprotective effect of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-transfected neural stem cells (NSCs) in newborn rats with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100021'>cerebral palsy</z:hpo> (CP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seven-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups: sham operation (control group), PBS transplantation (PBS group), VEGF+NSCs transplantation (transgene NSCs group) and NSCs transplantation groups (NSCs group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PBS, Transgene NSCs and NSCs groups respectively received stereotactic injections of PBS, lentiviral vector (pGC-FU-VEGF) infected NSCs or a NSCs suspension in the left sensory-motor cortex 3 days after CP model was established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The NSCs activity, their impacts on neural cell growth and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, brain development and animal behaviors were examined on the animals up to age 35-days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As expected, unilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> plus <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0100021'>cerebral palsy</z:hpo> model) resulted in severe neural <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0008073" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">developmental disorders</z:e>, including slowed growth, increased in cortical neuron <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, decreased cerebral cortex micro-vessel density and retarded behavior developments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Transplantation of NSCs not only resulted in increases in VEGF protein expression in rat brains, but also largely prevented the behavioral defects and brain tissue pathology that resulted from <z:hpo ids='HP_0100021'>cerebral palsy</z:hpo> procedure, with animals received VEGF transfected NSCs always being marginally better than these received un-transfected cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, NSCs transplantation can partially prevent/slow down the brain damages that are associated with CP in the newborn rats, suggesting a new possible strategy for CP treatment </plain></SENT>
