<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rats were randomly assigned to anesthesia groups: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="102166">thiopental</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> (PT; 100 mg/kg ip), alpha-chloralose (CH; 100 mg/kg iv), ketamine <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi> plus <z:chebi fb="1" ids="44932">acepromazine</z:chebi> (KA; 135 mg/kg and 1.5 mg/kg sc), and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7983">pentobarbital</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> (PB; 50 mg/kg ip) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PT and PB animals had similar baseline heart rates (HR; 333 and 345 beats/min, respectively) and arterial pressures (MAP; 126 and 118 mmHg, respectively), whereas both were lower in CH and KA (314 and 288 beats/min, 92 and 85 mmHg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During bilateral carotid occlusion, PT demonstrated the largest change in MAP (dMAP; +27 mmHg) but the smallest change in HR (dHR; +8 beats/min) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CH and PB demonstrated similar dHR (+24 and +16 beats/min) and dMAP (+20 and +19 mmHg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>KA demonstrated a significant dHR (+14 beats/min), but the average dMAP was not statistically significant (+3 mmHg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, carotid occlusion in rats anesthetized with PT, PB, or CH consistently elicits a systemic arterial pressor response comparable with that reported for conscious animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When the magnitude and stability of baseline HR and MAP are also considered, PT and PB anesthetization seem to be the most reliable for evaluation of the carotid occlusion pressor response in rats </plain></SENT>
