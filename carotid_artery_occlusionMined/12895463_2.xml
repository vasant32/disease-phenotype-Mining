<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="5" ids="17967">Urethane</z:chebi>-anesthetized rats were given a unilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and then placed in a stereotaxic apparatus for stimulation and recording of bilateral hippocampal field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Arterial blood gases, mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), and bilateral hippocampal blood flow (HBF) were also measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Arterial P(<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi>), HBF, and oxygen delivery were manipulated using normoxic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo>, hypoxic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo>, and hypoxic normotension </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both hypoxic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> and normoxic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> resulted in decreased HBF, decreased oxygen delivery, and a <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> of the evoked fEPSP limited to the hippocampus ipsilateral to the occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The enhanced HBF and oxygen delivery associated with increased MAP resulted in a restoration and maintenance of hippocampal fEPSPs despite sustained hypoxemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> A(1) receptor-mediated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> of the fEPSP was more strongly correlated with changes in HBF and oxygen delivery than with arterial P(<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We propose that <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> plays an important role mediating the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> of neuronal activity associated with reduced oxygen delivery characteristically observed in ischemic brain tissue </plain></SENT>
