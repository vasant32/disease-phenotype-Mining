<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The best treatment approach to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in this setting is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine clinical outcomes in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> attributable to ICA occlusion treated with intravenous (IV) systemic thrombolysis or intra-arterial endovascular therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using the PubMed database, we searched for studies that included patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> attributable to ICA occlusion who received treatment with IV thrombolysis or intra-arterial endovascular interventions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Studies providing data on functional outcomes beyond 30 days and mortality and symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> (sICH) rates were included in our analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We compared the proportions of patients with favorable functional outcomes, sICH, and mortality rates in the 2 treatment groups by calculating Ï‡(2) and confidence intervals for odds ratios </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified 28 studies with 385 patients in the IV thrombolysis group and 584 in the endovascular group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Rates of favorable outcomes and sICH were significantly higher in the endovascular group than the IV thrombolysis-only group (33.6% vs 24.9%, P=0.004 and 11.1% vs 4.9%, P=0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No significant difference in mortality rate was found between the groups (27.3% in the IV thrombolysis group vs 32.0% in the endovascular group; P=0.12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: According to our systematic review, endovascular treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> ICA occlusion results in improved clinical outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A higher rate of sICH after endovascular treatment does not result in increased overall mortality rate </plain></SENT>
