<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To distinguish between <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> complete unilateral cardioembolic and atherothrombotic internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion by using duplex carotid sonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied 11 patients with cardioembolic ICA occlusion (CE group), 32 patients with atherothrombotic ICA occlusion (AT group), and 25 patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> angiographic findings (control group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We obtained B-mode scans and measured the end-diastolic flow velocity (EDV) in both common carotid arteries within 3 days of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Side-to-side ratios of EDV (ED ratio) were calculated by dividing the flow velocity on the unaffected side by that on the affected side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the AT group, the proximal ICA was full, with a large area of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> and partially calcified plaque, and the EDV (10.9 +/- 6.1 cm/s) was significantly lower than that in the control group (20.3 +/- 6.0 cm/s) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The ED ratio was greater than 1.4 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In three patients in the CE group, B-mode scans showed a mobile, echogenic intravascular structure in the proximal ICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The EDV (1.8 +/- 3.4 cm/s) was significantly lower than that in the control and AT groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The ED ratio was greater than 1.4 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We conclude that B-mode scans and the EDV in the common carotid artery can help to distinguish between <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> cardioembolic and atherothrombotic ICA occlusion </plain></SENT>
