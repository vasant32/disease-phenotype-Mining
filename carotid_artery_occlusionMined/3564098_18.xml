<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At the end of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and at various recirculation times ranging from 15 to 120 minutes, brains were frozen in situ and the regional distribution of ATP, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, and tissue pH was studied on coronal cryostat sections by bioluminescent and fluoroscopic techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> ATP was completely depleted, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> decreased to less than 10% of control, and regional tissue pH decreased from 7.04-7.09 to about 6.0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After the beginning of recirculation tissue pH and the regional content of metabolites exhibited a triphasic course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 15 minutes pH returned to or even above <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, and ATP- and <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-induced bioluminescence normalized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, there was a secondary deterioration of both tissue <z:hpo ids='HP_0001941'>acidosis</z:hpo> and the metabolic state after 30 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After longer recirculation times changes again improved and returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> within 2 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These changes were similar in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> brain regions with the exception of the CA1 sector of the hippocampus, where the transient normalization of tissue pH was absent after 15 minutes of recirculation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This finding is in line with the previously observed microcirculatory insufficiency of this area and demonstrates that the CA1 sector of the hippocampus suffers more pronounced postischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001941'>acidosis</z:hpo> than other less vulnerable regions of the brain </plain></SENT>
