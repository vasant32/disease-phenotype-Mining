<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study aims to establish a mouse global <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> model in which the physiological parameter measurements and neuronal injury evaluations are conducted in the same group of animals and to identify the effect of post-ischemic core temperature (CT) on the outcome of neuronal injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was induced by 12-min bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> followed by 7 days of reperfusion in C57BL/6 mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immediately after occlusion, mice were randomly assigned to be kept in environments of different temperatures [25 degrees C (room temperature, group 1), 33-34 degrees C for 2h (group 2), and 33-34 degrees C for 24h (group 3)] before being returned to their home cages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that in group 1, CT declined to approximately 32 degrees C after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and then recovered at 24h post-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>; in group 2, CT remained at the pre-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> level during the first 2h, declined after the mice were returned to room temperature, and recovered at 24h post-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>; and in group 3, CT remained constant at the pre-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> level throughout the reperfusion period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The number of surviving neurons in a sector of the hippocampal CA1 region was significantly lower in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> ischemic groups than in the sham controls, but the number was significantly higher in group 1 than that in groups 2 or 3 (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We observed that CT declines initially but recovers spontaneously at 24h post-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Early post-ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> impacts the delayed neuronal injury, suggesting that tight temperature control immediately following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> is important to obtain the most reproducible neuronal damage in mouse models of cerebral global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
