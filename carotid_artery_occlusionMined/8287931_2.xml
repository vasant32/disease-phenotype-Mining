<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To induce early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (BCAO) was surgically performed on 21 cats at the second week of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>BCAO produces histopathological damage, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo> and thinning of white matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="37971">31P</z:chebi> magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to monitor brain oxidative metabolism, neuronal membrane growth, and myelination of the prefrontal cortex in the first 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neurological development was monitored by conducting 25 tests of reflex, motor, sensory, and integrated behavioral function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 1 month, phosphodiester (PDE) levels, a component of membranes and myelin, were low in animals showing complete ligation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At 2 months, the growth of PDE was low (1/4 to 1/2 of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>) in BCAO animals, whereas <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> animals demonstrated a 23% increase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Phosphocreatine (PCr) levels, indicated by PCr/ATP and PCr/inorganic phosphate ratios, were retarded at 2 months in completely ligated animals (1/4 of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neurologically, the completely ligated animals showed retardation of general development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The retardation was most pronounced for integrative functions, including visual function, and became more pronounced later in development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The time course of emergence of the retardation generally coincided with emergence of abnormalities in phosphorous compounds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The simultaneous occurrence of several biochemical and functional abnormalities in development following early ischemic insult suggests a causal relationship between membrane and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> development and neurological function </plain></SENT>
