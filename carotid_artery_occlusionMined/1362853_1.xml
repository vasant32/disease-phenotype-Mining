<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In <z:chebi fb="5" ids="17967">urethane</z:chebi>-anaesthetized rats the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37890">alpha-adrenoceptor antagonists</z:chebi> and desensitization of P2-purinoceptors with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35056">alpha,beta-methylene ATP</z:chebi> on the pressor reflex responses were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Pressor responses were elicited by electrical stimulation of the central end of the sciatic nerve, by asphyxia and by occlusion of the common carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Responses to sciatic nerve stimulation and to asphyxia, but not those to carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> were entirely suppressed by dihydroergotamine and phentolamine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Under the action of dihydroergotamine the sinocarotid reflex decreased by over 70% in 40% of the experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 60% of experiments the response was only slightly reduced or even augmented, but it was entirely inhibited by subsequent desensitization with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35056">alpha,beta-methylene ATP</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The magnitude of response to sciatic nerve stimulation was almost unaffected by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35056">alpha,beta-methylene ATP</z:chebi>, while the response to carotid occlusion was decreased by 40-50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The recovery of purinoceptor sensitivity to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35056">alpha,beta-methylene ATP</z:chebi> was accompanied by restoration of the sinocarotid reflex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that purinergic neurotransmission plays a considerable role in the pressor sinocarotid reflex, while in the pressor response to stimulation of somatic afferents its role is negligible </plain></SENT>
