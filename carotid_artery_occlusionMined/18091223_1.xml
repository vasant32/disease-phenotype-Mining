<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 53-year-old woman presented with a left internal carotid artery cavernous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> manifesting as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000651'>double vision</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery bypass, internal trapping of the internal carotid artery, and embolization were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three years later, angiography disclosed a distal middle <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral artery aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A 70-year-old man who had undergone right superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery bypass after internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> died of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> from a ruptured anterior spinal artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> 21 years later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Angiography and postmortem examination revealed de novo <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> formation on a middle cerebral artery branch adjoining the anastomotic site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and multiplicity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION: Both cases were de novo true <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> caused by hemodynamic stress because of saccular to fusiform shape, location extending to the middle cerebral artery, high perfusion pressure, projection along the hemodynamic stress, and presence of common risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Bypass surgery is increasingly performed in patients with complicated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> if sacrifice or temporary occlusion of any major vessel is required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, de novo <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> formation may not be rare in patients with risk factors such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> or multiple <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Extended follow-up examination is required in such patients </plain></SENT>
