<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The question remains as to whether the energy failure causes or accentuates the ultimate brain damage or is a consequence of cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To resolve the issue, 7-day postnatal rats underwent unilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> followed thereafter by systemic <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> with 8% oxygen for 2.5 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During recovery, the brains were quick frozen and individually processed for histology and the measurements of 1) high-energy phosphate reserves and 2) neuronal (MAP-2, SNAP-25) and glial (GFAP) proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Phosphocreatine (PCr) and ATP, initially depleted during <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, were partially restored during the first 18 hours of recovery, with secondary <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletions</z:mpath> at 24 and 48 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During the initial recovery phase (6 to 18 hours), there was a significant correlation between PCr and the histology score (0 to 3), but not for ATP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During the late recovery phase, there was a highly significant correlation between <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> measured metabolites and the damage score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Significant correlation also exhibited between the neuronal protein markers, MAP-2 and SNAP-25, and PCr as well as the sum of PCr and Cr at both phases of recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No correlation existed between the high-energy reserves and the glial protein marker, GFAP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The close correspondence of PCr to histologic brain damage and the loss of MAP-2 and SNAP-25 during both the early and late recovery intervals suggest evolving cellular destruction as the primary event, which precedes and leads to the secondary energy failure </plain></SENT>
