<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested two hypotheses: 1) blood flow will be autoregulated throughout arteriolar networks during a pressor response, and 2) wall shear rate (WSR; proportional to VRBC/diameter) will increase during autoregulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Male hamsters (109 +/- 3 g; n = 22) were anesthetized (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="7983">pentobarbital</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> 60 mg/kg), and the cremaster muscle was prepared for intravital videomicroscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Internal diameter and VRBC were monitored in first (1A)- through fourth (4A)-order arterioles; WSR and blood flow were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Data were acquired at rest and at the peak of diameter responses to bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (CAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At rest, 1) mean arterial and 1A transmural pressures were 100 +/- 5 and 59 +/- 4 mmHg, respectively; 2) as branch order increased, arteriolar diameter, VRBC, and blood flow decreased (P &lt; 0.05); and 3) WSR and resting tone increased with branch order (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During pressor responses to CAO, 1) arterial and 1A pressures increased to 145 +/- 7 and 89 +/- 5 mmHg, respectively (P &lt; 0.05); 2) 1A branches dilated while 2A, 3A, and 4A branches constricted (P &lt; 0.05); 3) VRBC and WSR increased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> branches (P&lt;0.05); and 4) blood flow increased in 1A and 2A branches (P &lt; 0.05), yet was unchanged (i.e., was autoregulated) in 3A and 4A branches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Arteriolar constrictions during CAO were not affected by alpha-adrenoceptor blockade with phentolamine (10(-6) M) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that autoregulation of muscle blood flow during a pressor response involves myogenic constriction of arterioles with concomitant elevation of WSR </plain></SENT>
