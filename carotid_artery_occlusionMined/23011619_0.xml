<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To determine the incidence of antegrade internal carotid artery collateral flow in patients with common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, which artery supplies blood to the internal carotid artery, and whether the flow affects regional cerebral blood flow in the middle cerebral artery territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We determined the incidence of antegrade internal carotid artery collateral flow and identified its arterial origins using carotid sonography in 10 patients with common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and evaluated middle cerebral artery territory regional cerebral blood flow by single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography in these patients and 30 age- and sex-matched patients with internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Six (60%) of the 10 patients with common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> had antegrade internal carotid artery collateral flow, which was supplied through the carotid bifurcation from retrograde flow of the external carotid artery in 5 and by a small artery directly into the internal carotid artery in 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The regional cerebral blood flow ipsilateral to the occlusion at rest was higher in patients with common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> than those with internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (mean ± SD, 40.4 ± 8.5 versus 34.3 ± 6.2 mL/100 g/min; P = .02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The regional cerebral blood flow was significantly higher in the 6 patients with antegrade internal carotid artery flow than those with internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> at rest (42.2 ± 7.2 versus 34.3 ± 6.2 mL/100 g/min; P = .02) but not in the other 4 patients without antegrade internal carotid artery flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Antegrade collateral internal carotid artery flow was found in 60% of patients with common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and was mainly supplied by retrograde external carotid artery flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It contributes to maintenance of middle cerebral artery territory regional cerebral blood flow </plain></SENT>
