<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The system bed contained <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> necessary equipment including a respirator, a cooling unit, physiological monitors, and a storage battery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Surface cooling of the patients was performed using water-circulating blankets, and core temperature was maintained based on bladder temperature and a feedback computer program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During hypothermic therapy, patient transfer and radiological examination including computed tomography and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography could be easily and safely performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Differences between the measured bladder temperature and the target temperature were approximately +/- 0.1 degree C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The proposed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> system bed may be useful for serial radiological examination of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
