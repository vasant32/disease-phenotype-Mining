<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A temporal profile of lateral and fourth ventricle rat choroid plexus (LVCP and 4VCP, respectively) tissue injury and recovery was determined using alterations in K, Na, and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29375,33813">H2O</z:chebi> content and ultrastructure after 10 min of transient forebrain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (TFI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At 0.5 h postischemia the LVCP displayed a maximum reduction in K content by 32% and a significant increase in Na content by 85% and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29375,33813">H2O</z:chebi> content by 22% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>LVCP tissue K, Na, and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29375,33813">H2O</z:chebi> content returned to sham values by 24 h postischemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ultrastructural changes appeared more severe between 0.5 and 12 h postischemia, whereas by 24 h, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ultrastructure was restored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Elevations in 4VCP tissue Na (P &lt; 0.05) and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="29375,33813">H2O</z:chebi> content, which were less than those in LVCP, gradually reached a maximum by 24 h compared with sham </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No change in 4VCP tissue ultrastructure was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that the LVCP tissue is more vulnerable than 4VCP in the bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> model but that it recovers in a timely manner after TFI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the ability of the LVCP tissue to rapidly recover suggests its functional importance in helping to restore brain homeostasis </plain></SENT>
