<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied 12 patients with internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion or tight stenosis but without vertebrobasilar and subclavian <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> who suffered <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042568" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vertebrobasilar insufficiency</z:e> (VBI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patients with ICA occlusion were compared with a sex- and age-matched control group that had ICA occlusion but no VBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Visible <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> on computed tomographic scan, greater size of visible <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath>, weak collateral circulation, and bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> of the ICA significantly correlated with the occurrence of VBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No significant difference was demonstrated for emboligenic lesions, but posterior to anterior flow through the posterior communicating arteries was demonstrated only in the patients with VBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These facts suggested hemodynamic disturbances with "steal VBI." In ICA tight stenosis, VBI symptoms disappeared after endarterectomy but persisted in patients with more than 50% stenosis; this was also suggestive of hemodynamic VBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042568" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Vertebrobasilar insufficiency</z:e> had a prognostic significance, being associated with an increased occurrence of delayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
