<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:chebi fb="5" ids="17967">urethane</z:chebi>-anesthetized rats, microinjections of the neuroexcitatory amino acid, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29988">L-glutamate</z:chebi> (150-300 ng/site) were used to functionally identify rostral ventrolateral vasopressor neuron pools (VLPA) and caudal ventrolateral vasodepressor neuron pools (VLDA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The bilateral microinjection of BMI into the ventrolateral vasodepressor neuron pool caused a dose-related (0.1-100.0 ng/site) decrease in blood pressure (BP), pulse pressure and heart rate (HR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Maximum decreases in BP and HR were 51 +/- 2 mm Hg and 245 +/- 9 beats/min, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the VLPA, BMI caused a dose-related (0.1-100.0 ng/site) increase in BP, HR and pulse pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Maximum increases in BP and HR were 88 +/- 3 mm Hg and 73 +/- 4 beats/min, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the VLPA, BMI also caused a 40% increase in the carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> response and a 48% reduction in the aortic depressor nerve response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It seems plausible that GABAergic mechanisms in both the caudal and rostral ventrolateral medulla are tonically involved with the maintenance and reflex regulation of vasomotor activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Medullary <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16865">gamma-aminobutyric acid</z:chebi> may provide a reciprocal inhibition between rostral vasopressor and caudal vasodepressor neuron pools </plain></SENT>
