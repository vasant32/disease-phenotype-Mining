<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although each of these patients was referred to the neurosurgical service for evaluation for an extracranial-intracranial microvascular bypass procedure, complete arteriographic evaluations of their cerebrovasculature suggested that alternative methods should be the treatment of choice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For each patient reported the ipsilateral external carotid artery was demonstrated by angiography to be an important source of collateral blood supply to the cerebral hemispheres or retinae distal to the occluded internal carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ten patients with no significant atherosclerotic narrowing or ulceration of the external carotid artery have remained free of symptoms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> for 6 to 40 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In twelve patients who developed delayed recurrent cerebral or <z:mp ids='MP_0006190'>retinal ischemia</z:mp> ipsilateral to their internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, there were found obstructive and/or ulcerative plaques involving the common and/or external carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thromboendarterectomy in 11 of these patients gave complete relief of ischemic symptoms during the 4 to 36 months of postoperative follow up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One of these 12 patients refused operation and went on to develop a major <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Angiographic identification of a functionally important external carotid artery ipsilateral to an internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> carries considerable prognostic and therapeutic significance </plain></SENT>
