<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of recanalization after endovascular therapy of symptomatic internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion on the presence of HV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eleven patients with symptomatic ICA occlusion were retrospectively enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Changes in the HV on FLAIR images were examined in affected hemisphere of each patient after successful treatment with endovascular recanalization (angioplasty, n = 3; stent-assisted angioplasty, n = 8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The relationship between postoperative changes in the HV and Thrombolysis In <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>Cerebral Ischemia</z:hpo> (TICI) scale (I-III) was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After operation, HV of the 11 affected hemispheres were showed to be decreased (n = 3) or disappeared (n = 8) in treated side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median interval between pre- and postoperative MRI examinations was 97.0 h (range, from 69. to 48.7h) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the 8 patients with disappeared HV, 7 achieved high TICI grade flow (III) and 1 had relatively low TICI grade flow (IIc) in treated side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the 3 patients with decreased HV were found to be relatively low TICI grade flow (IIc) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that endovascular recanalization of ICA occlusion was effective for decreasing HV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Postoperative decrease in HV can be considered as a marker for hemodynamic improvement </plain></SENT>
