<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A single dose of 1, 3 or 10 mg/kg of MK-801 gave significant protection of hippocampal CA1 and CA2 pyramidal neurons when administered during the occlusion and up to 24 h following the period of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A dose of 0.3 mg/kg was effective when administered during the occlusion period but gave no protection at 30 min or 2 h post-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Experiments in which MK-801 was administered in repeated doses indicated that significant protection was achieved with 1 mg/kg of MK-801 repeated post-ischaemically and with 1 mg/kg MK-801 supplemented with repeated doses of 0.3 mg/kg of MK-801 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However 0.3 mg/kg of MK-801 followed by repeated doses of 0.03 mg/kg administered post-ischaemically was not neuroprotective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that MK-801 can protect hippocampal neurons from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e>-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0002229'>neuronal degeneration</z:mp> when it is administered up to 24 h after the insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data provide further evidence that therapeutic intervention in the post-ischaemic period can successfully prevent neurodegenerative events, and that the delayed degeneration of hippocampal neurons following an ischaemic insult occurs by an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">N-methyl-D-aspartate</z:chebi> receptor-mediated process </plain></SENT>
