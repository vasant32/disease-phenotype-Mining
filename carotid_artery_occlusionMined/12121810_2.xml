<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To investigate the underlying mechanisms, Mongolian gerbils were pretreated with either vehicle or 3-NP at the dose of 3 or 10 mg/kg, intraperitoneal, 3 days prior to a 5-min bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> followed by either 48 h or 7 days of blood recirculation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neuronal damage was assessed by a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52815">cresyl violet</z:chebi>/fuchsin acid staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Induction of heat shock protein 72 (HSP72) and <z:chebi fb="70" ids="18291,35154">manganese</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase (MnSOD) expression was evaluated by Western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Astroglial and microglial activation was detected by immunohistochemistry (glial fibrillary acid protein) and by histochemistry (isolectin B4 staining), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Present data show that the hippocampal neuronal damage induced by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> were of similar extent between the vehicle- and 3-NP-treated gerbils, whatever the dose tested, indicating that 3-NP did not induce tolerance to transient forebrain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> under our experimental conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The lack of difference in the post-ischemic level of HSP72 and MnSOD protein expression and in the intensity of astroglial and microglial activation represents further indirect indications of the absence of 3-NP preconditioning effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, although chemical preconditioning with 3-NP is a well-established phenomenon at least in vitro and in models of focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, the relevance of 3-NP as a preconditioning molecule towards global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> remains an open question </plain></SENT>
