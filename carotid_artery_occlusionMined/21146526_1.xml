<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to investigate the evidence of ischemic susceptibility after aging and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four groups of rat were studied: young normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rat, aged normotensive WKY rat, young spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) and aged SHR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Brain images were acquired at a 3.0T Tim-Trio MRI system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For diffusion-weighted images, apparent diffusion coefficient (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>) was measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Relative cerebral blood flow (CBF) was also calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cerebral ischemic susceptibility was examined by using ischemic model of bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the MRI study of non-ischemic rat, aged SHR had significantly higher <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> (P&lt;0.01) and significantly lower CBF (P&lt;0.01) in the parietal cortex, but aged WKY rat had only significantly lower CBF (P&lt;0.01) when compared with young WKY rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>/CBF ratio in the parietal cortex was significantly higher in aged SHR when compared with young WKY rat, young SHR and aged WKY rat (P&lt;0.01, P&lt;0.05, P&lt;0.05, respectively) suggesting a significant diffusion-perfusion disparity in aged SHR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, there was significantly larger damage in the parietal cortex of aged SHR when compared with young WKY rat, young SHR and aged WKY rat (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P&lt;0.05), but not in the hippocampus and thalamus (P&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our study demonstrated a significantly increased <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> value and reduced CBF in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-vulnerable cortical area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This cerebral diffusion-perfusion disparity is seen mainly in aged rat and can be more evident if associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> indicating an increased susceptibility of brain tissue to ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
