<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Clinical effects of internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion may range from the absolute absence of symptoms to lethal hemispheric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this paper symptoms of patients with ICA occlusion have been related to the development of collateral circulation, different types of developed collateral circulation have been assessed, and the degree of sensitivity and specificity of duplex scan has been appraised </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-eight patients with ICA occlusion or subocclusion, 24 males and 24 females, aged between 50 and 83 years (67.7+/-7.15), underwent duplex scan and magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nineteen patients were completely asymptomatic, 20 patients showed permanent neurological symptoms and 9 patients had shown transient symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twelve patients (25%) did not show any collateral circulation, 29 patients (60%) showed collateral circulation through homolateral external carotid artery branches and 7 patients (15%) showed collateral circulation through other circuits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the 20 patients with permanent symptoms only 8 showed collateral circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the 19 asymptomatic patients and the 9 patients with transient symptoms showed collateral circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eventually, duplex scan showed 78% sensitivity, 100%, specificity and 83% diagnostic accuracy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our data show: 1) a clear-cut prevalence of collateral circulation through homolateral external carotid artery branches with respect to other possible collateral circulation; 2) an inverse relationship between the development of collateral circulation and the appearance of permanent symptoms; 3) a good diagnostic accuracy of duplex scan in revealing collateral circulation in the case of ICA occlusion </plain></SENT>
