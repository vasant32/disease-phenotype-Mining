<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 12% blood pressure elevation was found during common carotid occlusion in the barodenervated, thoracotomised cat under <z:chebi fb="4" ids="7983">Nembutal</z:chebi> anaesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This rise in blood pressure appeared to be the net result of an 18% increase of total peripheral resistance and a concomitant 5% decrease of mean aortic flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When the occlusions were repeated after ganglionic blockade similar values were found, indicating that the increase in resistance had not resulted from reflex vasoconstriction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To test if this increase of total peripheral resistance was caused by a mechanical exclusion, Ohm's law for parallel resistances was applied to the systemic tree to calculate the rise in resistance due to obstruction of the carotid flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results thus obtained matched the observed increase of peripheal resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> can be used to test completeness of barodenervation in the cat, if an increase in blood pressure of about 12% is allowed for </plain></SENT>
