<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Carotid angioplasty with stenting (CAS) is becoming accepted as an effective and reliable treatment option for severe carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it is rarely applied for carotid occlusion, especially in its <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report our experience of CAS for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> representing compromised cerebral blood flow using various protection methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A 77-year-old woman, who was already diagnosed with severe left internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp>, suddenly had right <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At that time, she was treated conservatively because her neurological status was quite good, in spite of left carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Her symptoms improved in the short term, except slight <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo>, but deteriorated again 18 days from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed new ischemic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CAS was then performed for the occluded carotid artery on the 23rd day from the first <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Using the proximal protection technique, the occluded lesion was crossed carefully with a microguidewire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Stents were also placed successfully with the distal protection technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The occluded carotid artery was completely recanalized without any unfavorable events or neurological deterioration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In this patient, CAS was successfully to treat <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These procedures and techniques are reviewed and discussed </plain></SENT>
