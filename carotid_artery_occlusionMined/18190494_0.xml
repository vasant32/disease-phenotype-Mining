<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Several methods are being used to assess cerebral vasomotor reactivity (CVR), including transcranial Doppler (TCD) sonography and blood oxygenation level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim was to assess the correlation of TCD and fMRI in the CVR assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Study group consisted of 28 patients (24 males, 4 females; aged 30-82, mean 63.1 +/- 10.0 years), presenting with 29 occluded internal carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The TCD examination, including breath-holding/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002883'>hyperventilation</z:hpo> test (BH/HV) and breath-holding index (BHI), and fMRI examination were used for the assessment of CVR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>fMRI employed a bimanual motor task within both a block paradigm and an event-related paradigm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cohen's kappa was applied when statistically assessing correlation of the methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The following correlations were found--between BH/HV and BHI 58.6%, kappa= .205; BH/HV and fMRI 65.5%, kappa= .322; BHI and fMRI 58.6%, kappa= .151; TCD (consistent result of both BH/HV and BHI test) and fMRI 70.6%, kappa= .414 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In the evaluation of CVR, there is only a minimal correlation between the particular TCD tests (both BH/HV and BHI), and fMRI examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, there is a moderate correlation between TCD and fMRI in the case of congruity of both TCD tests </plain></SENT>
