<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To assess the reactivity of astrocytes in transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> of the gerbil, we studied the levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and its <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>GFAP <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> increased by 4 h after carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, reached peak levels by 72 h with a 12-fold increase over control and then started declining as early as 96 h postischemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An examination of the specific regions of the brain revealed an increase in GFAP <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> associated with the forebrain, midbrain, hippocampus and striatum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>GFAP <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in the non-ischemic cerebellum however, remained expressed at constitutively low levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunoblot analysis with anti-GFAP antibodies demonstrated a 2- to 3-fold increase in the protein after 24 and 48 h of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7983">pentobarbital</z:chebi> and 1-(5'-oxohexyl)-3-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-7-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="26308">propyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15318,17712">xanthine</z:chebi> (HWA 285), the drugs that have been shown to protect against ischemic damage, prevented the increase in GFAP <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in the cortex following ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Forebrain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> also induced vimentin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein quantities by 12 h of reperfusion in the cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The levels of c-fos and preproenkephalin <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> increased rapidly within 1 h after ischemic injury, demonstrating a temporal difference in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> changes following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that an increase in GFAP and vimentin, the two glial intermediate filament proteins in the area of the ischemic lesion may be associated with a glial response to injury </plain></SENT>
