<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we have investigated the protective effects of a nonthiazolidinedione PPARγ <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi>, N-(2-benzoylphenyl)-O-[2-(<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-2-pyridinylamino)ethyl]-l-tyrosine (GW1929), against global cerebral IR injury induced neurobehavioral deficits and brain damage in gerbils </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hippocampal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegeneration</z:hpo> after cerebral IR injury was also associated with significant increase in iNOS and MMP-9 immunoreactivity along with TNFα and IL-6 levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Massive apoptotic DNA fragmentation as evident from increased TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi> nick end labelling)-positive cells was also observed in the CA1 hippocampal region of IR challenged gerbils </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In summary, this study demonstrates neuroprotective effects of GW1929 in global cerebral IR injury induced neurobehavioral deficits and brain pathology which may be attributed to reduced <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and apoptotic DNA fragmentation, suggesting therapeutic potential of PPARγ <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> in cerebral IR injury </plain></SENT>
