<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is also evidence that intraoperative and postoperative hypotention may cause contralateral hemodynamic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As such, contralateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> is regarded as a risk factor for carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we report on five cases of severe ICA stenosis with contralateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusions</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cerebral blood flow(CBF) and cerebral vasoreactivity( CVR) of the contralateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusions</z:mp> were measured before and after CAS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the influence that ipsilateral CAS exerted on the occluded side was examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>(123)I-<z:chebi fb="54" ids="17202">IMP</z:chebi> SPECT was performed before and after CAS, both at rest and at the time of acetazoramide administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The CBF was evaluated quantitatively using the ARG method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean CBF of the treated side rose from 30.0 +/- 7.1 ml/100g/min to 34.4 +/- 8.3 ml/100g/min (p &lt; 0.05), and the mean CBF of the occluded side similarly rose from 28.3 +/- 6.1 ml/100g/min to 31.7 +/- 6.4 ml/100g/min (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Correspondingly, the regional CVR (rCVR) increased from 5.9% +/- 16.3% to 35.0% +/- 16.4%(p &lt; 0.05) on the treated side, and from 3.7% +/- 14.7% to 10.7% +/- 16.9% (p &lt; 0.05) on the occluded side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This demonstrates that ipsilateral CAS seems to improve both CBF and CVR on the contralateral occluded side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The fact that some cases developed cross flow from the anterior communicating artery was both remarkable and significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Where there was poor cross flow from the anterior communicating artery, improvement in cerebral vaso reactivity was limited </plain></SENT>
