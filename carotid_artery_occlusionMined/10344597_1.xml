<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined the cerebral blood flow (CBF) threshold to produce regional differences in HSP72 induction after transient forebrain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Female SHRs were subjected to 20 min of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> induced by bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The CBF was measured by laser Doppler flowmetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At forty-eight hours after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and reperfusion, the rats were decapitated and the brains were removed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Specific areas (hippocampal CA1, CA2-3, dentate gyrus, dorsolateral and ventromedial striatum, and parietal cortex) were thereafter dissected from the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The amounts of HSP72 in these samples were determined using Western blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the hippocampus, HSP72 was induced when the CBF decreased to less than 18-25% of the resting level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean values of HSP72 produced in the CA1 area, CA2-3 area, and the dentate gyrus following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and reperfusion treatment were 4.44 +/- 1.43 (+/-SD) ng/microg protein, 3.51 +/- 0.72 ng/microg protein and 3.77 +/- 1.05 ng/microg protein, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the parietal cortex, the amount of HSP72 induction was less pronounced (2.55 +/- 0.40 ng/microg protein), while HSP72 was hardly detected at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> in the striatum, even under conditions of very severe CBF reduction and reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated the existence of both a CBF threshold (i.e., approximately 20% of the resting level) for HSP72 induction and regional <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> for the induction of HSP72 protein </plain></SENT>
