<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two groups were identified: 19 patients had already occluded their arteries on entry to the study, and 21 progressed to occlusion during the course of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> occurred in the first group during follow-up, and the annual <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate in the second group was 3.8% for the territory of the occluded artery and 5.7% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> vascular territories </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>Death</z:hpo> rate was 6.6% annually for both groups, mainly cardiac </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transcranial Doppler with digital compression of each carotid artery demonstrated middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) dependent on the patent carotid being total in 50% and partial in 30% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between degree of stenosis and <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> dependency (r = -0.24) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our data on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk in asymptomatic patients with unilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> indicate a benign outcome </plain></SENT>
