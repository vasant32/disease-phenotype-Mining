<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Ischemia</z:e> was induced by bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (for 7 min) in male Mongolian gerbils (Meriones unguiculatus) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ischemic postconditioning protocol comprised 3 cycles of 15 s reperfusion/15 s <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After 48 h of reperfusion, CA1 neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was detected by Nissl staining and the cytoplasmic LDH was demonstrated histochemically in CA1 area of the hippocampus with a quantitative cytophotometric assessment of the enzyme activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results have shown that 7 min <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> resulted in a significant decrease in the number of viable neurons (up to 24%) in the CA1 area of hippocampus; in addition, it reduced the activity of LDH in these neurons (from 0.260 +/- 0.009 to 0.190 +/- 0.006 relative units) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The application of ischemic postconditioning significantly increased the number of viable neurons (up to 52.9%, P &lt; 0.01) in the CA1 area of hippocampus, and it was accompanied by an increase in the activity of LDH (0.240 +/- 0.008 relative units, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
