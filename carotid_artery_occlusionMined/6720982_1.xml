<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We found that P/ Qra relations were linear with an extrapolated zero flow intercept (Ped, effective downstream pressure) of 20.8 +/- 1.9 mmHg and the reciprocal of the slope (Ra, arterial resistance) of 0.6 +/- 0.04 mm Hg X ml-1 X min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These values are markedly lower than the values found in similar experiments in coronary and femoral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Raising renal venous pressure (5 dogs) decreased Qra and elevated Ra and Ped in the ipsilateral renal artery while decreasing Qra and elevating Ra but not Ped in the contralateral renal artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (6 dogs) decreased Qra and elevated Ra and Ped </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Alpha-Adrenergic blockade (4 dogs) lowered Ped and Ra </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Arterial resistance seems to be more important for change in P/Q relations in the renal arterial bed than it is in other arterial beds investigated so far </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We suggest that the effective downstream pressure to renal arterial flow is downstream from the glomerular capillaries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The location of the "vascular waterfall " phenomenon appears to be between the intrarenal veins and the veins outside the capsule </plain></SENT>
