<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the contribution of the MAP kinase c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), to neonatal HI brain damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>JNK regulates several transcriptional (via AP-1 activation) and non-transcriptional processes involved in brain damage such as <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>/survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>P7 rats were subjected to HI by unilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>HI-induced activation of cerebral AP-1 peaked at 3-6h post-HI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intraperitoneal administration of the JNK-inhibitor TAT-JBD immediately after HI prevented AP-1 activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>TAT-JBD treatment within 3h after HI reduced early neuronal damage by approximately 30% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>JNK/AP-1 inhibition did not reduce HI-induced cytokine/chemokine expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Analysis of indicators of apoptotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> revealed that TAT-JBD markedly reduced the HI-induced increase in active caspase 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, the upstream mediators of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>: active caspase 8, cleaved Bid, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18070">cytochrome c</z:chebi> release and caspase 9 cleavage were not reduced after TAT-JBD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>TAT-JBD inhibited the HI-induced increase in Smac/DIABLO, an inhibitor of IAPs that prevent activation of caspase 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>TAT-JBD treatment also reduced cleavage of alpha-fodrin, indicating that calpain-mediated brain damage was reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Neuroprotection by TAT-JBD treatment was long-lasting as gray- and white matter damage was diminished by approximately 50% at 14 weeks post-HI concomitantly with marked improvement of sensorimotor behavior and cognitive functioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, JNK inhibition by TAT-JBD treatment reduced neonatal HI brain damage with a therapeutic window of 3h and long-lasting anatomical and behavioral improvements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>We propose that inhibition of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> Smac/DIABLO release and calpain activation contribute to neuroprotection by TAT-JBD </plain></SENT>
