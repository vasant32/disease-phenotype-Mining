<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Cats subjected to common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> developed a waxing and waning of respiratory amplitude recurring with a period of 24 s (range 10-60) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Occasionally the waning phase terminated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apnea</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This respiratory pattern, reminiscent of "periodic" breathing, was usually associated with an oscillation of sympathetic neural activity, and of systemic arterial pressure, of the same period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A similar pattern of modulation of phrenic nerve activity was observed during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0700323,C0235062" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Therapeutic or Preventive Procedure" abbrv="">neuromuscular block</z:e> and artificial ventilation and when, at the same time, the associated systemic arterial pressure oscillation was eliminated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that this breathing pattern is not the result of an analogous pattern in the discharge of gas tension-sensitive and/or blood flow- and pressure-sensitive receptors that is fed back to the central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system (<z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hence the pattern must be generated within the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> with no need of rhythmic sensory information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The pattern can be accounted for by the assumption that the central respiratory drive potentials are riding on top of a slow oscillation of phrenic motoneuron membrane potential with a 24-s period </plain></SENT>
