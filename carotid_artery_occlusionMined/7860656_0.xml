<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have recently demonstrated the age-related vulnerability of hippocampal neurons to 20-min forebrain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we investigated the effect of aging on the release of amino acids in the hippocampus during transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> for 20 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Concentrations of extracellular amino acids and cerebral blood flow in the CA1 subfield were examined by an in vivo brain dialysis technique and a hydrogen clearance method, respectively, in adult (5-7 month) and aged (19-23 month) female SHR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> by bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, cerebral blood flow to the hippocampus decreased to 20% of the resting values in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After recirculation, both groups showed delayed hypoperfusion which was more prominent in the aged SHR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the adult rats, concentrations of both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> increased to approximately 8-fold of the resting values during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The elevation of these excitatory amino acids in the adult SHR was not significantly different from that in the aged rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the concentration of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15891">taurine</z:chebi> increased 26-fold in the adult SHR but only 16-fold in the aged rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Changes in other amino acids were not different between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that an imbalance of excitatory and inhibitory amino acids, e.g., smaller release of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="15891">taurine</z:chebi>, during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> may, at least in part, contribute to the age-related vulnerability of hippocampal neurons to transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in SHR </plain></SENT>
