<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this setting, a stenotic lesion of the external carotid artery can result in hypoperfusion as well as lead to embolic phenomena via enlarged collaterals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This is a report of an experience with six external carotid endarterectomies in five patients from April 1983 to March 1986 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> five of the patients had an internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> ipsilateral to a significant external carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each patient had symptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0241832" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebrovascular insufficiency</z:e> with four of the five patients demonstrating clear cut symptoms, which lateralized to the side with external <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> and internal carotid occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These symptoms included <z:hpo ids='HP_0100576'>amaurosis fugax</z:hpo> in four patients and transient extremity <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four out of five patients were completely relieved of their symptoms after external carotid endarterectomy with follow up periods ranging from 6 months to 2 and one half years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no perioperative neurological deficits or complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The duplex scan was useful in identifying possible candidates for this operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Important technical details include use of an arterial shunt and closure of the internal carotid artery stump, which may be a source of further emboli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that with appropriate patient selection, external carotid endarterectomy can be safely employed with gratifying results in patients with advanced cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
