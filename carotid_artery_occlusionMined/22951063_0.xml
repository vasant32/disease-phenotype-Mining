<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (CAO) is a risk factor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> ipsilateral to the occlusion and puts patients in a high-risk category when contralateral endarterectomy is performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the long-term outcomes of patients with internal CAO and to determine risk factors predictive of subsequent neurological event, contralateral carotid intervention, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with internal CAO shown by duplex ultrasonography were retrospectively identified and followed between January 2002 and June 2010 (follow-up: 1-101 months, mean: 52 months) at a tertiary care hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> had multiple duplex examinations available for review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Chi-square analysis was used to determine risk factors for neurologic event, contralateral intervention, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause morality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multivariate Cox proportional hazard analysis was conducted using univariate risk factors with P values &lt;0.1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method (P &lt; 0.05 significant) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eighty patients with internal CAO were identified and available for analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On initial encounter, 30 (38%) were symptomatic, with 26 (87%) having symptoms referable to the side of the occluded internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>During follow-up, seven (9%) had a neurologic event, of which six (86%) were referable to the occluded side; 14 (18%) patients underwent a contralateral operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Nineteen (24%) patients died during the period of study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although numerous variables of multivessel disease were significant with χ(2) analysis, there was no significant risk factor associated with neurologic event on multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, the development of a hemodynamically significant stenosis (&gt;50%) or occlusion of the external carotid artery (ECA) ipsilateral to the occlusion on follow-up (P &lt; 0.027) was associated with increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier analysis showed 7-year survival for patients with ECA disease at follow-up was significantly worse (16.2% ± 10.3% [n = 21] vs. 79% ± 8.7% [n = 59]; P &lt; 0.00001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Frequently, patients present with neurological symptoms referable to the side of the internal CAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Eighty-six percent of neurologic events that occur in follow-up are attributable to the side of the occluded carotid, indicating that the occluded side continues to contribute to neurologic morbidity over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis revealed no single factor to be predictive of subsequent neurologic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>With significant risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in patients found to have ipsilateral ECA stenosis during follow-up, it seems reasonable to continue surveillance of the occluded carotid </plain></SENT>
