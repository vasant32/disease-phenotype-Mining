<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: In this case report we describe a successful interdisciplinary approach (including flow redirection and endovascular occlusion) applied to a patient with a continuously growing extracranial giant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the right internal carotid artery (ICA) due to known <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Ehlers-Danlos syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CASE PRESENTATION: A 42-year-old man with a continuously growing extracranial giant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> of the right ICA sought treatment after failed surgery of a similar lesion of the left ICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A multidisciplinary consultation was held at the end of 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>TREATMENT STRATEGY: The treatment strategy consisted of flow redirection in order to secure sufficient cerebral perfusion prior to surgical trapping of the carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Flow redirection was achieved by placement of a double-barrel extracranial-intracranial bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subsequent surgical trapping failed due to the extreme size of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo>, making certain identification of surrounding structures impossible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was then successfully occluded by neuroradiological intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In a further procedure, a large intra-aneurysmal <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> was surgically removed to reduce the remaining bulging <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> sac </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This case report describes a successful interdisciplinary approach for the treatment of a rare giant extracranial ICA <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> in a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013720" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Ehlers-Danlos syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Treatment options for this type are few and carry high risks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Flow redirection via extracranial-intracranial bypass followed by endovascular occlusion appears to be a good treatment approach </plain></SENT>
