<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have previously reported neuroprotective properties of Ginkgo biloba/EGb 761(®) (EGb 761) in transient and permanent mouse models of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a quest to extend our studies on EGB 761 and its constituents further, we used a model of transient global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> induced delayed hippocampal neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mice pretreated with different test drugs for 7 days were subjected to eight-minute bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (tBCCAO) at day 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After 7 days of reperfusion, mice brains were dissected out for TUNEL assay and immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In-situ detection of fragmented DNA (TUNEL staining) showed that out of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> test drugs, only EGb 761 (13.6% ± 3.2) pretreatment protected neurons in the hippocampus against global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (vs. vehicle, 85.1% ± 9.9; p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunofluorescence-based studies demonstrated that pretreatment with EGb 761 upregulated the expression levels of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> oxygenase 1 (HO1), nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) as compared to the vehicle group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, increased number of activated astrocytes and microglia in the vehicle group was observed to be significantly lower in the EGb 761 pretreated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Together, these results suggest that EGb 761 is a multifunctional neuroprotective agent, and the protection is in part associated with activation of the HO1/Nrf2 pathway, upregulation of VEGF and downregulation of <z:mp ids='MP_0002501'>inflammatory mediators</z:mp> such as astrocytes and microglia </plain></SENT>
