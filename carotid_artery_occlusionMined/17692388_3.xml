<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the inconsistent occurrence of posterior communicating arteries (PcomA) in mice might cause high outcome variability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To determine a means for reducing variability, CD1 mice were subjected to bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> for 12-40 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Occlusion duration&gt; or =18 min was applied to mice with bilateral regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF)&gt; or =10% of baseline at 2.5 min of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, only groups with ischemic duration&lt; or =18 min were used for statistical analysis because of the high mortality in the other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After 7 days, patency of PcomA and hippocampal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002529'>neuronal loss</z:hpo> in the CA1 subfield were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Outcome variability was reduced when hemispheres containing PcomA were excluded from analysis; ischemic outcome was not affected by the presence of a contralateral PcomA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Extending ischemic duration based on rCBF did not reduce outcome variability because the initial rCBF could not reliably predict PcomA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, after an optimal ischemic duration, evaluating hippocampal injury in each hemisphere independently according to the existence of PcomA is an effective and reliable method to obtain consistent results in this pre-clinical mouse model </plain></SENT>
