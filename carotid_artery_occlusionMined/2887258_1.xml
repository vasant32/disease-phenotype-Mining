<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We used a well characterized <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1519106" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="">rodent model</z:e> for perinatal hypoxic-ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo>, unilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> followed by exposure to 8% oxygen for 2.5 h in 7-day-old rat pups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This preparation results in focal neuronal damage in striatum, hippocampus, and cortex ipsilateral to ligation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Alterations in the regional distribution of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> binding in the first 24 h after the insult were assessed with quantitative in vitro [3H]<z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> autoradiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In lesioned animals, we found progressive selective reductions in [3H]<z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> binding in forebrain ipsilateral to ligation in regions destined for neuronal damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The earliest and most prominent unilateral reductions in binding were noted in the dentate gyrus of hippocampus (-45 +/- 9%, compared with contralateral hemisphere at 24 h) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> reductions in specific <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> binding appear to be a sensitive marker for hypoxic-ischemic neuronal damage in the immature brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest that neurons bearing <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> receptors may be particularly susceptible to hypoxic-ischemic injury </plain></SENT>
