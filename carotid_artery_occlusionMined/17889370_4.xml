<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The contrast-agent free 3D time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography (TOF-MRA), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and T2-weighted imaging by 3.0-T <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> clinical scanner were applied when unilateral middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) was occluded and reopened, and after bilateral common carotid arteries were in ligation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The arterial angiograms of the rat brain and neck were achieved successfully in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> chosen directions by the 3D TOF-MRA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It was shown that <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> in occlusion presented no signal in MRA, and the parenchyma of the ipsilateral <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory hypointensity signal in maps of apparent diffusion coefficient (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After reperfusion, the signal intensity of ipsilateral <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> was resumed in MRA, and the decreased <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> was restored simultaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, after 5h of reperfusion, it was found that the value of <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> deteriorated second time with high T2 value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (BCCAO) rats, it can be confirmed by MRA that the effectively occluded BCCA presented the absent signal and the basilar artery became tortuous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As a result, MRA by clinical scanner was proved of a valuable method to validate transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) and permanent BCCAO rat model </plain></SENT>
