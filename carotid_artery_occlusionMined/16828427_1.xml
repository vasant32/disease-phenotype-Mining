<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The natural history of patients with carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> is controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A few studies have concluded that patients with internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> carry a high risk of neurologic events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>None of these previously reported studies analyze the natural history of internal <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> contralateral to carotid endarterectomy (CEA), except for a small series including a subset of patients from two randomized trials, the Asymptomatic Carotid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>Atherosclerosis</z:hpo> Study and the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study analyzes the natural history of patients with carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> contralateral to CEA, specifically assessing long-term neurologic events occurring in the hemisphere associated with the occluded carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Of the 599 CEAs in 544 patients that were included in two previously updated prospective studies, 63 patients had contralateral internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, and their perioperative and long-term outcomes were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to estimate the rate of freedom from late <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> occurring in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the occluded carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-free survival rate was also noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean follow-up was 58 months (range, 1 to 147 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (1.6%) occurred, which was not in the cerebral hemisphere ipsilateral to the occluded carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two late <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> (3.2%) and nine <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo>) (14.3%) occurred involving the hemisphere of the occluded carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There were also three late <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> (4.8%) and no late <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> involving the hemisphere supplied by the operative site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were a total of 14 late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients had late &gt; or =50% restenosis of the operative side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Six of these had neurologic events (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>) involving the hemisphere of the occluded carotid artery, in contrast to five of 48 patients with no restenosis who had neurologic symptoms (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Freedom from late <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the occluded carotid artery at 1, 3, 5, and 10 years was 98%, 96%, 96%, and 96%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-free survival rates at 1, 3, 5, and 10 years were 90%, 87%, 80%, and 59%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The natural history of carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> contralateral to CEA is relatively benign </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>This may suggest a protective effect of carotid endarterectomy on the cerebral hemisphere ipsilateral to the carotid occlusion from late <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
