<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential neuroprotective effects of lamotrigine, a novel <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">antiepileptic</z:chebi> drug that inhibits the release of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> in vitro, with both behavioral and histological measures of global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in gerbils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The common carotid arteries of gerbils were occluded for either 5, 10, or 15 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one days after reperfusion, gerbils were tested for impairments in a spatial memory task (<z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water maze</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After water maze testing the animals were killed, and damage to hippocampal pyramidal cells was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The effect of lamotrigine on the behavioral and histological outcome of either 5 or 15 minutes of global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Bilateral occlusion of the common carotid arteries for 5 minutes resulted in severe degeneration of hippocampal CA1 and CA2 pyramidal cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Lamotrigine significantly prevented loss of hippocampal CA1 neurons when administered acutely (100 mg/kg PO) immediately after reperfusion or when administered in two equal doses of 30 or 50 mg/kg 2 hours before and immediately after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Gerbils subjected to 5 minutes of ischemic insult were not impaired in their ability to solve a spatial memory task 21 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, gerbils subjected to 10 and 15 minutes of carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> showed significant impairment in their ability to solve a water maze task </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Lamotrigine significantly protected against the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive deficits</z:hpo> associated with 15 minutes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Histologically, increased durations of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> resulted in a progressive loss of CA1, CA2, and CA3 pyramidal cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Lamotrigine completely protected gerbils exposed to 15 minutes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> against CA3 cell loss and greatly reduced damage to the CA1 and CA2 cell tracts of the hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Lamotrigine also reduced the mortality associated with 15 minutes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Lamotrigine had neuroprotective effects in a gerbil model of global <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Lamotrigine protected gerbils against behavioral deficits resulting from 15 minutes of carotid occlusion and also prevented histological damage resulting from 5 and 15 minutes of global <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
