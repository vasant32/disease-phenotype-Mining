<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine the predictors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in patients undergoing CABG, we collected data on 472 consecutive patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From March 1991 to March 1999, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients undergoing CABG at our institution underwent routine duplex scanning of the extracranial carotid and vertebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seven patients with symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> were treated by carotid endarterectomy (CEA) before CABG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was a 10-fold increase in mortality (12.5%) associated with postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Many variables were analyzed by a multivariate technique and the severity of extracranial carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> was determined to be the only independent predictor of postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>None of the patients with carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and none of the patients who underwent CEA before CABG experienced a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: To reduce the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate, the indications for prophylactic CEA may be extended for asymptomatic patients with carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> greater than 75% </plain></SENT>
