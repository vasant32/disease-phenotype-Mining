<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To understand and potentially treat the lifelong cognitive and motor deficits in humans resulting from perinatal mild cerebral hypoxic-ischemic (HI) events, valid animal models are of high importance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nowadays the murine model of neonatal cerebral HI-injury (unilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> followed by <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>) is applied more frequently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study we investigated motor, behavioral and cognitive functioning in mice with mild cerebral HI-injury (45 min of <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>; HI-45) in comparison to mice exposed to severe HI (HI-75) and sham-control mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Lateralizing motor disturbances as measured using the cylinder rearing test developed in both HI-45 and HI-75 mice and was significantly more severe in HI-75 animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To assess behavior and cognitive functions, we used the modified hole board (mHB) test in two stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>First, the ability of the animals to find the three food rewards in cued holes over time was determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results revealed an overall learning impairment in HI-75 mice, while HI-45 mice were not different from sham controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the second stage, a reversal test was performed with rewarded cylinders being non-cued and non-rewarded cylinders being cued </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This reversal-task revealed impairments in cognitive flexibility in HI-45 mice as compared to sham-control animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our data indicate that both the cylinder rearing task and the two stages of the mHB are suitable behavioral approaches to differentiate consequences of neonatal mild and severe brain damage on executive functioning </plain></SENT>
