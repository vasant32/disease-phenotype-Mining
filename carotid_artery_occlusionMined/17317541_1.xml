<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The present study was performed to further investigate whether genetically overexpressing nonmitogenic human acidic fibroblast growth factor in cardiomyocytes provides similar protection from the cytotoxic effect of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="16240">hydrogen peroxide</z:chebi> and whether in vivo administration of nonmitogenic human acidic fibroblast growth factor attenuates <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion-induced cardiac dysfunction and tissue damage and protects the carotid sinus baroreceptor from alcohol-induced damage, as shown by a reduced response of blood pressure to short carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Cardiomyocytes transfected by nonmitogenic human acidic fibroblast growth factor, with significant increases in the cellular expression and secretion of nonmitogenic human acidic fibroblast growth factor into a culture medium, were resistant to <z:chebi fb="17" ids="16240">hydrogen-peroxide</z:chebi>-induced cytotoxicity, as measured by cell viability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hearts isolated from rats pretreated with saline, human acidic fibroblast growth factor, or nonmitogenic human acidic fibroblast growth factor for 24 h were subjected to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion in the Langendorff system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion induced cardiac dysfunction in the saline group, but not in the group pretreated with human acidic fibroblast growth factor or nonmitogenic human acidic fibroblast growth factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Ischemia</z:e>/reperfusion also caused a release of the cardiac enzyme lactic dehydrogenase into-and an increase in <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="39" ids="44785">peroxide</z:chebi> content in the efflux of-the hearts of saline-treated rats, but not in rats pretreated with human acidic fibroblast growth factor or nonmitogenic human acidic fibroblast growth factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in cardioprotective effects between human acidic fibroblast growth factor and nonmitogenic human acidic fibroblast growth factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the protective effect of in-vivo-administered nonmitogenic acidic fibroblast growth factor on alcohol-induced damage to the carotid sinus baroreceptor, as shown by the reduced response of blood pressure to short carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, was also observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that nonmitogenic human acidic fibroblast growth factor, similar to the native human acidic fibroblast growth factor, provides significant cardiovascular protection from oxidative damage in vitro and in vivo </plain></SENT>
