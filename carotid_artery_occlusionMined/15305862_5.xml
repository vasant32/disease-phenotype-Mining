<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To investigate the in vivo apoptotic machinery in oxygen deprived brain, we examined the expression of caspase-9 and caspase-3 in the hippocampus of Mongolian gerbils subjected to either transient <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> (4% O2 for 6 min) or forebrain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (10 min bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>) followed by 8 h to 7 days of reoxygenation or blood recirculation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Apoptotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was characterized by isolating hippocampal genomic DNA and analysing DNA fragmentation as well as histological studies including TUNEL assay and toluidine blue staining of brain sections </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results showed that both hypoxic and ischemic gerbil brains exhibited an increase in caspase-9 and caspase-3 gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, no cell damage was detectable following <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>, while marked DNA fragmentation and extensive cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was observed following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, although <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> did not lead to cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, both <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> were associated with cleavage of procaspase-9 and procaspase-3 and increases in their activities as well as cleavage of poly(<z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="33942">ribose</z:chebi>) polymerase-1 (PARP-1), a major caspase-3 substrate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that, in vivo, even late apoptotic events such as caspase activation and PARP-1 cleavage in hypoxic brains do not necessarily induce an irreversible commitment to apoptotic neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
