<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Renal nerve activity was increased by carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> while renal perfusion pressure was held constant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Linear correlation was determined by plotting the percent change from control for each dependent variable vs. the percent change in mean renal nerve activity (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">MRNA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The percent changes from control for <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> excretion and urinary flow were negatively correlated with percent change from control in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">MRNA</z:chebi> (P less than 0.01), and the percent change from control for renin release was positively correlated with percent change from control in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">MRNA</z:chebi> (P less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>NE overflow was observed to increase as renal nerve activity increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that physiologically elicited increases in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">MRNA</z:chebi> from 10 to greater than 100% are significantly correlated with changes in <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> excretion, urine flow, and renin release with little or no measurable change in GFR, RPF, or <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> excretion </plain></SENT>
