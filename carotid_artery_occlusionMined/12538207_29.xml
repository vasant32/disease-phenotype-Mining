<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated whether the neuroprotection previously seen with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4466">dexmedetomidine</z:chebi> or S(+)-ketamine involves regulation of proapoptotic (Bax and p53) and antiapoptotic (Bcl-2 and Mdm-2) proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rats were anesthetized with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After surgical preparation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> was discontinued, animals were randomly assigned to receive fentanyl and nitrous <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (N(2)O)/oxygen plus 100 microg/kg of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4466">dexmedetomidine</z:chebi> intraperitoneally 30 min before <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (n = 8), 1 mg x kg(-1) x min(-1) of S(+)-ketamine and oxygen/air (n = 8), or fentanyl and N(2)O/oxygen (n = 8; control group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three treatment groups, incomplete <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> (30 min) was induced by unilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and hemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> to a mean arterial blood pressure of 30-35 mm Hg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four hours after the start of reperfusion, the brains were removed, and the expression of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-regulating proteins was determined by using immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results were compared with sham-operated animals (n = 8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion, the relative protein concentration of Bax was increased by 110% in control animals compared with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4466">dexmedetomidine</z:chebi>- and S(+)-ketamine-treated rats and by 140% compared with the sham-operated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In animals treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4466">dexmedetomidine</z:chebi>, the expression of Bcl-2 and Mdm-2 was larger compared with control (68% and 210%, respectively) or sham-operated (110% and 180%, respectively) animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it is possible that the neuroprotective properties of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4466">dexmedetomidine</z:chebi> and S(+)-ketamine seen in previous studies involve ultra-early modulation of the balance between pro- and antiapoptotic proteins </plain></SENT>
