<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ischemic insult was induced in Long-Evans, black-hooded 1-week-old rats by unilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> followed by 2.5 h of <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> in 8% O2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One week later, animals received neocortical block transplants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At 2-6 weeks posttransplantation, animals were sacrificed and their brains examined histologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transplants survived in over 80% of the animals and the presence of acetylcholinesterase-positive fibers crossing the host-transplant interface provided evidence of transplant integration with the host brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, morphometric measurements revealed that the transplants were unable to reduce the <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-induced degeneration in the host hippocampus, caudate-putamen, or thalamus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless the demonstrated survival of grafts in the neonatal <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> model suggests a potential therapeutic effect </plain></SENT>
