<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 63-year-old man with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006510'>chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</z:hpo> experienced several episodes of cough-induced left <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo> during drinking and smoking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Selective cerebral angiography demonstrated right ICAO at the vessel origin, with 50% stenosis of the left internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Collateral circulation from the right external to internal carotid artery branches and through the anterior communicating artery was poorly observed on the angiograms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Right middle cerebral artery branches were well visualized on vertebral angiograms at the late phase through the posterior and anterior pericallosal arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Due to this collateral blood supply, the right middle cerebral artery territory formed the most distal part of the cerebral circulation and was vulnerable to a reduction of cerebral blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We considered that systemic hemodynamic disturbances by identical mechanisms to those observed in cough <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> may have brought about <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">transient ischemia</z:e> in the right middle cerebral artery territory which was manifested in the patient's unusual clinical presentation of ICAO "cough <z:hpo ids='HP_0002301'>hemiplegia</z:hpo>" </plain></SENT>
