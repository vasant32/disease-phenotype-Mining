<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed 2714 patients undergoing 3092 primary CEAs (excluding combined procedures or redo CEA) at 11 hospitals in Northern New England from January 2003 through December 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hospitals varied in size (25 to 615 beds) and comprised community and teaching hospitals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifty surgeons reported results to the database </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Trained research personnel prospectively collected &gt;70 demographic and clinical variables for each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multivariate logistic regression models were used to generate odds ratios (ORs) and prediction models for the 30-day postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Across 3092 CEAs, there were 38 minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, 14 major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, and eight <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (5 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-related) &lt; or =30 days of the index procedure (30-day <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate, 1.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analyses, emergency CEA (OR, 7.0; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.8-26.9; P = .004), contralateral internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (OR, 2.8; 95% CI, 1.3-6.2; P = .009), preoperative ipsilateral cortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (OR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.1-5.1; P = .02), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> (OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.1-2.4, P = .03), and age &gt;70 (OR, 1.3; 95% CI, 0.8-2.3; P = .315) were associated with postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Preoperative antiplatelet therapy was protective (OR, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.2-0.9; P = .02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> varied from &lt;1% in patients with no risk factors to nearly 5% with patients with &gt; or =3 risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our risk prediction model had excellent correlation with observed results (r = 0.96) and reasonable discriminative ability (area under receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.71) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Risks varied from &lt;1% in asymptomatic patients with no risk factors to nearly 4% in patients with contralateral internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (OR, 3.2; 95% CI, 1.3-8.1; P = .01) and age &gt;70 (OR, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.0-4.9, P = .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Two hospitals performed significantly better than expected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These differences were not attributable to surgeon or hospital volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Surgeons can "risk-stratify" preoperative patients by considering the variables (emergency procedure, contralateral internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, preoperative ipsilateral cortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo>, and age), reducing risk with antiplatelet agents, and informing patients more precisely about their risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> after CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Risk prediction models can also be used to compare risk-adjusted outcomes between centers, identify best practices, and hopefully, improve overall results </plain></SENT>
