<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors created a complete unilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> model in 15 Sprague-Dawley rats, induced severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> for at least 36 minutes by exsanguination with the target mean arterial pressure being equal or less than 35 mmHg, and investigated the temporal and spatial evolution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> by diffusion-, T2-, and postcontrast T1-weighted magnetic resonance images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>Cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was detected in most regions of the right middle cerebral artery territory during exsanguination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was no significant relationship between ischemic lesion volume detected on apparent diffusion coefficient (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>) map (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> lesion volume) and infarction volume found on histopathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, there was a linear relationship between the change in <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> lesion volume at blood reinfusion (after reinfusion minus before reinfusion) and the enlargement of the lesion volume during the postreinfusion period (Y = 0.4X + 161.7, P = 0.0066) and a significant logarithmic correlation between the volume of vasogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> found on postcontrast T1-weighted image at 1 hour of the postreinfusion period and the enlargement of the lesion volume during the postreinfusion period (Y = 62.1 x logX - 115.4, P = 0.022) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, although it may be difficult to predict the outcome of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> (infarction volume) from the lesion volume during exsanguination, the evolution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> may be partly predicted by lesion volume changes seen on the <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> maps at the time of the blood reinfusion or by the severity of blood-brain barrier disruption at the early stage of the postreinfusion period </plain></SENT>
