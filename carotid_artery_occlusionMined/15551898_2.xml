<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using electroencephalography (EEG) or somatosensory evoked potential (SSEP) to monitor brain function and carefully positioning of the neck are recommended in these patients who are at risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> while receiving induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> during lumbar spine surgery in the prone position </plain></SENT>
