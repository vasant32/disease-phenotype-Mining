<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this work was to optimise conditions and explore the potential of using the anaesthetized guinea pig as an in vivo model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Guinea pigs were anaesthetized with Hypnorm/Hypnovel, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7983">pentobarbital</z:chebi> or fentanyl/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="7983">pentobarbital</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The electrocardiogram (ECG), heart rate, arterial blood pressure and indices of cardiac contractility were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In further experiments in fentanyl/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="7983">pentobarbital</z:chebi> anaesthetized guinea pigs the influence of bilateral versus unilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> on haemodynamic responses was investigated and the effects of inotropic drugs on left ventricular (LV) dP/dt(max) and the QA interval were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7983">Pentobarbital</z:chebi>, given alone or after fentanyl, provided suitable anaesthesia for these experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> did not alter heart rate or arterial blood pressure responses to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoprenaline</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">Isoprenaline</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7805">ouabain</z:chebi> increased LVdP/dt(max) and decreased the QA interval whereas <z:chebi fb="1" ids="9948">verapamil</z:chebi> had opposite effects and strong inverse correlations between LVdP/dt(max) and the QA interval were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Conditions can be optimised to allow the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7983">pentobarbital</z:chebi>-anaesthetized guinea pig to be used for simultaneous measurement of the effects of drugs on the ECG, haemodynamics and indices of cardiac contractility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The use of this small animal model in early pre-clinical safety pharmacology should contribute to improvements in detecting unwanted actions on the heart during the drug development process </plain></SENT>
