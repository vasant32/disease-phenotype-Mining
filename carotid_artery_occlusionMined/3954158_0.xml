<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CBF was measured by the hydrogen clearance technique and brain tissue metabolites such as <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> and ATP in the ischemic brain frozen in situ were determined by the enzymatic method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In comparison with saline-infused SHR, the reduction of CBF in the thalamus following carotid occlusion was significantly small in the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi> treated SHR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Supratentorial ATP concentration in the 3 hr-ischemic brain was reduced in both groups of rats, but its reduction was significantly smaller in the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi>-infused group than the other </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The present results strongly suggest that intravenous <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi> is effective against <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> from the view point of cerebral hemodynamic and metabolism </plain></SENT>
