<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Changes in blood flow velocity of the basal cerebral arteries are thought to correlate with changes of cerebral blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Changes in the diameter of the basal cerebral arteries, however, might influence the validity of transcranial Doppler measurements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eight patients with internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> who were undergoing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> testing for assessment of cerebrovascular vasomotor reactivity were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Blood flow velocities of both <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCAs</z:chebi> were measured with transcranial Doppler sonography before and 25 minutes after the administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Before and 15 minutes after the administration of medication, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging was performed contralateral to the occlusion side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A T2-weighted turbo-gradient spin-echo sequence was chosen to show a cross section of the M1 segment in high resolution (pixels, 0.27 x 0.29 mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Based on interpolated data, the smallest and greatest <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> diameters were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We did not find changes in the diameter of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> provocation testing with high-resolution <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging in patients with occlusive extracranial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results of our study support the hypothesis that changes in <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> flow velocity measured by transcranial Doppler sonography reflect relative changes in cerebral blood flow after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> provocation testing </plain></SENT>
