<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>GCI was induced by bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (BCAo) for 20 min followed by reperfusion for 9 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Postischemic continuous treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28179">benzamide</z:chebi> (160 mg/kg b w i.p. for 9 days) significantly reversed the GCI-induced anterograde <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairment</z:hpo> in passive avoidance step through and elevated plus maze tasks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The observed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairment</z:hpo> in vehicle treated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> group was found to be well correlated with DND and downregulation of cholinergic muscarinic receptor-1 expression, which was possibly mediated by <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, as revealed from inducible nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (iNOS) expression and number of TUNEL positive neurons in hippocampus CA1 region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is clear from the present experiment that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28179">benzamide</z:chebi> treatment significantly decreases the iNOS expression and number of apoptotic neurons and thereby improves the neuronal survival and memory during GCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our present findings provide compelling evidence that multiple doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28179">benzamide</z:chebi> treatment is a promising therapeutic approach for cerebrovascular and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegenerative diseases</z:hpo>, which deserves further clinical evaluation </plain></SENT>
