<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Post-ischaemic <z:chebi fb="13" ids="22720">benzodiazepine</z:chebi> administration is neuroprotective, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> administration of <z:chebi fb="13" ids="22720">benzodiazepines</z:chebi> can induce tolerance, such that the neuroprotective effect may be reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study investigated whether <z:chebi fb="13" ids="22720">benzodiazepine</z:chebi> tolerance can worsen ischaemic injury and whether neuroprotection by post-ischaemic <z:chebi fb="13" ids="22720">benzodiazepine</z:chebi> administration is affected by <z:chebi fb="13" ids="22720">benzodiazepine</z:chebi> tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also investigated whether antagonism of <z:chebi fb="13" ids="22720">benzodiazepine</z:chebi> receptors by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5103">flumazenil</z:chebi> was able to restore neuroprotection during <z:chebi fb="13" ids="22720">benzodiazepine</z:chebi> tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Experiments were performed in both <z:chebi fb="13" ids="22720">benzodiazepine</z:chebi>-tolerant and naive rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="13" ids="22720">Benzodiazepine</z:chebi> tolerance was indeed by 4 weeks administration of flurazepam </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (BCAO) was performed to cause <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four experiments were performed: (1) BCAO with no further interventions; (2) BCAO followed by administration of <z:chebi fb="11" ids="49575">diazepam</z:chebi>; (3) administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5103">flumazenil</z:chebi> before BAO; and (4) administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5103">flumazenil</z:chebi> before and <z:chebi fb="11" ids="49575">diazepam</z:chebi> after BCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neurological and histological assessment was performed 5 days after BCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:chebi fb="13" ids="22720">Benzodiazepine</z:chebi> tolerance did not affect neuronal injury in the CA1 and CA3 regions and dentate gyrus of the hippocampus after severe ischaemic insult, but did worsen neuronal damage when mild <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> was applied (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Neuroprotective efficacy of post-ischaemic <z:chebi fb="11" ids="49575">diazepam</z:chebi> was not observed under conditions of <z:chebi fb="13" ids="22720">benzodiazepine</z:chebi> tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="5103">Flumazenil</z:chebi> treatment before BCAO reduced ischaemic neuronal damage exacerbated by <z:chebi fb="13" ids="22720">benzodiazepine</z:chebi> tolerance (P&lt;0.05), and restored neuroprotection by post-ischaemic <z:chebi fb="11" ids="49575">diazepam</z:chebi> (P&lt;0.05), the effect of which was reduced by <z:chebi fb="13" ids="22720">benzodiazepine</z:chebi> tolerance (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, pre-ischaemic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5103">flumazenil</z:chebi> treatment in naive animals reduced neuroprotection provided by post-ischaemic <z:chebi fb="11" ids="49575">diazepam</z:chebi> (P&lt;0.01-0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="13" ids="22720">Benzodiazepine</z:chebi> tolerance can worsen ischaemic neuronal injury and abolish the neuroprotection provided by post-ischaemic <z:chebi fb="11" ids="49575">diazepam</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Pre-treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5103">flumazenil</z:chebi> treatment reversed <z:chebi fb="13" ids="22720">benzodiazepine</z:chebi> tolerance and restored neuroprotection by post-ischaemic <z:chebi fb="11" ids="49575">diazepam</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These findings may suggest that management of patient's risk of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> may need to take into account current use </plain></SENT>
