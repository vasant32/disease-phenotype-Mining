<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Pulsatile blood flow within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> carotid sinus involves at least two distinct components </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Beside the laminar antegrade flow, there is a boundary layer separation zone in the posterolateral aspect with transient flow reversal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This flow reversal is well known from in vitro studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is now possible to document these flow velocity components using color-coded Doppler sonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is hypothesized that if flow separation is detected, this is indicative of a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> condition of the carotid bifurcation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> develops, it involves preferentially the posterolateral bulb region, obliterating the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> configuration of the sinus with consequent loss of the flow separation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, loss of flow reversal should be indicative of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We have studied this flow pattern retrospectively in 156 patients (312 arteries) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 4 patients no flow reversal could be detected although no atheromatous lesions could be found at the bifurcation, but in these cases there was no bulb formation in the common carotid artery or in the internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, flow reversal was demonstrable in several pathological conditions within the carotid bifurcation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These included plaque formation after the bifurcation in 7 patients, internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> at the origin in 12, common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> despite a patent bifurcation in 4, and marked <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of the lumen forming a pseudobulb following disocclusion of the carotid artery in 11 patients </plain></SENT>
