<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Our study describes the <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>anatomy</z:mp> of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) in 65 Sprague-Dawley rats and the spatial distribution of ischemic cortical lesions caused by occluding major <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> branches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The rats characteristically had at least two major <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> branches, frontal and parietal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Many rats had additional branches supplying the pyriform and temporal cortexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Permanent occlusion of the frontal or parietal branches combined with 30 minutes of bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> produced visible Evans blue dye uptake by ischemic cortical areas after 24 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No lesions distal to the occlusion were apparent in 38% and 43% of rats with frontal and parietal branch occlusions, respectively; small lesions contiguous with the occlusion site were observed in 38% and 32% of the rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only 6% of the frontal and 7% of the parietal branch occlusions produced isolated distal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> as expected if these branches were end-arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Blood flow was reversed in arteries distal to the occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that extensive collateral connections of the frontal and parietal <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> branches with other arterial systems protect the anterior and posterior cortical regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, occlusions of the pyriform branch of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> invariably caused <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in the frontopyriform region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In about one third of the rats, frontal or parietal branch occlusions produced lesions involving much of the proximal <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory; the frontopyriform region was most consistently affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Combined, these data suggest that the pyriform <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> branch is an end-artery and that the cortical region it supplies is prone to ischemic damage resulting from any reduction of blood flow through the main <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> trunk.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
