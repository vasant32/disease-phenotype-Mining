<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The present study was designed to investigate the potential of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi>, a stretch-activated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="38215">calcium channel blocker</z:chebi> in ischemic reperfusion (I/R)-induced brain injury in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> of 12 min followed by reperfusion for 24 h was given to induce cerebral injury in male Swiss mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size was measured using triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Memory was assessed using <z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water maze</z:mp> test and motor <z:hpo ids='HP_0002311'>incoordination</z:hpo> was evaluated using rota-rod, lateral push, and inclined beam walking tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, total calcium, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33202">thiobarbituric acid</z:chebi> reactive substance (TBARS), reduced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> (GSH), and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity were also estimated in brain tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>I/R injury produced a significant increase in cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A significant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002622,C0751295" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction;Sign or Symptom" abbrv="">loss of memory</z:e> along with impairment of motor performance was also noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, I/R injury also produced a significant increase in levels of TBARS, total calcium, AChE activity, and a decrease in GSH levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi> significantly attenuated I/R-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size, behavioral and biochemical changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On the basis of the present findings, we can suggest that opening of stretch-activated calcium channel may play a critical role in ischemic reperfusion-induced brain injury and that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi> has neuroprotective potential in I/R-induced injury </plain></SENT>
