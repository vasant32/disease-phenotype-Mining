<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These experiments were conducted to examine the effects of oral administration of Scutellaria baicalensis extracts on the rescue of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairments</z:hpo> induced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1695782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral hypoperfusion</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi> (LPS) infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, the underlying mechanisms of these effects were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the first experiment, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1695782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral hypoperfusion</z:e> was induced in male Wister rats by bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (BCCAo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Daily administration of Scutellaria baicalensis extracts was started on 20 day after BCCAo and given for 40 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A <z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water maze</z:mp> was then used to evaluate the status of the hippocampal-dependent spatial learning and hippocampal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling was examined in control rats, rats with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1695782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral hypoperfusion</z:e>, and rats with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1695782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral hypoperfusion</z:e> that was administered Scutellaria baicalensis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the second experiment, hippocampal microglial activation was induced by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> infusions of LPS into the fourth ventricle of Fisher-344 rat brains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Daily administration of Scutellaria baicalensis extracts was started on 7 day after the surgery of LPS infusion and given for 32 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Spatial memory and hippocampal microglial activation was then examined in control rats with an artificial cerebrospinal fluid infusion, rats with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> LPS infusion, and rats with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> LPS infusion that were administered Scutellaria baicalensis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Rats that received <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1695782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral hypoperfusion</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> LPS infusion showed spatial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairments</z:hpo> relative to their control rats; however, these symptoms were reduced by daily administration of Scutellaria baicalensis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Administration of Scutellaria baicalensis mitigated alterations of hippocampal MAPK signaling by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> cerebral infusion and microglial activation by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> LPS infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that Scutellaria baicalensis may possess therapeutic potential for the prevention of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e> and vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
