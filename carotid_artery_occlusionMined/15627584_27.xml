<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We present a minimally invasive optical method, that is, multi-channel time-domain diffuse near-infrared reflectometry of the head to assess cerebral blood perfusion that is applicable at the bed-side and repetitively at short intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Following intravenous injection of an ICG bolus, its transit through intra- and extracerebral tissue is monitored based on changes in moments of distributions of times of flight of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photons</z:chebi>, recorded with a 4-channel instrument simultaneously on both hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In healthy volunteers, we found that variance of distributions of times of flight of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photons</z:chebi> is well suited to assess latency and initial slope of the increase in absorption of intracerebral tissue due to the bolus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We successfully applied our method in two patients demonstrating a reversible cerebral perfusion deficit in an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> patient who was treated by thrombolysis and in another patient with a permanent impaired unilateral perfusion due to ipsilateral internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In either case, we observed a difference in bolus transit time between the hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> patient, this difference resolved when re-evaluated 1 day after thrombolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The study demonstrates the necessity of a technique with sub-nanosecond time resolution to allow for depth discrimination if clinical perfusion monitoring of cerebrovascular diseases is addressed by optical methods </plain></SENT>
