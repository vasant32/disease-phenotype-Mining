<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A clinically observed inability to meet increased metabolic demand in the right hemisphere was concommitant to a decreased Pulsatility Index (PI) in the right middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Autoregulation studies showed almost <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of the resistance vessels in the right middle cerebral artery territory, at rest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A decreased blood flow velocity, in the right middle cerebral artery 7 months after the accident, suggesting a decreased rCBF, could not be confirmed by SPECT-rCBF studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This finding strongly cautions against interpretation of chronical blood flow velocity changes in terms of changes in regional blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The present study shows the benefits in the combined use of angiography, SPECT-rCBF, and TCD </plain></SENT>
