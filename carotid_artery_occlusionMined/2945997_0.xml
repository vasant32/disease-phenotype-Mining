<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The technique of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (<z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp>) that was introduced initially by Dotter and Judkins in 1964 has been applied to various arterial stenoses and some occlusive lesions and has advanced dramatically with the development of the Gr√ºntzig catheter in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>peripheral vascular disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the application to occlusive disease in brachiocephalic arteries is still considered to be disputable and has been made only in selective cases, especially in Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report here a case with stenosis of the left subclavian artery successfully treated with <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient was 66 year-old man, who had been suffering from transient attacks of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002321'>vertigo</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo>, visual disturbance and the left arm <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1456822" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">claudication</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Blood pressure was 150/92 mmHg in the right arm and 110 mmHg in systole in the left arm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Diagnostic arteriography identified the right carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> at its origin and significant stenosis in the proximal left subclavian artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> under fluoroscopic control was performed by passing dilating catheter in antegrade fashion by Seldinger method through the left femoral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Anatomic correction was achieved without hemorrhagic or embolic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Systolic blood pressure gradient measured at the brachial artery level disappeared immediately after <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> and symptomatic relief was obtained completely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One month later, wide patency of the left subclavian artery and sufficient antegrade flow in the vertebral artery were confirmed angiographically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>During follow-up period of 4 months, the patient was asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We reviewed the literature reporting <z:mp ids='MP_0002633'>PTA</z:mp> for occlusive disease in brachiocephalic arteries and discussed its problems and possibilities, especially for the treatment of subclavian <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
