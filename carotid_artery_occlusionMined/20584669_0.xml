<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of Shengmaisan on the learning and memory abilities and the expression of nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase and neuron <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in the hippocampus of rats with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> (VD), and explore the mechanism of Shengmaisan for treatment of VD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Wistar rats were divided randomly in to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control group, sham-operated group, VD model group, high-dose Shengmaisan group, low-dose Shengmaisan group, and nimodipine group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the latter 4 groups, bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (BCCAO) was performed to establish rat models of VD followed by intragastric administration of Shengmaisan at 10 or 30 g.kg(-1).day(-1) or nimodipine at 20 g.kg(-1).day(-1) accordingly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The rats in the control, sham-operated and model groups were given saline in the same manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The improvement of learning and memory abilities of the rats was assessed using <z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water maze</z:mp> test, and NOS activity and neuronal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in the hippocampus were determined after the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The learning and memory ability and hippocampal NOS activity and neuronal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in low-dose Shengmaisan group and nimodipine group were significantly different from those in the VD model group (P&lt;0.01), but no significant differences were found between high-dose Shengmaisan group and nimodipine group (P&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Shengmaisan can significantly improve the learning and memory abilities of VD rats but may not be able to totally reverse the damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The therapeutic effect of Shengmaisan might be related to its effect in decreasing NOS activity and inhibiting neuronal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in the hippocampus </plain></SENT>
