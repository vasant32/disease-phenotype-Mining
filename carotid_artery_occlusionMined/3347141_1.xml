<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During BLCO (3 min), AO systolic pressure (AP) increased along with significant increases in ADR-CA output, renal venous (RV) CA output, as well as in AO-E and NE concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A ratio of NE:E in ADR venous and AO blood did not exceed 0.42 +/- 0.09 and 1.09 +/- 0.24 upon BLCO, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the NE:E ratio in RV blood increased significantly from 5.39 +/- 0.91 to 9.78 +/- 1.31 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Following adrenalectomy (ADRX), the increase in AO-NE in response to BLCO was significantly attenuated by approximately 56%, but the increase in RV-NE output was not affected by ADRX </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results show that in vagotomized dogs, NE is co-released with E from the adrenal glands upon BLCO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The data also indicate that the increase in AO-NE concentration was dependent to a similar extent on the simultaneous increases in ADR-NE output and neuronal NE release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that under conditions where the sympathoadrenal system is activated, circulating plasma NE concentration may be significantly affected by an increase in ADR-NE output </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sympathetic neuronal contributions would, thereby, be overestimated in assessing overall sympathetic nerve activity by measuring circulating NE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>NE concentrations in local venous effluent from individual organs may be more reliable estimates of the sympathetic nerve activity </plain></SENT>
