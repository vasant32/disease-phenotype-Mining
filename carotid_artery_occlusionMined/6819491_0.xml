<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>TRH immediately post-occlusion, compared to saline controls, significantly increased mortality (P = 0.025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This was supported by worsening reflected in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> index and time to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thyrotropin (0.1 IU, i.p.) in the same model was without effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These surprising results were unexpected due to the beneficial response to the pharmacologically related <z:chebi fb="1" ids="7459">naloxone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
