<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Motor activation single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomographic (SPECT) images were obtained for nine patients who had undergone superficial temporal artery to middle cerebral artery anastomosis for symptomatic internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> motor activation SPECT images using the finger opposition task on the affected side were obtained before bypass surgery and at 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months after bypass surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results of motor activation single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography were expressed as negative or positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Before bypass surgery, the resting SPECT images revealed reduction of cerebral blood flow (CBF) on the affected side in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> nine patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results of motor activation single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography in three patients were positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One week after bypass surgery, the results of the resting and motor activation CBF studies did not demonstrate any marked changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One month after bypass surgery, the resting CBF increased in four patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results obtained for two of the patients revealed preoperative positive motor activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results of motor activation single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography obtained for five patients were positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Three months after bypass surgery, eight patients experienced improvement in the resting CBF, and the results of motor activation single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography obtained for seven patients were positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Among these, the results of preoperative motor activation single <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission tomography obtained for four patients were negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Superficial temporal artery to middle cerebral artery bypass is useful not only for resting CBF but also for pure motor function based on motor activation SPECT images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>From the preoperative motor activation study, it was concluded that patients with preoperative positive motor activation could attain the effect of bypass earlier than patients with preoperative negative motor activation </plain></SENT>
