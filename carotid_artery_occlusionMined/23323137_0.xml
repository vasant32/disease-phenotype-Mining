<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: White-matter (WM) lesions are known to potentiate <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> in poststroke patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was designed to assess whether Ginkgo biloba extract (GB) and cilostazol, which were evaluated alone and in a combination formula (Renexin), can attenuate the WM lesions and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001268'>cognitive decline</z:hpo> caused by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> hypoperfusion in the rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: ANIMALS WERE DIVIDED INTO FIVE TREATMENT GROUPS: cilostazol (25 mg/kg/day), GB (20 mg/kg/day), Renexin (25 mg/kg/day cilostazol + 20 mg/kg/day GB), vehicle, and sham </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The animals received the treatments orally 1 day after bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> [two-vessel occlusion (2VO); except for the sham group, which underwent the surgery but the arteries were not occluded], and then the same dose every day for 21 days thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Prior to sacrificing the rats, repetitive eight-arm radial maze testing was performed to examine their cognitive abilities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After drug administration and cognitive testing, brain tissues were isolated for Kl√ºver-Barrera and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi> nick end-labeling (TUNEL) staining, immunohistochemical assessment of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and CD11b (OX-42), and to assay <z:chebi fb="19" ids="26519">free-radical</z:chebi> scavenging activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found that the significant WM lesions induced by 2VO was ameliorated significantly by treatment with cilostazol, GB, and Renexin, in association with increased TUNEL-positive cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1695782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral hypoperfusion</z:e> caused a large increase in the degree of GFAP and OX-42 immunoreactivity and <z:chebi fb="19" ids="26519">free-radical</z:chebi> activity in the optic tract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These abnormalities were significantly reversed by the three drugs, but most prominently by Renexin, suggesting a markedly enhanced or supra-additive effect of cilostazol and GB when administered together </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Significant attenuation of cytoarchitectural damage and apoptotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was found with GB and cilostazol, but a markedly enhanced effect was seen for treatment with their combination in the WM of rat brains after bilateral occlusion of the common carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We suggest that combination therapy with GB and cilostazol provides enhanced neuroprotective effects and induces subsequent cognitive improvement in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> ischemic conditions </plain></SENT>
