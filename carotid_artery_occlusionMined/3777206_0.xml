<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The effect of mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001941'>acidosis</z:hpo> on the reduction in liver vascular volume provoked by reflex sympathetic activation was ascertained in dogs by use of the multiple indicator-dilution technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Portal vein-hepatic vein dilution patterns were obtained following injection of a mixture containing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50076">51Cr</z:chebi>-labeled red blood cells (a vascular reference), <z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>-labeled <z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi> (an interstitial reference), and 3H-labeled water (a cellular reference) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Liver vascular, interstitial, and cellular water spaces were measured in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and mildly acidotic dogs under basal conditions and during bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Carotid occlusion resulted in a large increase in arterial blood pressure in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and a lesser increase in acidotic dogs, but the increase in portal and hepatic vein <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18357,33569">norepinephrine</z:chebi> and decrease in liver vascular and interstitial volumes observed in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> dogs did not occur in the acidotic animals; no change in labeled water accessible liver cellular spaces was perceptible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The data indicate that mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001941'>acidosis</z:hpo> abolishes the ordinarily expected reduction in liver vascular volumes on sympathetic activation in the intact dog but not the arterial pressor response </plain></SENT>
