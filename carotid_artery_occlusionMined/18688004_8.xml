<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Institutional Review Board approval and informed consent were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty functionally independent patients (24 men, 6 women; mean age, 63 years) with an angiographically proven unilateral internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and transient or minor disabling ischemic attacks ipsilateral to the side of the internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Grading of ECA collateral flow was performed with intraarterial digital subtraction angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The contribution of the ECA to regional cerebral blood flow was assessed with selective arterial spin labeling MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Differences in regional cerebral blood flow were analyzed with Student t test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty percent of the patients had ECA Grade 0 collateral flow (no filling of ophthalmic artery), 20% Grade 1 (filling of carotid siphon), and 60% Grade 2 (filling of anterior and/or middle cerebral artery) as demonstrated on digital subtraction angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although in the Grade 1 group, the ECA supplied a smaller region of the brain compared with the Grade 2 group, the mean regional cerebral blood flow of the perfusion territory supplied by the ECA is similar (P=0.70) in the Grade 1 group (mean+/-SD 57+/-16 mL/min/100 g) and the Grade 2 group (60+/-12 mL/min/100g) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with symptomatic internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, focal brain regions may strongly depend on the contribution to cerebral perfusion of the ECA ipsilateral to the side of the internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, even in patients with limited ECA collateral supply as demonstrated on digital subtraction angiography </plain></SENT>
