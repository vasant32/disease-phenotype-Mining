<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> these stimuli <z:mp ids='MP_0005333'>reduced heart rate</z:mp> (except carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, which induced approximately equal number of tachi- and bradycardic responses) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The former three stimuli also reduced atrioventricular (AV) conduction velocity, the changes in these two parameters were proportional </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Changes in heart rate induced by Aschner maneuver were more pronounced than changes in AV conduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Stimulation of depressor induced co-directed shifts in these parameters during the first seconds, but then AV conduction increased, while heart rate remained decreased; <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> and AV acceleration persisted for long time after termination of stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our findings attest to independent regulation of heart rate and AV conduction velocity and to the absence of a strict relationship between these two parameters </plain></SENT>
