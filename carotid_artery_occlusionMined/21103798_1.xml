<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Presently, no medication has been registered as a neuroprotector </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neuroprotection with intranasal Neuro-EPO (EPO, erythropoietin) has emerged as a multifunctional therapy that plays a significant role in neural survival and functional recovery in an animal model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, there is limited access to the brain through the blood brain barrier (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33602">BBB</z:chebi>) for intravenously applied EPO, and the high EPO dosages needed to obtain a protective effect increase the danger of elevated hematocrit levels and practically exclude <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> or subchronic treatment with EPO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A promising approach has been recently developed with a nonerythropoietic variant of EPO, Neuro-EPO, with low <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26667">sialic acid</z:chebi> content, a very short plasma half-life, and without erythropoietic activity, probably similar to endogenous brain EPO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The objective of this work was to determine the neuroprotective effect of intranasal Neuro-EPO in comparison with the human recombinant EPO injected intraperitoneally in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, employing the common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> model in gerbils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neuro-EPO has demonstrated a better neuroprotective effect, evidenced through increased viability, improvements of the neurological state and cognitive functions, as well as protection of the CA3 region of the hippocampus, temporal cortex, and the thalamus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the intranasal application of Neuro-EPO has a better neuroprotective effect than intraperitoneal EPO, evidenced by the significant improvement of neurological, cognitive, and histological status in the animal model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> employed </plain></SENT>
