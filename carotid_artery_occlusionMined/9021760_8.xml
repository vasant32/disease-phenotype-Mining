<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The steal ratio, calculated as the ratio of %control CBF to %control CeBF, was 1.02 +/- 0.06 (mean +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) at 60 minutes of BCO in adult rats that exhibited <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels of brain metabolites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By contrast, the ratios significantly decreased to 0.74 +/- 0.06 in suckling rats and 0.69 +/- 0.06 in aged rats with simultaneous increases by 2.4 to 2.9-fold of tissue <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ischemic derangement of the brain metabolism is in part related to poor blood supply from the posterior circulation in suckling and aged rats </plain></SENT>
