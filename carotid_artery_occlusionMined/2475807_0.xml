<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Case 1, a 71-year-old female, was hospitalized in a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Angiography demonstrated occlusion of the bilateral ICA, collateral blood supply through the branches of the foramen rotundum or vidian artery from the maxillary arteries and right posterior communicating artery, and a saccular <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> at the basilar bifurcation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient died 1 month later following rerupture of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Case 2, a 64-year-old male, was hospitalized for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002329'>drowsiness</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Angiography showed occlusion of the right ICA, collateral blood supply through a tortuous artery (a vidian artery), and a large <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> at the basilar bifurcation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Posterior circulation supplied anteriorly through the right posterior communicating artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patient died 1 month later because of rerupture of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Laminar <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the right ICA and an anastomotic vessel, seemingly a branch of the foramen rotundum or a vidian artery, were demonstrated by autopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The combination of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysm</z:hpo> and collateral circulation is extremely rare in cases of occlusion of the ICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The two cases described here suggest that hemodynamic stress is an important factor in the formation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
