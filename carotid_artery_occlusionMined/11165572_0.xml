<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Glandular blood flow and mean blood pressure were monitored before, during and after carotid occlusion in the presence and absence of the nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase inhibitor N(omega)-<z:chebi fb="13" ids="29785">nitro</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16467,29952">L-arginine</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">ester</z:chebi> (L-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NAME</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To calculate vascular resistance, the local perfusion pressure distal to the point of occlusion was also measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rats, uni- or bilateral carotid occlusion resulted in an immediate decrease in ipsilateral glandular blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After the cessation of carotid occlusion, hyperaemia was observed in the submandibular gland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both local perfusion pressure and vascular resistance decreased during carotid occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the group pretreated with L-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NAME</z:e>, trends in blood-flow responses to uni- or bilateral occlusion were identical to those registered in the control groups, though the magnitude of the alterations was significantly less </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The well-maintained glandular blood flow was due to functioning vascular anastomoses and compensating <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of glandular blood vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> had only a restrained effect on this compensatory mechanism </plain></SENT>
