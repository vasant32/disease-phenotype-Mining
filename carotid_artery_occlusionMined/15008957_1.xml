<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effect of bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (BCCAO) on cardiovascular responses and nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> (NO) formation in the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three adult cats were anaesthetized intraperitoneally with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="17967">urethane</z:chebi> (400 mg/kg) and alpha-chloralose (40 mg/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The femoral artery was cannulated to allow monitoring of systemic arterial pressure (SAP) and heart rate (HR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The femoral vein was cannulated for intravenous drug administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Extracellular NO levels in the NTS were measured by in vivo voltammetry using an NO microsensor combined with a microcomputer-controlled apparatus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Microinjection of l-arginine (30 nmol) into the NTS produced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> and NO release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This effect of l-arginine was not changed by 2 min of BCCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> produced increases in SAP and NO levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These effects were more apparent in vagotomized than in intact animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> latency of BCCAO-induced changes in SAP levels (8.4 +/- 2.5 s) was longer than that for changes in NO (4.7 +/- 1.7 s) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> and NO release in the NTS of intact and vagotomized animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>These cardiovascular and NO responses to BCCAO were significantly attenuated by NG-<z:chebi fb="13" ids="29785">nitro</z:chebi>-l-arginine <z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">ester</z:chebi> (10 mg/kg, i.v.) and MK-801 (2.5 mg/kg, i.v.) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that NO synthase and activation of N-<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-d-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi> receptors are involved in the cardiovascular and NO responses to BCCAO </plain></SENT>
