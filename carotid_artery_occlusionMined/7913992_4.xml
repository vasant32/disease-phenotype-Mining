<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Haemodynamic insufficiency is characterized by a severely reduced cerebrovascular reserve capacity, measured with Xe-133 D-SPECT and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> challenge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Preoperatively, the mean baseline cerebral blood flow of 54 +/- 6 ml 100 g-1 min-1 did not change after challenge (54 +/- 5 ml 100 g-1 min-1) in the symptomatic hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immediately following surgery an improvement in cerebrovascular reserve capacity for up to 14 +/- 8 ml 100 g-1 min-1 (1-2 years control) was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One patient subsequently died from a perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, another patient died three months post-operatively from a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three patients were followed up to 4 years, four for 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with former <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tia|TIA|T.I.A.">transient ischaemic attacks</z:e> had no further attacks, symptoms from PRIND or minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> did not progress further, nor did new symptoms occur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Unilateral extracranial-intracranial bypass surgery has a positive effect on clinical outcome in highly selected patients with bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> of haemodynamic origin </plain></SENT>
