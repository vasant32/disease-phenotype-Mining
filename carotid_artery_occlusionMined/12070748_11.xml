<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A transient (lasting for 15 min) bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> model was created by using male Mongolian gerbils ( n=20, weight 50-60 g) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The animals were divided into a group with mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> (34 degrees C, n=10) and a normothermic group (37 degrees C, n=10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>High-energy phosphate metabolism (ATP, PCr, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Pi</z:e>) and intracellular pH were sequentially measured using (31)P-MRS during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and after reperfusion for 1 week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The same animals were also subjected to a histopathological evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups in the quantities of the metabolites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, after reperfusion the rate of metabolic recovery by the mildly hypothermic (MH) group was significantly higher (by 10-20%) than the normothermic (NT) group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The intracellular pH decreased about 0.4 in both groups after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>; and after reperfusion the intracellular pH of the MH group returned to baseline levels faster than in the NT group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One week after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, energy metabolism gradually decreased about 10-20% in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the histopathological evaluation, pyramidal cell damage in the hippocampus was 33% on average in the MH group and 79% in the NT group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The neuronal damage to the cerebral cortex was 26% in the MH group and 61% in the NT group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Astrocyte reactivity in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex was 2.9% and 1.1% in the MH group and 9.7% and 5.2% in the NT group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The results of this experiment indicate that the protective effect of mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> is due to the high recovery rate of ATP and PCr and the prevention of a secondary decline in high phosphate energy </plain></SENT>
