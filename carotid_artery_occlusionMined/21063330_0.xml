<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This experimental study took place in the Animal Research Laboratory at Dokuz Eylul University, Izmir, Turkey in the year 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fifty rats were subjected to cerebral I/R induced by right carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> technique for a duration of 45 minutes, and then were treated with EGb761 (50 mg/kg/day, ip) and Se (0.625 mg/kg, ip), alone or in combination for 14 days after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="18421">Superoxide</z:chebi> dismutase, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> peroxidase activities were measured in the hippocampal tissues from 25 animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Histopathological examinations were also carried out under light and electron microscopy from the rest of animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The results suggest that EGb761 has a potent neuroprotective effect against cerebral I/R induced injury in rat brain that is comparable with that of Se </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the combined use of EGb761 and Se does not further protect from neuronal injury when compared with the use of both agents alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Our results suggest that administration of EGb761, Se and its combination with EGb761 have significant neuroprotective effects on I/R injury in rats via suppression of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
