<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An experience with the operative treatment of recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0741975" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid disease</z:e> to document the risks and benefits of this procedure is presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A review of a prospectively acquired vascular registry over a 10-year period (Jan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>1990-Jan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>2000) was undertaken to identify patients undergoing repeat carotid surgery following previous carotid endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were treated with repeat carotid endarterectomy, carotid interposition graft, or subclavian-carotid bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate, operative complications, life-table freedom from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, and rates of recurrent stenosis were documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During the study period 56 patients underwent repeat carotid surgery, comprising 6% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> carotid operations during this period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The indication for operation was symptomatic disease recurrence in 41 cases (73%) and asymptomatic recurrent stenosis &gt;/=80% in 15 cases (27%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The average interval from the prior carotid endarterectomy to the repeat operation was 78 months (range 3 weeks-297 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The operations performed included repeat carotid endarterectomy with patch angioplasty in 31 cases (55%), interposition grafts in 19 cases (34%), and subclavian-carotid bypass in 6 cases (11%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were three perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> with one resulting in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> for a perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate of 5.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>One minor transient cranial nerve (CN IX) injury occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up was 29 months (range, 1-116 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Life-table freedom from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was 95% at 1 year and 90% at 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Recurrent stenosis (&gt;/=80%) developed in three patients (5.4%) during follow-up, including one internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Two patients (3.6%) underwent repeat surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Repeat surgery for recurrent cerebrovascular disease following carotid endarterectomy is safe and provides durable freedom from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Most patients are candidates for repeat endarterectomy with patching, but interposition grafting is often required </plain></SENT>
