<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Based on Hossmann's observation of postischemic "delayed hypoperfusion," we hypothesized that capillary flow is decreased during reperfusion because of increased precapillary flow resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To test this hypothesis, we measured cerebral capillary erythrocyte velocity and diameter changes by intravital microscopy in gerbils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A cranial window was prepared over the frontoparietal cortex in 26 gerbils anesthetized with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The animals underwent either a sham operation or fifteen minutes of bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> causing global <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Capillary flow velocities were measured by frame-to-frame tracking of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">fluorescein isothiocyanate</z:chebi> labeled erythrocytes in 1800 capillaries after 1-hour reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Capillary flow velocities were decreased compared to control (0.25 +/- 0.27 mm/s vs. 0.76 +/- 0.45 mm/s; P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Precapillary arteriole diameters in reperfused animals were reduced to 76.3 +/- 6.9% compared to baseline (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Capillary diameters in reperfused animals (2.87 +/- 0.97 microm) were reduced (P&lt;0.001) compared to control (4.08 +/- 1.19 microm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Similar reductions of precapillary (24%) and capillary vessel diameters (30%) and absolute capillary flow <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> indicate that delayed (capillary) hypoperfusion occurs as a consequence of increased precapillary arteriole tone during reperfusion </plain></SENT>
