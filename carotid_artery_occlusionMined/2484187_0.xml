<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>During the period of recirculation following transient global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, an initial hyperemia is succeeded by a secondary decrease in cerebral blood flow, termed "delayed postischemic hypoperfusion." It has been suggested that this phenomenon can lead to additional brain damage after the initial ischemic insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One proposed mechanism of delayed postischemic hypoperfusion is increased cerebrovascular smooth muscle tone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Release of vasoactive <z:chebi fb="39" ids="32952">amines</z:chebi>, formation of vasoactive products of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi> metabolism, and disturbance of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39124">calcium ion</z:chebi> homeostasis in cerebrovascular smooth muscle may contribute to postischemic vasoconstriction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="25375">monoamine</z:chebi> metabolism following transient global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was investigate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mongolian gerbils subjected to 15 minutes of temporal bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and up to 6 hours of recirculation were employed as a model of transient global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this model, secondary energy failure reportedly occurs after 6 hours of recirculation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Regional cerebral concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25375">monoamines</z:chebi> and their metabolites were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After 4 to 6 hours of recirculation, accumulation of vasoactive <z:chebi fb="39" ids="32952">amine</z:chebi>, 5-hydroxytryptamine, its major metabolite, 5-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="24702">hydroxyindole</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="22" ids="15366">acetic acid</z:chebi>, and its precursor amino acid, tryptophan were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This finding strongly suggests a postischemic increase in both synthesis and release of this <z:chebi fb="39" ids="32952">amine</z:chebi>, which may explain postischemic vasoconstriction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, increased <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> synthesis and release after 1 hour of recirculation was suggested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>As <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> release is reported to increase cerebral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> utilization, its elevation may contribute to an increase in cerebral energy demand after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus, the brain becomes relatively ischemic and secondary ischemic cell damage occurs </plain></SENT>
