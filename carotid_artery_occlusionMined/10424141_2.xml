<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: In internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, patients with inadequate blood supply relative to metabolic demand (misery perfusion) may be at increased risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study investigated whether patients demonstrating misery perfusion on <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography (PET) have a high risk of subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in symptomatic internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We prospectively evaluated the relationship between the regional hemodynamic status of cerebral circulation and the subsequent risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in 40 patients with symptomatic internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> who underwent PET </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into two hemodynamic categories according to the mean hemispheric value of oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) in the hemisphere supplied by the artery with symptomatic disease: patients with increased OEF and those with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> OEF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were followed with medical treatment until the recurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> for 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The three-year incidence of ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo> for patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> OEF and those with increased OEF were 1 of 34 and 3 of 6 patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A significantly higher incidence of ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> was found in patients with increased OEF (Kaplan-Meier analysis and log-rank test; p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis with the Cox proportional hazards model demonstrated that increased OEF significantly increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> recurrence: the relative risk was 19.5 (95% CI, 2.0-188.6) for ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An increase in the absolute OEF value was a better predictor of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> than an OEF asymmetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that patients with symptomatic internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and misery perfusion have a high risk for subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, identification and optimal treatment of patients with misery perfusion may be essential in preventing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
