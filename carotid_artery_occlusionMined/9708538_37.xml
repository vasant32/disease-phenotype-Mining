<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Collateral flow via the ACoA and PCoA was determined with magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and collateral flow via the OphA with transcranial Doppler (TCD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Volume flow was studied with MRA, metabolism with 1H <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> spectroscopy, <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> reactivity with TCD, and the incidence of border zone <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> with MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Compared with controls, patients had deteriorated volume flow, metabolism, and <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> reactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No differences were found between patients with and patients without collateral flow through the ACoA and/or PCoA, or between patients with or without collateral flow via the OphA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients without collateral flow via any of these collaterals had decreased volume flow in the middle cerebral artery, decreased N-acetylaspartate/<z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi>, and increased <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi>/N-acetylaspartate, compared with the other patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with symptomatic internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> have deteriorated cerebral hemodynamics and metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Different collateral flow patterns via the ACoA, PCoA, or OphA have no effect on the hemodynamic and metabolic parameters, as long as one of these pathways is present </plain></SENT>
