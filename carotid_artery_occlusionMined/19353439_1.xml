<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Improved haemodynamics in the middle cerebral arteries (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCAs</z:chebi>) after carotid artery endaterectomy (CEA) has been demonstrated in a number of studies, whereas similar analyses on carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS) remain insignificant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the study was to test whether CAS affects haemodynamic parameters of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> ipsilaterally and contralaterally to the side of the procedure in patients with symptomatic internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis, assessed by transcranial Doppler (TCD) examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Carotid angioplasty and stenting was performed in 51 patients (39 men and 12 women) aged 45-86 (mean age: men 65.5 years, women 69 years) after first ever ischaemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided into three groups: with CAS of the left stenotic ICA - group I, with CAS of the right stenotic ICA - group II and group III with CAS of the left stenotic ICA and right ICA occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Increase of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCAs</z:chebi> flow after CAS was recorded both in ipsilateral <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCAs</z:chebi> and contralateral <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCAs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although an increase of <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCAs</z:chebi> flow was observed, it was not significant in either <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCAs</z:chebi> of group I and II patients, or in ipsilateral <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCAs</z:chebi> of individuals in group III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An evident increase of blood flow after CAS occurred in cMCAs of group III individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similar results were received with reference to Gosling's pulsatility index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Carotid angioplasty and stenting improves blood flow in both the ipsilateral and contralateral middle cerebral artery in patients with symptomatic carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Carotid angioplasty and stenting seems to be more effective in patients with symptomatic carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> combined with contralateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> than in individuals with symptomatic carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> alone </plain></SENT>
