<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we produced a rat model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1695782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral hypoperfusion</z:e> (CCH) by permanent bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> to investigate markers of iron and <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> associated with it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found CCH led to significant spatial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairment</z:hpo> in the <z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water maze</z:mp> at 4Â months after bilateral ligation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_41'>Iron deposition</z:mpath> was observed in both the hippocampal CA1 area and cerebral cortex, and was correlated with localized neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and increased <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Western blotting revealed that the expression levels of ferritin heavy chain and the transferrin receptor were significantly elevated in hippocampus and cortex after CCH, whereas expression of iron regulatory protein 1 was significantly lower than in sham-treated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that localized <z:hpo ids='HP_0002180'>neurodegeneration</z:hpo> and concomitant <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairments</z:hpo> following CCH may result, at least in part, from local disruption of neuronal iron metabolism </plain></SENT>
