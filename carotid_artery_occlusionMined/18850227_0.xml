<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined whether <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> deficiency affects platelet endothelial cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule-1 (PECAM-1), which is an immunoglobulin-associated cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule and mediates the final common pathway of neutrophil transendothelial migration, in blood vessels in the gerbil dentate gyrus after transient forebrain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Gerbils were exposed to a <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi>-deficient diet (<z:chebi fb="18" ids="16238">FAD</z:chebi>) for 3 months and then subjected to common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> for 5 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the control diet (CD)- and <z:chebi fb="18" ids="16238">FAD</z:chebi>-treated sham-operated groups, weak PECAM-1 immunoreactivity was detected in the blood vessels located in the dentate gyrus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PECAM-1 immunoreactivity in both groups was increased by 4 days after ischemic insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PECAM-1 immunoreactivity in the <z:chebi fb="18" ids="16238">FAD</z:chebi>-treated group was twice as high that in the CD-treated-sham-operated group 4 days after ischemic insult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Western blot analyses showed that the change patterns in PECAM-1 protein levels in the dentate gyrus in both groups after ischemic insult were similar to changes in PECAM-1 immunohistochemistry in the ischemic dentate gyrus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> deficiency enhances PECAM-1 in the dentate gyrus induced by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">transient ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
