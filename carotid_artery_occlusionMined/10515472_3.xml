<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To compare the clinical outcomes for patients with carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> with advanced age, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, atherosclerotic coronary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e>, and contralateral internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> who underwent carotid endarterectomy (CEA), using regional anesthesia, with the outcomes for patients without these risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A prospective series of 600 CEAs performed using regional anesthesia was analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were surgically treated under the direction of one neurosurgeon, in an academic medical center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical outcome measures were any <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, or cardiac morbidity within 30 days after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were monitored until a clinical end point was reached and/or 6 weeks had elapsed after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The incidence of adverse clinical outcomes among the suspected high-risk patients was compared with the incidence for the entire series using contingency-table analysis (chi2 and Fisher's exact tests) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifteen <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> (2.5%), three cardiac complications (0.5%), and two <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (0.3%) occurred within 30 days after CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>None of the suspected risk factors was associated with a significantly (P &lt; 0.05) increased risk of perioperative morbidity or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CEA using regional anesthesia can be performed for patients with advanced age, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo>, atherosclerotic coronary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e>, and contralateral internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, with acceptably low perioperative morbidity rates </plain></SENT>
