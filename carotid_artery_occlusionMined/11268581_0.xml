<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the phenomenon was unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined regional cerebral blood flow(rCBF) before, during and after subsequent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in the development of the adaptation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Male Wistar rats(n = 18) were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Unilateral(right) carotid artery ligation was performed 3 hours(group A: n = 8), 3 days(group B: n = 10) before forebrain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>arteries occlusion</z:mp>, mean arterial blood pressure(MABP) was reduced by hypobaric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> down to 50 mmHg and maintained constant for 30 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo>, the experiment continued for 90 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Local CBF were registered at 25(5 x 5) identical locations by laser Doppler scanning in the cortex during the experiment in bilateral hemispheres(at control phase, after the left carotid artery ligation, during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The physiological variable such as blood pressure and gas analysis were within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no differences of rCBF between the right and left hemispheres in group A during the experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In group A, rCBF of both hemispheres significantly decreased after the ligation of the left carotid artery, during the induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (P &lt; 0.05), and recovered to the value of before <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Whereas, in group B rCBF of the left side(non-occluded side) decreased after the ligation of the left carotid artery, during the induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>(P &lt; 0.05), and recovered to the value of before <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, but rCBF of the right side(occluded side) decreased only during the induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>(P &lt; 0.05) and rCBF of the right side was significantly higher than the left brain after ligation of the carotid artery, during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and after <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo>(P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>On the basis of these data, we concluded that cerebrovascular adaptations can be acquired by 3 days after unilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and the tolerance phenomenon is certainly attributed to microcirculatory improvement </plain></SENT>
