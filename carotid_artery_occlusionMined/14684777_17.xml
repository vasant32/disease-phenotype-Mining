<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cerebral hemodynamic and metabolic changes can compensate for the decrease in cerebral blood flow occurring in patients with carotid occlusive disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At present, a complete assessment of the cerebral adaptive status is only possible with <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi>-emission tomography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a noninvasive technique that, providing a real time assessment of fluctuations in cerebral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>, has been used to estimate the cerebral blood volume and to measure cerebral vasomotor reactivity (VMR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, NIRS technology, by allowing the absolute measurement of absorption and scattering coefficients of brain, can determine the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5656">deoxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> concentrations in situ in the blood stream </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In order to evaluate different aspects of the cerebral hemodynamic status, 27 subjects with symptomatic and asymptomatic carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and 30 healthy subjects underwent a simultaneous examination by means of transcranial Doppler (TCD), able to reliably detect collateral circulation and VMR, and NIRS at rest condition and during <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> reactivity test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The main finding of this study was the demonstration of a difference between asymptomatic and symptomatic patients in terms of mean flow velocity increase (52.4% versus 21.0%; P&lt;0.001) estimated by TCD and of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> saturation increase measured by NIRS (6.8% versus 3.8%; P=0.015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The opportunity to perform NIRS and TCD simultaneously provides useful information about both hemodynamic and metabolic cerebral adaptive status in patients with occlusive disease in a simple, noninvasive, and reliable way </plain></SENT>
