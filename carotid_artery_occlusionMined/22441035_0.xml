<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we compared the long-term effects of intravenous administration of HUCBC at three different doses on spatial memory and brain morphological changes after HI in newborn Wistar rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, we tested whether the transplanted HUCBC migrate to the injured brain after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seven-day-old animals underwent right carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and were exposed to 8% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi> inhalation for 2 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 24 h, randomly selected animals were assigned to four different experimental groups: HI rats administered with vehicle (HI+vehicle), HI rats treated with 1×10(6) (HI+low-dose), 1×10(7) (HI+medium-dose), and 1×10(8) (HI+high-dose) HUCBC into the jugular vein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A control group (sham-operated) was also included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After 8 weeks of transplantation, spatial memory performance was assessed using the <z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water maze</z:mp> (MWM), and subsequently, the animals were euthanized for brain morphological analysis using stereological methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, we performed immunofluorescence and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analyses to identify HUCBC in the rat brain 7 days after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The MWM test showed a significant spatial memory recovery at the highest HUCBC dose compared with HI+vehicle rats (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the brain <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> was also significantly lower in the HI+medium- and high-dose groups compared with the HI+vehicle animals (P&lt;0.01; 0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, HUCBC were demonstrated to be localized in host brains by immunohistochemistry and PCR analyses 7 days after intravenous administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results revealed that HUCBC transplantation has the dose-dependent potential to promote robust tissue repair and stable cognitive improvement after HI brain injury </plain></SENT>
