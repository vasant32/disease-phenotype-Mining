<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To clarify the mechanisms of blood flow restoration after major <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, we presented first dynamic changes in cortical vessel <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> observed through a cranial window in mice after unilateral common carotid artery (CCA) occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The density and diameter of capillaries, as well as diameters of pial arteries, were measured by confocal laser-scanning microscopy and fluorescent microscopy, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Possible <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> was evaluated by detecting any outgrowth of endothelial cells from pre-existing vessels or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002576'>intussusception</z:hpo> in Tie2-GFP mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Immediately after unilateral CCA occlusion, cerebral blood flow (CBF) index, the reciprocal of mean transit time, reduced significantly and returned to the previous level after 14 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Repeated observation of the cortical vessels did not reveal any <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath>, whereas the cortical capillary diameter increased by 74% after 14 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The anterior cerebral artery (ACA) and collateral vessels connecting ACA and middle cerebral artery also dilated significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The capillary <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> to the size of arteriole in the settings of collateral growth and CBF restoration suggested capillary remodeling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that capillary remodeling, pial artery <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> and collateral growth without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> are sufficient mechanisms to restore <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cerebral blood flow after unilateral CCA occlusion </plain></SENT>
