<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> may cause more pronounced ischemic changes in the brain in male SHR than in female SHR, resulting in a greater increase in <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> with a concomitant decrease in ATP in male SHR </plain></SENT>
