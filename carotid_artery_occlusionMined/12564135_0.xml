<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>An objective and practicable method to evaluate the brain tolerance to unilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was attempted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ten consecutive cases were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Endovascular trial balloon occlusion of the unilateral carotid artery in conjunction with single-<z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> emission computed tomography (SPECT) as well as digital subtraction angiography (DSA) and clinical neurological evaluation was routinely performed for those patients who might undergo permanent occlusion of the internal (ICA) and/or common carotid artery (CCA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The result of SPECT was analyzed semi-quantitatively and compared with the baseline data as well as the data from contralateral side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The relative symmetry index (rS) of side-to-side radioactivity counts relevant to the baseline was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One subject failed the balloon occlusion test (BOT), even though an angiographically adequate collateral circulation was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The rS of the patient was 74.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The remaining patients passed the 45-min BOT without any neurological deficiency induced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Their value of rS was 97.8% +/- 4.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Based the BOT results, the left ICA, CCA and external carotid artery were excised in one patient, CCA-ICA reconstructions after carotid occlusions were performed in three </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The carotid arteries were saved in five </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>For one patient, the ICA was occluded spontaneously during the BOT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There were no neurological impairments developed after the surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>With this BOT technique, clinically silent areas of decreased perfusion might be detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>We suggest it be a routine preparatory to carotid manipulations </plain></SENT>
