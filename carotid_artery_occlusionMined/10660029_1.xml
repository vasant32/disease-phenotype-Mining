<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Parent <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> is one of the traditional methods of treatment for unclippable <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, parent <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> may not result in permanent exclusion of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> from the systemic circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We present a case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>cerebral aneurysm</z:hpo> treated by proximal embolization of the parent artery, which recanalized during the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CASE DESCRIPTION: A 69-year-old woman presented with a right <z:hpo ids='HP_0000508'>blepharoptosis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000651'>diplopia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A large <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> arising from the cavernous portion of the right internal carotid artery was found and endovascularly excluded from the cerebral circulation by proximal internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> with balloons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eleven days after treatment, occlusion of the parent artery and obliteration of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> were angiographically confirmed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the parent artery was found to be recanalized with nearly total obliteration of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> at the follow-up 6 months after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Angiography suggested that recanalization took place through the vaso vasorum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We believe that recanalization was induced by marginal cerebral blood flow in the ipsilateral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
