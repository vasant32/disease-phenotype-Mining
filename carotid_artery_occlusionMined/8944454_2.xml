<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A total of 700 patients who had carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in the UK and Ireland during a 6-month interval between March and August 1994 were studied prospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some 108 patients (15.4 per cent) had a contralateral internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previous reports have shown an associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate of about 10 per cent in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study assessed complications and outcome for patients undergoing CEA with contralateral internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> compared with those without </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The indications for surgery were comparable between the two groups although the patients with occlusion had a slightly higher incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intraoperative shunts were used in a significantly higher proportion of those with occlusion (83.3 versus 64.7 per cent, P = 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The combined <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate for patients with occlusion was 5.6 per cent compared with 2.4 per cent for the remainder (P not significant) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On the basis of the present data, CEA with a contralateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> carries only a slight increase in the rate of postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This increase was not statistically significant and is lower than that reported previously </plain></SENT>
