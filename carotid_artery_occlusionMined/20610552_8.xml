<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In this study, we sought to clarify the role of inhibiting ubiquitin-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="33837">conjugated protein</z:chebi> aggregation in the formation of a neuroprotective effect after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> preconditioning using a transient global <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-reperfusion injury mouse model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: C57BL/6 mice were randomly assigned to 3 groups (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> preconditioning [IsoPC] group, control [Con] group, and sham group, n = 24 in each group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mice in the IsoPC group and sham group were placed in a chamber and pretreated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> (1.2% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi>, 98% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi>, 1 hour/day) for 5 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mice in the Con group were placed in the same chamber but pretreated with oxygen only (98% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi>, 2% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17997">N(2)</z:chebi>, 1 hour/day) for 5 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four hours after the last preconditioning day, bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was performed as a model of global <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> for 20 minutes in the IsoPC group and Con group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The total motor scores, number of viable neurons in the CA1 region of the hippocampus, and expression levels of conjugated ubiquitin or free ubiquitin were assessed by neurological assessment, immunohistochemistry, and Western blotting (at 24 and 72 hours) after reperfusion, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The total motor scores in the IsoPC group were better than the Con group (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Morphological observations showed that the IsoPC group had better neuron structure than in the Con group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The numbers of viable neurons in the CA1 region were significantly increased by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> preconditioning compared with those in the Con group (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The numbers of TUNEL-positive neurons in the CA1 region were significantly decreased after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> preconditioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The density of conjugated ubiquitin staining in the CA1 region of the IsoPC group was significantly lower than in the Con group (P &lt; 0.05) and the expression of conjugated ubiquitin in the IsoPC group was lower than in the Con group (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Inhibition of ubiquitin-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="33837">conjugated protein</z:chebi> aggregation may have an essential role in inducing cerebral ischemic tolerance by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> preconditioning in a transient global <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-reperfusion injury mouse model </plain></SENT>
