<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to compare ASL-MRI and H(2)(15)O <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30225">positron</z:chebi> emission tomography (PET), the gold standard for cerebral blood flow (CBF) assessment, in patients with a symptomatic internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients (63+/-14 years) with a symptomatic ICA occlusion underwent both ASL-MRI and H(2)(15)O PET </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The ASL-MRI was performed using a pulsed STAR labeling technique at multiple inversion times within 7 days of the PET </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The CBF was measured in the gray-matter of the anterior, middle and posterior cerebral artery, and white-matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both PET and ASL-MRI showed a significantly decreased CBF in the gray-matter of the middle cerebral artery in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the ICA occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The average gray-matter CBF measured with ASL-MRI (71.8+/-4.3 mL/min/100 g) was higher (P&lt;0.01) than measured with H(2)(15)O PET (43.1+/-1.0 mL/min/100 g) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, ASL-MRI at multiple TIs is capable of depicting areas of regions with low CBF in patients with an occlusion of the ICA, although a systematic overestimation of CBF relative to H(2)(15)O PET was noted </plain></SENT>
