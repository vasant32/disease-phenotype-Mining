<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To examine this question we combined occlusion of the left common carotid artery with embolism from the right common carotid artery in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Following ligation of the left carotid artery in 20 experimental rats, we irradiated the right carotid artery with a laser (632 nm, 200 mW/cm2, 12-15 minutes) following the intravenous injection of 12.5 mg/kg of the photosensitizing agent Photofrin II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Controls had left carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> with (n = 13) or without (n = 6) Photofrin II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fifteen of the 20 experimental rats survived to be perfused at 24 hours; cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> were identified in 12 rats, with bilateral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in 10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were 112 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (101 small [less than 2.5 mm] and 11 large [greater than 2.5 mm] on the right and 103 (93 small and 10 large) on the left </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Emboli were seen in association with some <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and were evenly distributed in the two hemispheres (37 emboli on the right and 40 on the left, with the midline azygous artery occluded in four animals) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Left carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> did not produce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> or emboli in the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> in the distribution of an occluded common carotid artery may be caused by emboli from the contralateral carotid artery in rats </plain></SENT>
