<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present a 54 year old male, treated topical since 23 years for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> and sent to our clinic for trabeculectomy because of rapid worsening of vision on right eye with bilateral total excavation of optic disc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Observational case report </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Because of typical signs of IOS (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011497'>iris neovascularization</z:hpo>, mid-peripheral dot and blot <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> in both eyes, narrowed arterioles in right eye, following examinations were performed: Doppler ultrasonography of carotid arteries, digital subtractional angiography of the carotid vessels and magnetic resonance angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The examinations showed occlusion of the right common carotid artery and with 80% stenosis of the left common carotid artery, occlusion of abdominal aorta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After phacoemulsification with implantation of intraocular lens because of rapid intumescence <z:hpo ids='HP_0000518'>cataract</z:hpo> in the right eye, and endarterectomy of left external carotid artery, the neovascularization of the iris regressed in both eyes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011497'>iris neovascularization</z:hpo> or mid-peripheral <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> the Doppler sonography of carotid arteries should be performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Quick cooperation between ophthalmologist, radiologist and vascular surgeon following endarterectomy seems to stop progressing changes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1321558" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ocular ischemic syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
