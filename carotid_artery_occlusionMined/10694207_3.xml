<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In gerbils, clomethiazole (600 micromol kg(-1)) injection produced a rapid appearance (peak within 5 min) of drug in plasma and brain and similar clearance (plasma t(1/2): 40 min) from both tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The peak brain concentration (226+/-56 nmol g(-1)) was 40% higher than plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One major metabolite, 5-(<z:chebi fb="0" ids="50341">1-hydroxyethyl</z:chebi>-2-chloro)-4-methylthiazole (NLA-715) and two minor metabolites 5-(<z:chebi fb="0" ids="50341">1-hydroxyethyl</z:chebi>)-4-methylthiazole (NLA-272) and 5-<z:chebi fb="9" ids="46887">acetyl</z:chebi>-4-methylthiazole (NLA-511) were detected in plasma and brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Evidence suggested that clomethiazole is metabolized directly to both NLA-715 and NLA-272 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Injection of NLA-715, NLA-272 or NLA-511 (each at 600 micromol kg(-1)) produced brain concentrations respectively 2.2, 38 and 92 times greater than seen after clomethiazole (600 micromol kg(-1)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clomethiazole (600 micromol kg(-1)) injected 60 min after a 5 min bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in gerbils attenuated the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e>-induced degeneration of the hippocampus by approximately 70% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The metabolites were not neuroprotective at this dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In mice, clomethiazole (600 micromol kg(-1)) produced peak plasma and brain concentrations approximately 100% higher than in gerbils, drug concentrations in several brain regions were similar but 35% higher than plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Clomethiazole (ED(50): 180 micromol kg(-1)) and NLA-715 (ED(50): 240 micromol kg(-1)) inhibited spontaneous locomotor activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The other metabolites were not sedative (ED(50) &gt;600 micromol kg(-1)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that the neuroprotective action of clomethiazole results from an action of the parent compound and that NLA-715 contributes to the sedative activity of the drug </plain></SENT>
