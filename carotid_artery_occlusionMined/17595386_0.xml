<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Few previous studies have focused on the fate of CO contralateral to the side of a prior carotid endarterectomy (CEA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to analyze the mortality rate and the incidence of cerebrovascular events in the hemisphere ipsilateral to CO (HICO) in patients who had undergone contralateral CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 30-day and long-term outcomes of 153 consecutive patients who had CEA for severe symptomatic and asymptomatic ICA lesions contralateral to a symptomatic or asymptomatic CO over a 15-year period were considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The endpoints of the study were mortality and neurological events in the HICO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall, the 30-day mortality and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rates were 0.6% (1/153) and 1.9% (3/153), respectively; the only <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-related and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was ipsilateral to the operated side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The other 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> were ipsilateral to a symptomatic CO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The follow-up was completed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients (mean, 7.7 years; range, 1-172 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall, there were 4 late <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> (2.6%), one of them lacunar in a patient with a symptomatic CO, whereas the other 3 were atheroembolic and ipsilateral to the operated ICA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The risk of late <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in the HICO at 5 and 12 years was 2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Overall, there were 19 late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, none of them <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-related </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CO, with or without symptoms, contralateral to CEA could be considered a locally benign condition in the long term </plain></SENT>
