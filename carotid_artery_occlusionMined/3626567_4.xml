<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We observed highly significant qualitative and quantitative (p less than 0.001) correlations between these two parameters, under five well-established experimental cardiovascular perturbations that are known to promote inotropic actions, viz, vagosympathetic trunk stimulation; intravenous administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7983">pentobarbital</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="28918">epinephrine</z:chebi>, or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8093">phenylephrine</z:chebi>; and temporary common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Preliminary experiments using isometric ventricular contraction as the reference also confirmed these observations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that the SAdP/dt may qualify, at the systemic level, as an easily accessible experimental index for ventricular contractility </plain></SENT>
