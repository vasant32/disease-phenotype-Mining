<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A brief period of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> is followed by severe inhibition of protein synthesis which is slowly reversed in the resistant but not in the selectively vulnerable regions of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Inhibition occurs at the translational level, as evidenced by the disaggregation of ribosomes into monosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In order to evaluate the importance of this disturbance for the evolution of ischemic injury, the effect of the neuroprotective drug, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7983">pentobarbital</z:chebi>, on ribosomal aggregation was studied in gerbils subjected to 5 min bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="7983">Pentobarbital</z:chebi> (50 mg/kg, i.p.) was applied shortly after the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, and the aggregational state of ribosomes was investigated by electron microscopy after recirculation times ranging from 15 min to 1 day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="7983">Pentobarbital</z:chebi> treatment did not prevent the initial post-ischemic disaggregation but promoted the subsequent reaggregation in the selectively vulnerable neurons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This suggests that post-ischemic application of <z:chebi fb="25" ids="22693">barbiturates</z:chebi> exerts its beneficial effect by reversing the post-ischemic block of ribosomal reaggregation in vulnerable regions </plain></SENT>
