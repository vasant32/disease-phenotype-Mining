<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to use microdialysis to detect any local <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> which might be caused by brain retraction or temporary clipping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Parameters were therefore quantified whose levels in the dialysate are known to be influenced by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (on-line pH, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22652,29073">ascorbic acid</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi>, cysteine, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>:<z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> ratio) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> series, on-line pH fell after introduction of the retractor, and in the majority of cases the other parameters also showed changes in accordance with ischemic conditions in the region of the probe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These changes disappeared at the end of retraction, or sometimes even before </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During the bypass operations, there were no marked changes in on-line pH or in any of the measured parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, in some of these patients values for the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>:<z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> ratio, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="22652,29073">ascorbic acid</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27226">uric acid</z:chebi> lay outside the suggested basal levels for minimally disturbed cortex, indicating possible changes in metabolism caused by inadequate perfusion (carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that microdialysis is a sensitive method of detecting intraoperative changes in cerebral metabolism </plain></SENT>
