<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe a simple method, nuclear contrast angiography, that enables simultaneous visualization of the arterial tree and cerebral endothelial cells in rodent brain whole mounts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A mixture of latex and black ink was injected into the arterial system of rodents, resulting in high contrast demarcation of the arterial tree of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This method clearly differentiates arteries from veins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We applied this method to demonstrate that 14 days of unilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> induces increases in the caliber of (1) bilateral anterior communicating arteries, (2) bilateral anterior cerebral arteries, and (3) ipsilateral proximal middle cerebral artery of the circle of Willis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Unlike other methods, this procedure selectively stains endothelial nuclei of arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, cerebral endothelial nuclei can be visualized, quantitated, and morphologically characterized at the same time the cortical arterial tree is delineated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This method should be useful in studies of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and cerebral arteriogenesis, which require the accurate assessment of both arterial diameters and endothelial cell density </plain></SENT>
