<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During 30 minutes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, <z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15866">deoxyglucose</z:chebi> uptake in the brain was increased along the border zone between the ischemic and nonischemic area and decreased in the ischemic areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During the early stage of reperfusion (2 or 3 to 30 minutes), CMRG increased 50 to 150% in the cerebral cortex, caudoputamen and thalamus and 270 to 320% in the hippocampus, globus pallidus and amygdala </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During the late stage of reperfusion (15 to 45 minutes), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of CMRG appeared in the cerebral cortex, caudoputamen and thalamus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CMRG decreased to less than 50% of the control value in the cerebral cortex but remained at 200 to 300% of control in the hippocampus, globus pallidus and amygdala </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The latter structures exhibited a larger and more protracted increase in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism than the other structures most probably due to the histological vulnerability to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> of these structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The relationship between the transient increase of the <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> metabolism and cell function is discussed </plain></SENT>
