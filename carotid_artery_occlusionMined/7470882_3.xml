<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The gerbil was connected to the 2 channel fluorometer/reflectometer by flexible light guides implanted above the two hemispheres of the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results show that: (1) the metabolic rate as measured by this present technique is lower in the gerbil than in the rat; (2) the metabolic rate of the ischemic hemisphere is lower as compared to that of the normoxic contralateral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
