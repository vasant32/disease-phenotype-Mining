<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We examined the brain <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> which accompanies 30 min of bilateral carotid artery ligation (BCAL) in terms of changes in brain levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi>; reduced (GSH) and oxidized (GSSG) forms and the exacerbation of <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4659">disulfiram</z:chebi> (DSF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that BCAL alone decreases GSH content and limits <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> reductase (GR) activity, and these changes were enhanced by DSF pretreatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Similar observations were recorded with DSF alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>GR activity (74.3 +/- 4.0 micromol min(-1) mg(-1) tissue; p &lt; 0.001) and GSH content (1.23 +/- 0.06 micromol min(-1) g(-1) tissue; p &lt; 0.001) was attenuated in rats subjected to synergistic effect of BCAL and DSF with a concomitant increase of GSSG (0.006 +/- 0.006 micromol min(-1) g(-1) tissue; p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recovery of GSH/GSSG level and GR activity during reperfusion following 30 min BCAL was considerably delayed (96 h) in the BCAL and DSF group as compared to the recovery time of 24 h in the group subjected to BCAL-reperfusion alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Perturbation of GSH/GSSG homeostasis as a result of BCAL was augmented by DSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings clearly demonstrate central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> due to a BCAL-DSF synergistic effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Based on the results obtained with this model, we conclude that DSF increases brain <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and this may be detrimental to alcoholics who might drink and develop an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15343,43923">acetaldehyde</z:chebi>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> while taking DSF </plain></SENT>
