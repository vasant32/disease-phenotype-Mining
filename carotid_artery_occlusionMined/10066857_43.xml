<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cerebral hemodynamics were studied with transcranial Doppler ultrasonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cerebrovascular reactivity to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002104'>apnea</z:hpo> was calculated by means of the breath-holding index (BHI) in the middle cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sixty-five patients with internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> were followed-up prospectively (median, 24 months), 23 patients were asymptomatic and 42 symptomatic (20 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> and 22 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the follow-up period, 11 symptomatic patients and 1 asymptomatic patient had another ischemic event ipsilateral to carotid occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among factors considered, only lower BHI values in the middle cerebral arteries ipsilateral to carotid occlusion and older age were significantly associated with the risk of developing symptoms (P=0.002 and P=0.003, respectively; Cox regression multivariate analysis) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Based on our data, a cut point of the BHI value for distinguishing between pathological and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cerebrovascular reactivity was determined to be 0.69 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients except one, who developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> during the follow-up period, had BHI values ipsilateral to carotid occlusion of &lt;0.69 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that impaired cerebrovascular reactivity is predictive for cerebral ischemic events in patients with carotid occlusion </plain></SENT>
