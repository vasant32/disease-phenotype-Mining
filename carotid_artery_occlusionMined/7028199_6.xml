<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>1 The generation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26347">prostanoids</z:chebi> in the hearts of anaesthetized dogs was studied by irrigating in situ the epicardial surface with Krebs solution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="26347">Prostanoids</z:chebi> were measured by direct bioassay on smooth muscles and by radioimmunoassay of 6-oxo-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28852">prostaglandin F1 alpha</z:chebi> (6-oxo-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28852">PGF1 alpha</z:chebi>) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">prostaglandin E2</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi>) in the epicardial irrigation fluid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>2 The epicardial irrigation fluid contained a prostacyclin-like substance, as indicated by the bioassay tissues, and immunoreactive 6-oxo-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28852">PGF1 alpha</z:chebi>; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi>-like materials were also detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By both methods the output of the prostacyclin-like substance, which decreased with time of epicardial irrigation, was increased by manipulating the heart and by adding <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15843">arachidonic acid</z:chebi> (3 microgram/ml), and decreased by adding <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi> (1 microgram/ml) to the irrigation fluid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>3 Bioassayed prostacyclin and immunoreactive 6-oxo-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28852">PGF1 alpha</z:chebi> in the epicardial irrigation fluid increased by about 3-5 ng/ml during and after infusion of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoprenaline</z:chebi> (0.1 microgram kg-1 min-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The substance was not released by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6046">isoprenaline</z:chebi> when <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi> was added to the irrigation fluid, or when <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8499">propranolol</z:chebi> (0.5 mg/kg) was given intravenously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>4 Aortic constriction, bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and intravenous angiotensin infusion <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> increased output of the prostacyclin-like substance into the epicardial irrigation fluid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The output was abolished by treating the heart with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi> (10 mg/kg intravenously or 1 microgram/ml epicardially) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>5 The prostacyclin-like substance was also released by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the above stimuli after the parietal pericardium had been removed and replaced by a plastic sheet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>6 It is concluded that prostacyclin is continually released from tissues close to the epicardial surface and from the pericardium, and that prostacyclin generation increases when cardiac workload increases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Prostacyclin of epicardial or pericardial origin might therefore contribute to metabolic regulation of coronary blood flow </plain></SENT>
