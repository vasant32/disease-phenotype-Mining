<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the current study, the authors examined the hypothesis that exogenous IGF-1 could reduce postischemic white matter injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Bilateral brain injury was induced in near-term fetal sheep by 30 minutes of reversible carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ninety minutes after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, either vehicle (n = 8) or a single dose of 3 microg IGF-1 (n = 9) was infused intracerebroventricularly over 1 hour </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>White matter changes were assessed after 4 days recovery in the parasagittal intragyral white matter and underlying <z:chebi fb="47" ids="37409">corona</z:chebi> radiata </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Proteolipid protein (PLP) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> staining was used to identify bioactive oligodendrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and isolectin B-4 immunoreactivity were used to label astrocytes and microglia, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Myelin basic protein (MBP) density and the area of the intragyral white matter tracts were determined by image analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Insulin-like growth factor-1 treatment was associated with significantly reduced loss of oligodendrocytes in the intragyral white matter (P &lt; 0.05), with improved MBP density (P &lt; 0.05), reduced tissue swelling, and increased numbers of GFAP and isolectin B-4 positive cells compared with vehicle treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> there was a close association of PLP <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> labeled cells with reactive astrocytes and macrophages/microglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, IGF-1 can prevent delayed, postischemic oligodendrocyte cell loss and associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0011096'>demyelination</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
