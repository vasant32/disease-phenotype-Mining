<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Continuous arterial spin labeling (CASL) is a noninvasive magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) method for measuring cerebral perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In its most widely used form, CASL incorporates a postlabeling delay to minimize the sensitivity of the technique to transit time effects, which otherwise corrupt cerebral blood flow (CBF) quantification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For this delay to work effectively, it must be longer than the longest transit time present in the system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this work, CASL measurements were made in four coronal slices in the rat brain using a range of postlabeling delays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By doing this, direct estimation of both CBF and arterial transit time (delta(a)) was possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These measurements were performed in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> brain and during hypoperfusion induced by occlusion of the common carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It was found that, in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rat brain, significant regional variation exists for both CBF and delta(a) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean values of CBF and delta(a) in the selected gray matter regions of interest were 233 mL/100 g min and 266 ms, respectively, with the latter ranging from 100 to 500 ms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, use of a 500-ms postlabeling delay is suitable for any location in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rat brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, CBF decreased and delta(a) increased by regionally dependent amounts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the sensory cortex, delta(a) increased to a mean value of 740 ms, significantly greater than 500 ms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results highlight the importance of either (a) determining delta(a) as part of the CASL measurement or (b) knowing the approximate range of values delta(a) is likely to take for a given application, so that the parameters of the CASL sequence can be chosen appropriately </plain></SENT>
