<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> secondary to cerebral vessel occlusion is still an important cause of mortality and morbidity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Excitatory <z:chebi fb="65" ids="25512">neurotransmitters</z:chebi> are gathered in the extracellular space during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and initiate or stimulate a series of pathophysiological biochemical processes and consequently lead to neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Tizanidine (Sandoz compound DS 103-282, 5-chloro4,2 (2-imidazolin-2-yl-amino)-2,1,3-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="45993">benzothiazol</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi>) is a selective alpha 2 adrenoreceptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> which shows its effect by stimulating presynaptic alpha 2 adrenoreceptors in central ASPergic and GLUergic system by inhibiting aspartic acid and glutamic acid release </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, the effect of Tizanidine on reversible focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Cerebral blood flow to the left hemisphere of adult Sprague-Dawley rats (n=48) was temporarily interrupted by middle cerebral artery and bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> for 3 hours in eight rats of each group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Tizanidine was given to each group of rats intraperitoneally before the ischemic insult, 2 hours after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, right after the reperfusion, 2 h after reperfusion, and 4 hours after reperfusion; the animals survived for 24 hours after the reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After killing and triphenyltetrasoliumchloride staining of brain slices, infarction volumes and ratios of the brains were calculated and the results were compared with those of the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Infarction volumes and infarction ratios of the Tizanidine group 1/2 hours before <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (143.7+/-6.34 mm3 and 10.1+/-0.43%) and the Tizanidine group 2 hours after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (145.6+/-6.32 mm3 and 10.3+/-0.43%) were found to be significantly lower in favor of the Tizanidine groups when compared with those of the control group (173.9+/-6.38 mm3 and 12,4+/-0.41%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Tizanidine is not effective if used just after reperfusion or later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study shows that Tizanidine pretreatment before the ischemic insult and the administration of the drug within the 2 hours after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> reduces ischemic damage significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Therefore, this drug can be used as a protective and therapeutic agent in ischemic diseases </plain></SENT>
