<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have measured nerve growth factor (NGF) content in brain of adult rats with bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> exposed to 7% O2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Five days after <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> the NGF content was increased in neostriatum, hippocampus and cerebral neocortex, areas exhibiting focal <z:mp ids='MP_0002229'>neuronal degeneration</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The increase was not related to changes in <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15354">choline</z:chebi> acetyltransferase activity that was only reduced in heavily damaged cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The findings may indicate that the increase in NGF content was due to enhanced NGF synthesis by inflammatory cells including stimulated glia </plain></SENT>
