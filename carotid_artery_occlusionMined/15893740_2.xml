<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Most functional neuroimaging techniques rely on activation-flow coupling (AFC) to detect changes in regional brain function, but AFC responses may also be altered during pathophysiological conditions such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To define the relationship between progressive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and the AFC response, graded levels of cerebral blood flow reduction were produced using a rat compression <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> model, and the cerebral hemodynamic response to forepaw stimulation was measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Graded levels of cortical <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> of the somatosensory cortex were induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 16) by compressing the intact dura with a 4-mm-diameter cylinder equipped with a laser-Doppler probe, combined with ipsilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At each level of CBF reduction, electric forepaw stimulation was conducted, and signal-averaged laser Doppler and evoked potential responses were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A visible AFC response was present at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> levels of CBF reduction (0-90% reduction from baseline), and the temporal characteristics of the response appeared largely preserved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the amplitude of the AFC response began to decline at levels of mild <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (10% flow reduction) and progressively decreased with further CBF reduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The amplitude of the evoked response appeared to decrease in concert with the AFC amplitude and appeared to be equally sensitive to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>AFC appears to be a sensitive marker for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, and alterations in the AFC response occur at CBF reductions above the accepted thresholds for infarction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the AFC response is also preserved when flow is reduced below ischemic thresholds </plain></SENT>
