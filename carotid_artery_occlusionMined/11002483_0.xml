<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We experienced a patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the unilateral internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We monitored the brain tissue temperature and intracranial pressure not only in both hemispheres simultaneously but also continuously throughout the process of brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patient was a 73-year-old male who presented to our emergency room with right <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002381'>aphasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On admission to our department, no specific pathological findings were identified by brain CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However a following investigation with left carotid arteriogram demonstrated a complete occlusion of the left internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Probes to monitor intraparenchymal temperature (Tip) and intracranial pressure(ICP) were inserted surgically into the bilateral hemispheres, and these two parameters were monitored continuously until the patient's <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Initially, Tip in the infarcted hemisphere was lower than that in the intact hemisphere, and the left hemisphere's ICP was significantly higher than that of the right one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When the ICP in the left hemisphere exceeded 40 mmHg, bilateral ICPs became equal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Brain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019270" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herniation</z:e> was confirmed when the ICP became progressively elevated thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Subsequently the bilateral Tips became equal and lower than the bladder temperature following the brain <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019270" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herniation</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In this case, we successfully monitored two parameters while the patient was in the process of brain <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>; i.e., <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e>, complete loss of brain circulation and subsequent decrease in the brain tissue temperature </plain></SENT>
