<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging has been shown to be particularly suited to the study of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in animal models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The studies reported in this paper were undertaken to determine whether this technique is sensitive to the known ischemic thresholds for cerebral tissue energy failure and disturbance of membrane ion gradients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Diffusion-weighted images of the gerbil brain were acquired under two sets of experimental conditions: as a function of cerebral blood flow after controlled graded occlusion of the common carotid arteries (partial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>), as a function of time following complete bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (severe global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>), and on deocclusion after 60 minutes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During partial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, the diffusion-weighted images remained unchanged until the cerebral blood flow was reduced to 15-20 ml.100 g-1.min-1 and below, when image intensity increased as the cerebral blood flow was lowered further </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This is similar to the critical flow threshold for maintenance of tissue high-energy metabolites and ion homeostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of severe global <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, diffusion-weighted image intensity increased gradually after a delay of approximately 2.5 minutes, consistent with complete loss of tissue <z:chebi fb="3" ids="15422">adenosine triphosphate</z:chebi> and with the time course of increase in extracellular <z:chebi fb="120" ids="26216">potassium</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This hyperintensity decreased on deocclusion following 60 minutes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that diffusion-weighted imaging is sensitive to the disruption of tissue energy metabolism or a consequence of this disruption </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This raises the possibility of imaging energy failure noninvasively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In humans, this could have potential in visualizing brain regions where energy metabolism is impaired, particularly during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase following <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
