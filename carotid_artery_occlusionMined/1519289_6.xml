<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">N-methyl-D-aspartate</z:chebi> receptor is believed to mediate part of the ischemic neuronal damage caused by the excitatory amino acid <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>(+)SKF 10,047, the prototypic sigma-<z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi>, interacts with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">N-methyl-D-aspartate</z:chebi> receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we studied the neuroprotective effect of (+)SKF 10,047 on cultured rat cerebellar neurons and on CA1 hippocampal neurons of gerbils exposed to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Mechanisms of neuroprotection were studied in vitro by measuring calcium influx into cultured rat cerebellar granule cells loaded with fura 2-AM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In vivo neuroprotection of gerbil CA1 hippocampal neurons was studied in a posttreatment regimen following 5 minutes of bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and 7 days of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In primary cultured rat cerebellar granule cell neurons, (+)SKF 10,047 in a dose-dependent manner diminished intracellular calcium levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">N-methyl-D-aspartate</z:chebi>-stimulated neurons by a maximum of 87% (n = 8), with a 50% inhibitory concentration of 0.8 microM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>(+)SKF 10,047 did not prevent subsequent calcium influx stimulated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31746">kainic acid</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32588">KCl</z:chebi>, nor did it interfere with modulation of the kainate response by quisqualic acid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neuroprotection of 64% (p = 0.006, n = 15) of gerbil CA1 hippocampal neurons was achieved by posttreatment injection followed by minipump infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Neuroprotection by (+)SKF 10,047 most likely involves interaction at the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31882">N-methyl-D-aspartate</z:chebi> receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the benzomorphan class of sigma-<z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> may provide neuroprotection in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
