<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One group of 15 gerbils received a single injection of 25 microliter of 5 microM cyclohexyladenosine into the cerebral ventricle 15 minutes after release of the occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Another group of 45 gerbils received a similar injection of the vehicle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five days after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, the hippocampal histology was examined under light microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the gerbils treated with the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> receptor <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonist</z:chebi> N-6-cyclohexyladenosine, the CA1 region of the hippocampus showed significant quantitative pyramidal cell preservation (p less than 0.01, Mann-Whitney U test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Qualitatively, substantial destruction of CA1 neurons was present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> hippocampi of the vehicle-injected gerbils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The CA1 neurons in the cyclohexyladenosine-treated gerbils did not differ from those seen in the five nonischemic controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The precise mechanism of the protective action of cyclohexyladenosine is unknown, although it has been demonstrated that <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="4" ids="48705">agonists</z:chebi> reduce presynaptic <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> release in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is possible that postischemic administration of cyclohexyladenosine decreases the release of this neurotransmitter in the intact brain as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The concomitant reduction of the neurotoxic effect of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> may, therefore, result in better histologic preservation of the pyramidal cells in the postischemic CA1 </plain></SENT>
