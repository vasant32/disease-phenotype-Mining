<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cerebral revascularization is possible only in case of patent carotid bifurcation, three patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of them symptomatic (2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>'s and 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100576'>amaurosis fugax</z:hpo>) with a complete common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> have been treated with a subclavian-carotid artery by-pass (2 PTFE, 1 reversed saphenous vein) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among the patients one <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> occurred in the fourth postoperative day by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006285" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bronchopneumonia</z:e>, no <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was detected, in the remaining two, the by-pass was patent one year and respectively three years post-operatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In case of common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, visualization of bifurcation is usually better obtained through a color-duplex than arteriography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Several operations have been proposed in these patients (retrograde thrombectomy, carotid to carotid by-pass, carotid-subclavian reimplantation), but subclavian to carotid by-pass is the most safe and common used procedure </plain></SENT>
