<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Reliable data on the frequency of these phenomena and their potential prognostic relevance are still sparse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To provide more data about the frequency of low-flow <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> and investigate their influence on outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Medical records of 260 consecutive patients with symptomatic ICA occlusion were carefully reviewed (survey period: January 2000 to December 2006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Baseline <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> severity and outcome at 90 days and in the long term were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were specifically questioned about symptoms of LS and RC, were exposed to bright light (pupillary testing) and carefully watched during testing of posture/gait and early mobilization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: LS, RC or both occurred in 28.6, 9.5 and 2.7%, respectively, of patients eligible for a thorough assessment of low-flow <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> (n = 147) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An adverse outcome was more likely in patients with LS than in those without at day 90 (modified Ranking Scale â‰¥4, 45.2 vs. 21.9%, p = 0.005) and in the long term (median, 37 months) (52.7 vs. 23.1%, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In a multivariable analysis, prognostic relevance was found to be independent of baseline <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> severity (National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was also a tendency towards higher rates of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> in limb shakers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RC had no prognostic relevance regarding functional outcome and recurrent events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In patients with ICA occlusion, RC and LS are more common than previously assumed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The presence of LS is associated with a worse outcome independent of initial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> severity and patient characteristics </plain></SENT>
