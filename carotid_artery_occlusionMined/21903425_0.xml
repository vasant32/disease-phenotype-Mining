<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs) and numbers needed to treat (NNTs) were appropriately calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A sub-analysis was performed on studies directly comparing ECEA vs. patch CEA (PCEA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Meta-regression analysis was performed to examine the effect of potentially meaningful patient-related, procedure-related and definition-related modifiers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Power calculations were also conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 21 studies were deemed eligible (8530 ECEA and 7721 CCEA procedures), seven of which were randomised and 14 non-randomised </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ECEA was associated with significant reduction in perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (OR = 0.46, 95%CI: 0.35-0.62, NNT = 68, 95%CI: 56-96), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (OR = 0.49, 95%CI: 0.34-0.69, NNT = 100, 95%CI: 85-185) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (OR = 0.40, 95%CI: 0.23-0.67, NNT = 147, 95%CI: 115-270); the results were replicated at the sub-analysis on PCEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Concerning long-term outcomes, ECEA presented with a significant reduction in late carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (OR = 0.48, 95%CI: 0.25-0.90, NNT = 143, 95%CI: 100-769) and late mortality (OR = 0.76, 95%CI: 0.61-0.94, NNT = 40, 95%CI: 25-167); the sub-analysis on PCEA replicated only the finding on late mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Meta-regression analysis did not point to significant effects mediated by the examined modifiers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Power calculations suggested adequate statistical power </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: ECEA compared to CCEA may be associated with a lower incidence in both short-term and long-term outcomes, which does not seem to be hampered by potentially meaningful modifiers </plain></SENT>
