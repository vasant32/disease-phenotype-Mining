<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: A 56-year-old man consulted for a recurrent left serous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000388'>otitis media</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CT-scan and MRI showed a lesion filling completely the middle ear, extending along the Eustachian tube up to the nasopharynx, with enhancement after injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The biopsy of the lesion confirmed the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>malignant melanoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After left internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, the removal of the lesion was performed by a double surgical approach: combination of an endoscopic transnasal and a retroauricular approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Radiotherapy was adjuvant therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Eustachian tube <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo> is a rare occurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Surgical treatment must be radical, what represents a challenge considering the localization; it can be obtained with the double surgical approach proposed in our case report </plain></SENT>
