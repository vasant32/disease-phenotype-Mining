<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Quantitative perfusion MRI is a promising new technique capable of offering information on cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume (CBV), and mean transit time (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it is still unclear how these perfusion parameters relate to the underlying physiological indicators and how they compare to conventional techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to investigate how quantitative perfusion MRI is related to the cerebrovascular reactivity as measured by transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (TCD) in combination with a <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> stimulus in patients with a symptomatic occlusion of the internal carotid artery (ICA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty-nine patients with transient or minor disabling <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> or hemispheric ischemic symptoms and an occlusion of the ICA underwent quantitative perfusion MRI and <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> reactivity measurements by TCD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Perfusion parameters were correlated with cerebrovascular reactivity measurements and compared with measurements of control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results of this study show a negative correlation between the cerebrovascular reactivity and the time to bolus peak (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35019">TBP</z:chebi>) both for gray (r = -0.26, P = 0.035) and white matter (r = -0.28, P = 0.026) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No correlation between resting CBV, CBF, or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> and cerebrovascular reactivity was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that an increase in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35019">TBP</z:chebi> reflects a poor development of collateral flow, which is supported by a relatively low <z:chebi fb="97" ids="29325">CO2</z:chebi> reactivity in these patients </plain></SENT>
