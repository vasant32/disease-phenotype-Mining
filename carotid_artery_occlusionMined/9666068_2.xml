<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intense cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was noticed starting from 5 h after the second ischemic insult, reaching maximum levels in the nucleus caudate-putamen and thalamus at 12-24 h, but in the cortex and hippocampus at 2 days post-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although tissue damage developed gradually, the region of progressive infarction could be delineated as an area deficient in gfap <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> starting from 12 h, more apparent 24 h after repeated ischemic insults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hsp72 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was strongly increased in the cortex, caudate-putamen, ventrolateral thalamus, CA1-CA4 fields and dentate gyrus in the early stages, i.e., 15 min-5 h post-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>C-jun <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was also elevated in these structures except for the CA1 field, where <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels remained low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the caudate-putamen and thalamus, where DNA fragmentation occurred rapidly, c-jun and hsp72 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> declined to almost basal levels within 12 h after repeated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, whereas in the other structures, c-jun and hsp72 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> decreased in a more delayed fashion by 24-48 h </plain></SENT>
