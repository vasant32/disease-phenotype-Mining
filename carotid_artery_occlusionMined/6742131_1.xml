<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Pressure <z:mp ids='MP_0006316'>natriuresis</z:mp> was studied in anesthetized saline-expanded adult (n = 10) and neonatal (n = 23) dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One group (protocol B) received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4876">ethacrynic acid</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2639">amiloride</z:chebi> to block distal nephron function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Studies in the other group (protocol A) were done without <z:chebi fb="40" ids="35498">diuretics</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Renal arterial blood pressure was raised by bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Renal perfusion pressure was then lowered in steps by partially occluding the aorta proximal to the renal arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In protocol B carotid occlusion was associated with an increase in both absolute and fractional <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> excretion by adult and newborn dogs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, there was significant negative correlation (P less than 0.01) between absolute change in renal arterial pressure and change in tubular reabsorption of <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> per milliliter glomerular filtrate for both age groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For each mmHg increase in blood pressure there was greater inhibition of <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> reabsorption in the puppy (0.55 mueq/ml glomerular filtrate) than in the adult (0.18 mueq/ml, P less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In protocol A puppies, the inhibition of <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> reabsorption due to increases in renal perfusion pressure was less than that occurring in protocol B, indicating that some of the <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> escaping proximal nephron reabsorption was reabsorbed distally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Results of these studies indicate that during saline expansion pressure <z:mp ids='MP_0006316'>natriuresis</z:mp> is primarily a proximal tubular event, and the sensitivity of the proximal tubule to changes in renal arterial blood pressure is greater in the newborn than the adult kidney </plain></SENT>
