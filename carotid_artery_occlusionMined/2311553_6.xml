<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Newborn rats were raised in litters of 6 or 14 pups from day 2 to 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On postnatal day 7, those immature rats raised in litters of 14 weighed 18% less than animals raised in litters of 6 (P less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They then were subjected to cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> by unilateral common carotid artery ligation followed by 3 h of exposure to 8% oxygen-92% nitrogen at 37 degrees C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Upon return to their dams, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> litters were culled to 6 pups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 30 days of age, the animals underwent perfusion-fixation of their brains under <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7983">pentobarbital</z:chebi> anesthesia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Brain damage was assessed by measuring the length and width of each cerebral hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The extent of brain damage varied from no difference in the size of the two cerebral hemispheres to marked shrinkage of the hemisphere ipsilateral to the common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The range of brain damage between the well-nourished and poorly nourished animals was comparable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Rank order of the extent of damage demonstrated significantly greater tissue injury in those animals well nourished prior to <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (Mann-Whitney U-test; P = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that nutritional deprivation in the immature rat is associated with a decreased rather than increased susceptibility to brain damage arising from <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
