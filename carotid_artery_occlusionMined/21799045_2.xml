<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The regional leptomeningeal score is a strong and reliable imaging predictor of good clinical outcomes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> anterior circulation <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo> and can therefore be used for imaging based patient selection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Efforts to determine biological determinants of collateral status are needed if techniques to alter collateral behavior and extend time windows are to succeed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective Institutional Review Board-approved study of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> and M1 middle cerebral artery+/- intracranial internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> at our center from 2003 to 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The rLMC score is based on scoring pial and lenticulostriate arteries (0, no; 1, less; 2, equal or more prominent compared with matching region in opposite hemisphere) in 6 ASPECTS regions (M1-6) plus anterior cerebral artery region and basal ganglia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Pial arteries in the Sylvian sulcus are scored 0, 2, or 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Good clinical outcome was defined as mRS ≤ 2 at 90 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The analysis included 138 patients: 37.6% had a good (17-20), 40.5% a medium (11-16), and 21.7% a poor (0-10) rLMC score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interrater reliability was high, with an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.87 (95% CI, 0.77%-0.95%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>On univariate analysis, no single vascular risk factor was associated with the presence of poor rLMCs (P ≥ .20 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> comparisons) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In multivariable analysis, the rLMC score (good versus poor: OR, 16.7; 95% CI, 2.9%-97.4%; medium versus poor: OR, 9.2, 95% CI, 1.7%-50.6%), age (&lt; 80 years), baseline ASPECTS (≥ 8), and clot burden score (≥ 8) were independent predictors of good clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The rLMC score is a strong imaging parameter on CT angiography for predicting clinical outcomes in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
