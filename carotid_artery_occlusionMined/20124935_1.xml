<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Carotid artery angioplasty and carotid artery stenting (CAS) offer a viable alternative to carotid endarterectomy for symptomatic and asymptomatic patients; however, the complication rates associated with CAS may be higher than previously documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the safety and efficacy of CAS in high surgical risk patients in a single neurovascular center retrospective review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: An institutional review board-approved retrospective review of the clinical variables and treatment outcomes of 101 consecutive patients (109 stents) from July 2001 to March 2007 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both symptomatic and asymptomatic stenoses were studied in high surgical risk patients as defined by the SAPPHIRE (Stenting and Angioplasty with Protection in Patients at High-Risk for Endarterectomy) trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Specifically, those patients with clinically significant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cardiac disease</z:e> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo>, abnormal stress test, or need for open-heart surgery), severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024115" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary disease</z:e>, contralateral carotid occlusion, contralateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0542142" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">laryngeal nerve palsy, recurrent</z:e> stenosis after carotid endarterectomy, previous radical neck surgery, or radiation therapy to the neck, and an age older than 80 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventy-four percent of the patients were symptomatic (n = 81), and the mean stenosis in symptomatic patients was 83% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Reasons for stenting included cardiac/pulmonary/medical risk (60%), contralateral internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (8%), recurrent stenosis after carotid endarterectomy (11%), carotid dissection (6%), age older than 80 (7%), previous radical neck surgery (7%), and previous neck radiation (1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Stent deployment was achieved in 108 of 109 vessels (99%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Distal embolic protection devices were used in 72% of cases treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The overall rate of in-hospital adverse events (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo>, minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>) was 8.3% (9 of 109) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of these events, 2 patients (1.8%) experienced a hemispheric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (neurological symptoms that resolved within 24 hours), 2 others (1.8%) had transiently symptomatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> reperfusion syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The 30-day <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> risk was 4.6% (n = 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Of these patients, 3 had minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> (2.7%) defined as a modified Rankin Scale score less than 3 at 1-year follow-up, 1 had a major <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (0.9%) defined as a modified Rankin Scale score of 3 or more at 1-year follow-up, and 1 patient died after a periprocedural <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> (0.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CAS can be performed with a low 30-day complication rate, even with a higher percentage of symptomatic lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The results support the use of CAS in high surgical risk patients with both significant symptomatic and asymptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
