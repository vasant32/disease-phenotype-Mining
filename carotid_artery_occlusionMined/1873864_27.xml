<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Vessel diameter and velocity of blood flow through the basilar artery were measured using a cranial window in 45 anesthetized rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mean blood flow velocity through the basilar artery increased by 94 +/- 8% during unilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and 203 +/- 13% during bilateral occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Diameter of the basilar artery increased by 10 +/- 1% during unilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and 29 +/- 2% during bilateral occlusion from control diameter of 275 +/- 8 microns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Vasodilatation appeared with a delay of 13 +/- 1 seconds after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the increase in flow velocity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With systemic arterial pressure maintained at baseline levels, pressure in the basilar artery (servonull) decreased initially during carotid occlusion, and during <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> of the basilar artery, pressure was restored partially toward <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
