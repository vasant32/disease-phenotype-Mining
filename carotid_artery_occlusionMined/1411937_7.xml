<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 66 (13.8%) of 478 patients undergoing 544 CEAs, the contralateral ICA was occluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mean follow-up was 50.1 months (range, 1 to 165 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Complete follow-up was available in 83.0% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Operative <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> occurred in one (1.5%) of 66 patients with contralateral occlusion and six (1.3%) of 478 patients without contralateral occlusion (p = 0.99) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Operative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> occurred in two (3.0%) of 66 patients with contralateral occlusion and 14 (2.9%) of 478 without contralateral occlusion (p = 0.99) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Life-table <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-free rates at 1, 3, 5, and 8 years were 96.8%, 93.0%, and 93.0% in patients with contralateral occlusion and 95.9%, 94.2%, 91.1%, and 88.0% in patients without contralateral occlusion (p = 0.36) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Five- and 8-year <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-free rates were 100% and 100% in the asymptomatic subgroup with occlusion, 95.9% and 92.2% in the asymptomatic subgroup without occlusion (p = 0.45), 91.2% and 91.2% in the symptomatic subgroup with occlusion, and 89.7% and 86.8% in the symptomatic subgroup without occlusion (p = 0.47) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Life-table survival rates at 5 and 8 years were 72.5% and 56.0% in patients with contralateral occlusion and 81.8% and 69.0% in patients without contralateral occlusion (p = 0.15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CEA performed in patients with and without symptoms with a contralateral ICA occlusion produces short- and long-term mortality and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> morbidity rates comparable to those of similar patients without contralateral ICA occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The indications for CEA in patients with contralateral ICA occlusion should not differ from those applied to patients without contralateral occlusion </plain></SENT>
