<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Pituitary adenylate cyclase activating <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> (PACAP) is known for its potent neuroprotective effects, including the retinoprotective actions in several types of <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> injuries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have shown earlier that PACAP treatment causes activation of protective pathways and inhibition of pro-apoptotic signaling in excitotoxic <z:hpo ids='HP_0007863'>retinal lesions</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to gain insight into the in vivo protective mechanism of PACAP in <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> hypoperfusion injury induced by bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (BCCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rats underwent BCCAO and received intravitreal PACAP (PACAP38) treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We investigated the activation level of the protective Akt pathway as well as the different <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi> activated protein kinases (MAPKs) by Western blot analysis and the expression of cytokines using a cytokine array kit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found that PACAP treatment alone did not influence the phosphorylation of Akt or the MAPKs, but decreased the hypoperfusion-induced activation of both p38MAPK and JNK and increased the activation of the protective Akt and ERK1/2 in hypoperfused retinas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cytokine profile was dramatically changed after BCCAO, with most cytokines and chemokines showing an increase, which was attenuated by PACAP (such as CINC, CNTF, fractalkine, sICAM, IL-1, LIX, Selectin, MIP-1, RANTES and TIMP-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, PACAP increased the expression of VEGF and thymus chemokine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The present results provide further insight into the neuroprotective mechanism induced by PACAP in ischemic <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> injuries, showing that PACAP ameliorates hypoperfusion injury involving Akt, MAPK pathways and anti-inflammatory actions </plain></SENT>
