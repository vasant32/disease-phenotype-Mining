<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aimed to analyze the effects of CHP on structural, mechanical, and myogenic properties of the middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) after bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (BCCAO) in adult male Wistar rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sham animals underwent a similar surgical procedure without carotid artery (CA) ligation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After 15 days of occlusion, <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> and CA were dissected and <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> structural, mechanical, and myogenic properties were assessed by pressure myography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Collagen I/III expression was determined by immunofluorescence in <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> and CA and by Western blot in CA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels for 1A1, 1A2, and 3A1 collagen subunits were quantified by quantitative real-time PCR in CA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-9, and MMP-13) and <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) protein expression were determined in CA by Western blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>BCCAO diminished cross-sectional area, wall thickness, and wall-to-lumen ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, whereas wall stress was increased, stiffness was not modified and myogenic response was diminished </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Hypoperfusion triggered HIF-1α expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Collagen I/III protein expression diminished in <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> and CA after BCCAO, despite increased <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels for 1A1 and 3A1 collagen subunits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the reduced collagen expression might be due to proteolytic degradation, since the expression of MMP-1 and MMP-9 increased in the CA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that BCCAO induces hypotrophic remodeling by a mechanism that involves a reduction of collagen I/III in association with increased MMP-1 and MMP-9 and that decreases myogenic tone in major arteries supplying the brain </plain></SENT>
