<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In decerebrate cats neurones in the region of the paramedian reticular nucleus were identified by responses to stimulation of implanted cerebellar electrodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Approximately one half were antidromically activated and one half orthodromically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Somatic stimulation and electrical stimulation of both hind limb and cranial nerves activated many of these cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between the effects of these stimuli on cell firing and on blood pressure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A number of rhythms in spontaneous firing were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One fifth of cells fired with the rhythm of efferent activity in the recurrent laryngeal nerve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In animals showing cycles of stability and instability in blood pressure corresponding phases of activity and inactivity in the firing of paramedian reticular neurones were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Most paramedian reticular cells showed bursts of firing preceding abrupt rises in blood pressure but this was also observed with cells lateral to this area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>One third of cells studied showed changes in firing rate correlated with the changes in blood pressure which followed I.V. <z:chebi fb="9" ids="15355">acetylcholine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="33569">noradrenaline</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, which always produced a rise in blood pressure, had little effect on cell firing </plain></SENT>
