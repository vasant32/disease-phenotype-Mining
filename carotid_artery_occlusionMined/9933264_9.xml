<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated cerebral formation of malondialdehyde as an index of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation in relation to different sources of reactive oxygen species in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 25 patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy, jugular venous-arterial concentration differences of brain metabolites, malondialdehyde, plasma total <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> status, and soluble P-selectin and L-selectin were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A carotid artery shunt (n=5) was placed only after complete loss of somatosensory evoked potentials, indicating a focal cerebral blood flow &lt;15 mL/min per 100 g </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: As an indication of cerebral <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation, jugular venous-arterial malondialdehyde concentration differences were significantly enhanced before reperfusion, and an additional rise was observed 15 minutes after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Plasma total <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> status significantly decreased during carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> only in patients with carotid artery shunt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This decrease was matched by cerebral formation of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="16335">adenosine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17368">hypoxanthine</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="95" ids="16301">nitrite</z:chebi>/nitrate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>While jugular venous-arterial concentration differences of soluble P-selectin showed changes similar to those of malondialdehyde, the concentration difference for soluble L-selectin was enhanced exclusively at 15 minutes after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Short-term incomplete <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>/reperfusion significantly enhanced cerebral <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation, as indicated by malondialdehyde formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The generation of reactive oxygen species by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15318,17712">xanthine</z:chebi> oxidase or nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> metabolism might be involved in the induction of <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The additional rise in cerebral release of malondialdehyde was found to coincide with a significant activation of polymorphonuclear leukocytes across the cerebral circulation </plain></SENT>
