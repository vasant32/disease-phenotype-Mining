<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A simple model of global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> in mouse is bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (BCCAo) and the neuropathological impact of BCCAo has been investigated in several mouse strains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Bilateral carotid occlusion produces extensive neuronal damage in C57Bl/6J strain mice and this damage is linked to posterior communicating artery (PcomA) hypoplasticity in the circle of Willis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we investigated the effect of BCCAo in MF1 strain mice and compared them with C57Bl/6J mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The neuropathological consequences of BCCAo were assessed using standard histochemical staining and heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) immunohistochemical staining (to demarcate cells that had been ischaemically stressed) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The effect of BCCAo on mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) was also measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The plasticity of the circle of Willis was recorded using carbon black perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MF1 mice displayed significantly less ischaemic neuronal damage and HSP70 immunoreactivity compared to C57Bl/6J mice following 10-20 min BCCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, ischaemic neuronal damage and HSP70 immunoreactivity in MF1 mice subjected to extended BCCAo (25-45 min) was never as extensive or widespread as that observed in C57Bl/6J mice after 20 min BCCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MABP in MF1 mice (102+/-5 mmHg) was significantly higher than in C57Bl/6J mice (87+/-5) during 20 min BCCAo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>MABP in MF1 mice during 20 and 40 min (103+/-12 mmHg) BCCAo remained above pre-occlusion values for the entire occlusion period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>MF1 mice had significantly greater circle of Willis plasticity (more PcomAs) than C57Bl/6J mice did </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that MF1 mice are less susceptible to BCCAo than C57Bl/6J mice and that this could be due to maintained increases in MABP during BCCAo and the lower prevalence of abnormalities of the circle of Willis in MF1 mice </plain></SENT>
