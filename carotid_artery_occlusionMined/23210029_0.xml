<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 43-year old man with a familial history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">moyamoya disease</z:e> presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Digital subtraction angiography demonstrated complete occlusion of the bilateral ICAs at the proximal portion and a ruptured <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> at the basilar artery bifurcation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Each meningeal artery supplied the anterior cranial base, but most of both hemispheres were supplied with blood from the basilar artery and the posterior cerebral arteries through a large number of collateral vessels to the ICA bifurcation as well as the anterior cerebral and middle cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The perfusion computed tomography (CT) scans with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> (ACZ) injection revealed no reduction of cerebral blood flow and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cerebrovascular reactivity to ACZ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An abdominal CT aortogram showed no other extracranial vessel abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A ruptured basilar tip <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> was successfully treated with coil embolization without complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Endovascular embolization may be a good treatment option with excellent safety for a ruptured basilar tip <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> that accompanies proximal ICA occlusion with vulnerable collateral flow </plain></SENT>
