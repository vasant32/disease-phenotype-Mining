<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Single extrastimuli increased the sympathetic discharge by 319(<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e> 43)% [from 10.3(1.7) to 36(3.7) imp.s-1, p less than 0.05] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The neural response was significantly enhanced after bilateral vagotomy by 394(34)% [from 12(2.6) to 53.3(9.8) imp.s-1, p less than 0.05], but abolished when the stimuli were delivered during bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No sympathetic reflex response was observed in cats with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> sino-aortic denervation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In eight cats, during occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery, the control sympathetic response was progressively and reversibly attenuated from 239(28)% to 36(14)%, at 90 s from the beginning of the occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After bilateral vagotomy, this inhibitory interaction was no longer present and the sympathetic neural response to programmed stimulation was maintained throughout the occlusion period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The data indicate that the sympathetic reflex response initiated by baroreceptive deactivation could be attenuated by cardiac vagal afferent activity induced by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151814" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary occlusion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
