<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Wistar rats were pretreated for 3 h by intraperitoneal 3-NPA (20 mg/kg body weight; n=13) or solvent (n=12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fifteen minutes global <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was induced by bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and hypobaric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>rCBF and tissue <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> oxygen saturation were measured by laser Doppler scanning and a microspectrophotometric method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ischemic insult and brain temperature were identical in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Body weight and neurological scores recovered in the pretreated group but further deteriorated in the non-treated group (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Quantitative histology demonstrated a better neuronal density in neocortex and hippocampal CA2, CA3, and CA4 of pretreated animals (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
