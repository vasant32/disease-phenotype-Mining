<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Animals pretreated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49023">prostaglandin inhibitors</z:chebi> showed a significant redistribution in the 'unprotected' right kidney and a minor increase in outer cortical flow fraction in the normotensive kidney </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that: (1) the increase in outer cortical flow fraction induced by CAO in the rat is due to an increase in perfusion pressure, and (2) that this redistribution is independent of sympathetic vasoconstrictor stimuli, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33567">catecholamines</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandins</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
