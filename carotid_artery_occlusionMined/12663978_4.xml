<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Nonoperative treatment of recent internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion is associated with increased recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analyzed our results of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) for treatment of symptomatic recent ICA occlusion to evaluate its feasibility, safety, and outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From 1990 to 2002, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100576'>amaurosis fugax</z:hpo>, and minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> underwent duplex ultrasound (US) scanning and arteriography to confirm the diagnosis of ICA occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Within 2 weeks of symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, patients underwent operative exploration with attempted CEA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ICA occlusion was detected at preoperative angiography and confirmed at surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with extensive ICA plaque not amenable to endarterectomy underwent external CEA with ICA ligation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Over 12 years, 87 patients with symptomatic ICA occlusion underwent 90 operations for ICA exploration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 30 patients (18 men, 12 women) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> (45%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100576'>amaurosis fugax</z:hpo> (19%), or minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (36%), CEA to treat ICA occlusion was technically successful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was 1 postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, 2 asymptomatic internal carotid occlusions, and no restenoses (mean follow-up, 26 months; range, 1-93 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 57 patients (37 men, 20 women) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> (41%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100576'>amaurosis fugax</z:hpo> (27%), or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (32%) in whom CEA was unsuccessful, external CEA was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In this group there were no postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>, 2 asymptomatic external carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusions</z:mp>, and 1 restenosis (&gt;70%) (mean follow-up, 22 months; range, 1-73 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There were no late <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> in either group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Operative exploration and endarterectomy to treat symptomatic ICA occlusion is feasible and safe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Patients with symptomatic ICA occlusion should be considered candidates for CEA </plain></SENT>
