<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Reduced blood flow produced by bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (BCAO) caused multiple histopathological alterations in the cerebral cortex of developing cats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BCAO was performed in the second postnatal week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At 1 and 2 months, global structural observations were made using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At 3 months, neuron and glial density, extent of myelination, blood vessel distribution, and the distribution of visual callosal projecting neurons (as visualized with the retrogradely transported tracer horseradish peroxidase) were assessed by light microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MRI showed lateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002119'>ventricular dilatation</z:hpo> at 1 month in five of eight subjects, with wide-ranging severity, although at 2 months only two animals still had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002119'>enlarged ventricles</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Histological observations at 3 months showed that neuron density in the motor cortex, but not the occipital cortex, of BACO animals was significantly lower than that in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>BCAO animals had more dilated small vessels, again more evident in the motor cortex than in the occipital cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>From frontal to occipital cortex, the corpus callosum was thinned and the subcortical white matter was reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Even with the reduction of white matter, the number of neurons in visual areas 17 and 18 contributing a callosal projection was much higher than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>BCAO thus altered cerebral vascularization, caused neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, and reduced myelinization over an area much greater than the direct area of carotid perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The excess callosal projection in these animals suggests that neonatal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> interferes with the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> process of axon retraction during development </plain></SENT>
