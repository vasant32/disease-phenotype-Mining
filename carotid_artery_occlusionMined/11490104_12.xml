<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To identify the most likely mechanisms of <z:mp ids='MP_0006190'>retinal ischemia</z:mp> and embolism in a hospital-referred population, and to determine the frequency of recurrent vascular events during the 3-month period following initial presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Consecutive patients presenting to 2 tertiary medical centers and their outpatient clinics were prospectively enrolled over a 22-month period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eligible patients presented with histories of transient or permanent monocular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo>, or had evidence of asymptomatic <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> embolism on routine ophthalmological examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They underwent a rapid and standardized evaluation that included imaging studies as well as blood tests, and follow-up was obtained at 1 and 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventy-seven patients were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Enrollment diagnoses consisted of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100576'>amaurosis fugax</z:hpo> (n = 32), asymptomatic <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> embolism (n = 34), and central or branch <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (n = 11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eight different presumed etiologies of <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> artery distribution embolism or hypoperfusion were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Extracranial internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> or more than 50% stenosis was observed in 17/77 (22.1%) cases, making it the largest etiologic subgroup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Uncommon but treatable conditions were identified in 8/77 (10.4%) patients, and an etiologic diagnosis could not be made in 35/77 (45.5%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Recurrent events occurred in, respectively, 14/77 (18.2%) and 6/73 (8.2%) patients at the 1- and 3-month follow-ups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>They included 2 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> and 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>; ischemic events of the retina were more common than those involving the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Severe stenosis of the extracranial internal carotid artery is the most common identified condition associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0006190'>retinal ischemia</z:mp> and embolism, but a variety of other, potentially treatable, conditions can be diagnosed if appropriate and specific evaluations are conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The frequency of recurrent vascular ischemic events is highest during the 1st month of follow-up and decreases during the 2nd and 3rd months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Recurrences range from relatively innocuous episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100576'>amaurosis fugax</z:hpo> to vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
