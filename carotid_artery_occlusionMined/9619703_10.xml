<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, in this trial the causal factors of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> were not part of the inclusion criteria and also patients with single episodes only were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report successful Excimer laser-assisted high flow EC/IC bypass surgery in a patient with frequent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tia|TIA|T.I.A.">transient ischaemic attacks</z:e> associated with a low flow state of the cerebral circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the 1.5 years after the operation the patient has never again experienced any symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Certain patients with occlusion of the internal carotid artery may benefit from EC/IC bypass surgery, in particular the Excimer laser-assisted high-flow bypass, that is, if recurrent (transient) ischaemic attacks are associated with compromised cerebral perfusion </plain></SENT>
