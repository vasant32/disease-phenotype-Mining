<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested the hypothesis that maternally administered <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> increase the expression of tight junction (TJ) proteins in the cerebral cortex of ovine fetuses with and without exposure to in utero <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fetuses at 80% of gestation were studied 18 h after the last of four 4-6 mg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> or placebo injections were given over 48 h to ewes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Groups were placebo/control, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi>/control, placebo/ischemic, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi>/ischemic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Ischemia</z:e> consisted of 30 min of fetal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and 72 h of reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cerebral cortex was snap frozen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Western immunoblot was used to measure the protein expression of occludin, claudin-1, claudin-5, zonula occludens (ZO)-1, and ZO-2, and a TJ accessory protein annexin-ll </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Occludin and annexin-ll protein expression were 48% and 58% higher (P&lt;0.05) in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi>/ischemic than placebo/control group, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Claudin-5 protein expression was 69% and 73% higher (P&lt;0.05) in the placebo/ischemic and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi>/ischemic than placebo/control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Claudin-1 expression did not differ among groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>ZO-1 protein expression was 25%, 40%, and 55% lower in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi>/control, placebo/ischemic, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi>/ischemic than placebo/control group, respectively </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We conclude that maternal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> treatment differentially regulates the expression of component proteins of TJs in the cerebral cortex of fetuses exposed to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The functional significance of this differential regulation warrants further investigation </plain></SENT>
