<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To explore the physiological mechanism of ischemic tolerance, we studied intracerebral oxygenation states noninvasively using near-infrared spectroscopy after bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (BCO) in gerbils with and without ischemic pretreatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Under <z:chebi fb="91" ids="25698">ether</z:chebi> anesthesia, gerbils with sham operation (S group, n = 8) and those with pretreatment consisting of BCO for 2 minutes, twice at 3 days and 2 days earlier (T group, n = 8), were again subjected to BCO for 5 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Changes in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7861">oxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbO2), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5656">deoxyhemoglobin</z:chebi> (Hb), and total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbT) as well as reduction in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4056">cytochrome</z:chebi> oxidase (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16040">cyt</z:chebi>.aa3) were calculated from the absorbance changes of the light transmitted through the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seven days after the ischemic study, immunohistochemical examination was performed with an antiserum against microtubule-associated proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In both groups, the increase of Hb and decrease of HbO2 and HbT proceeded rapidly after BCO, and the maximal deoxygenation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> occurred within 2.5 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Reduction of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16040">cyt</z:chebi>.aa3 also ensued rapidly and reached the maximal reduction within 3 minutes in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the T group, however, both deoxygenation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> and reduction of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16040">cyt</z:chebi>.aa3 progressed more slowly than in the S group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The time (seconds) necessary for a maximal change for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16040">cyt</z:chebi>.aa3 was significantly longer in the T group (203.8 +/- 34.0 [mean +/- SD]; P &lt; .01) than in the S group (68.0 +/- 14.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The time necessary for a half-maximal change was also significantly longer in the T group than in the S group for both Hb (22.0 +/- 7.5 and 13.5 +/- 4.0, respectively; P &lt; .05) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16040">cyt</z:chebi>.aa3 (23.9 +/- 5.7 and 11.6 +/- 4.3; P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After recirculation for 7 days, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> gerbils in the S group were found to have neuronal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in the hippocampus, while those in the T group did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The present study indicated that mild ischemic stress can induce improvement in oxygen metabolism during subsequent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, which might be causally related to the phenomenon known as "ischemic tolerance," in which a protective effect toward ischemic/postischemic injury is induced by earlier mild ischemic pretreatment </plain></SENT>
