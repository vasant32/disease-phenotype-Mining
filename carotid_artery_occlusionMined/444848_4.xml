<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The superficial temporal artery was anastomosed to a cortical branch of the middle cerebral artery in 23 cases and a vein graft inserted between the external carotid artery and the cortical vessel in 1, a microsurgical technique being used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one patients were suffering from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007787" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tia|TIA|T.I.A.">transient ischaemic attacks</z:e> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo>) and 2 had developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nineteen patients had radiologically demonstrated bilateral disease of the carotid vessels, 9 having undergone contralateral carotid artery surgery before the intracranial procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No improvement was noted in the 2 patients with developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo>; one patient developed a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> contralateral to the intracranial procedure 24 h postoperatively, this being accompanied by occlusion of the anastomoses, and one patient had progression of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> syndrome following occlusion of the intracranial vein graft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> other patients have shown a reduction of abolition of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> over a follow-up period of 24 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that intracranial revascularization is of value in patients with total internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and continuing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIAs</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
