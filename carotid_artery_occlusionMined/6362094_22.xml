<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In order to relate clinical, angiologic and brain-morphological findings, 107 patients with internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> were examined clinically and by Doppler sonography, computerized tomography and cerebral angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During computerized tomography, haemodynamically induced infarctions could be differentiated from those, caused by periocclusive embolism towards the major brain arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This differentiation was based on an integration of angiological as well as brain-morphological data and implicates some important diagnostic, therapeutic and prognostic consequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The first group may benefit from immediate surgical restoration of carotid blood flow and have a relatively good prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By contrast, subjects presenting territorial infarctions mostly experience severe and permanent neurological deficits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They should not undergo revascularization since endarterectomy increases the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> but cannot cause clinical improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In five patients, following special angiographic techniques, the lesions of the internal carotid artery turned out to be pseudoocclusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This condition threatens the patient considerably but is well accessible to surgical reconstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, pseudooclusion seems to be one of the most convincing indication for emergency endarterectomy of the internal carotid artery </plain></SENT>
