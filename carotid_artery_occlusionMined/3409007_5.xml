<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Systolic arterial blood pressure at rest was significantly higher in male SHR (228 +/- 13 mm Hg, mean +/- S.E.M.) than female (192 +/- 12) (P less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The average survival time during permanent occlusion was 11 +/- 6 h (mean +/- S.D.) in male SHR and 17 +/- 7 in female (P less than 0.005), though the cumulative mortality during 24-h <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was not different between male (88%) and female SHR (84%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Severe ischemic changes of nerve cells in the brain, especially in the cortex and hippocampus, were observed in 50% of male SHR at 3-h <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, while only 15% was observed in female SHR even after 7-h <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After the temporary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> followed by reperfusion for 24 h, the mortality was varied between male and female SHR; 0, 31 and 100% after 1-, 3- and 5-h <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, respectively, in male SHR and 0% after 1- to 3-h <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and 33% after 5- to 7-h <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, respectively, in female </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ischemic changes of the brain tissue, such as acidophilic cytoplasm, nuclear degeneration and intercellular <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>, were more frequent and severe in male SHR than female after recirculation following 3- or 5-h <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the mortality and post-ischemic viability seem to be determined by the duration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and also by the degree of the neuronal damage, and female SHR is more tolerated for ischemic insult in comparison to male SHR </plain></SENT>
