<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Not only the STA itself, but also ophthalmic and major aortocranial arteries were recorded by the Doppler technique in 12 patients who had undergone STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> anastomosis for internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> or stenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The examination was performed before, and within a month after the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The blood flow pattern of the STA, which had had an external carotid flow pattern, was altered to an internal carotid flow pattern by the STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> bypass operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The findings of Doppler sonograms of the STA were exactly consistent with post-operative angiograms and precisely represented the bypass patency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among 7 patients with reverse flow direction in the ophthalmic artery before the operation, the reverse flow had decreased in 5 patients post-operatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>But no remarkable change in the ophthalmic artery was detected in the remaining 2 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The blood flow velocity patterns of major aortocranial arteries showed no change post-operatively </plain></SENT>
