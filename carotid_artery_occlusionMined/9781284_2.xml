<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Reports studying the combination of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>low blood pressure</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> are few, and it remains to be determined how cerebral circulatory insufficiency modifies the cerebral perfusion and the central haemodynamic response to blood loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesised that occlusion of arteries to the brain modifies the cerebrovascular and cardiovascular responses to blood loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Continuous measurements of the cerebral microcirculation with laser Doppler microprobes in the cerebral cortex were performed in anaesthetised pigs during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> and haemorrhagic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The response to rapid <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> (25% of the blood volume) was recorded during <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> conditions and during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> induced by bilateral occlusion of the common carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> conditions haemorrhage caused insignificant decreases in cerebral microcirculation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Haemorrhage during bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, however, caused significantly greater changes in cerebral microcirculation and a greater posthaemorrhagic increase in cerebrovascular resistance shortly after the blood loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Haemorrhage during bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> also caused greater reductions in cardiac output and arterial pressure than similar blood loss caused during <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study showed a disproportionate decrease in cerebral blood flow with haemorrhage during bilateral carotid occlusion, caused by an immediate increase in cerebrovascular resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that even a moderate blood loss in patients with impaired cerebral circulation could be dangerous, because <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> compensatory mechanisms to haemorrhage are impaired </plain></SENT>
