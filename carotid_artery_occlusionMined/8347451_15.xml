<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A technique for remotely controlling the degree of carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in the gerbil model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0917798" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral ischaemia</z:e> has been developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The technique relies on manually adjustable nylon snares around the carotid arteries, in conjunction with a computer-based monitoring system, to control the degree of occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This has allowed us to determine the dependence of energy metabolism (as assessed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37971">31P</z:chebi> NMR spectroscopy) on blood flow in greater detail than was possible in our previous studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data obtained show that energy changes first appear at flows of 25-30 mL/100 g/min, while at flows below 20 mL/100 g/min there is a major derangement of energy metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The model was used to determine the sensitivity of cerebral energy metabolism to reduced cerebral blood flow under normothermic conditions and in mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> (30 degrees C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>Hypothermia</z:hpo> had a protective effect in that energy metabolites were maintained at flows significantly below the normothermic threshold </plain></SENT>
