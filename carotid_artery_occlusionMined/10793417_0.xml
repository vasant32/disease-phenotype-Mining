<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent advances in magnetic resonance imaging apparatus and the related software have made possible obtaining multi-voxel 1H-MRS in a single study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined multi-voxel 1H-MRS in patients with unilateral internal carotid artery(ICA) occlusion to study the relationship between cerebral metabolism and cerebral blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients(male 11; female 4, 47-76; average 67.1 year-old) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> unilateral ICA occlusion and without any marked infarction were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>1H-MRS was obtained using a 1.5 T Siemens Magnetom Vision scanner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multi-voxel spectra were recorded using a SE-2 D-CSI sequence(TR/TE = 1500/135 ms) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The volume of interest was 90 x 90 x 20 mm3, placed axially above the lateral ventricle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The single voxel size was 10 x 10 x 20 mm3 </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The regional cerebral blood flow(CBF) was measured by <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">Xenon</z:chebi>-CT method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Eight patients were also examined by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> challenge to evaluate the cerebrovascular reserve capacity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>/Cr ratios in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects were 1.905 +/- 0.090(mean +/- standard deviation) in the cortex and 2.183 +/- 0.258 in the white matter in 40's(n = 6), 2.046 +/- 0.166 in the cortex and 2.039 +/- 0.288 in the white matter in 60's(n = 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The study revealed 7 patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>/Cr ratio and CBF, 5 with reduced <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>/Cr ratio and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CBF, and 3 with reduced <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>/Cr ratio and CBF in the affected cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A low correlation coefficient of 0.46 was noted between <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>/Cr ratio and the cerebrovascular reserve capacity calculated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> challenge in the affected cortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In the range of less than +10%(lower limit) in percentile change of regional CBF after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi> injection, <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>/Cr ratio was distributed between 1.600 and 2.044, which were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or slightly under the lower limit(mean-2 x standard deviation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Multi-voxel 1H-MRS is useful for the evaluation of cerebral metabolism, because it enables to quantify different chemicals in many fields at one time and to compare its distribution with regional CBF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In patients with unilateral ICA occlusion, <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>/Cr ratio of the affected cortex varies depending on the collateral circulation and the contralateral ICA lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The Extracranial-Intracranial Bypass should be considered if the case with unilateral ICA occlusion reveals reduced CBF and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or slightly decreased <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>/Cr ratio in the affected cortex </plain></SENT>
