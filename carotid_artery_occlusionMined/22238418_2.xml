<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine whether unihemispheral hemodynamic failure is independently associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> among participants in the National Institute of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112108" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Neurological Disorders</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo>-sponsored, multicenter, randomized clinical trial, Randomized Evaluation of Carotid Occlusion and Neurocognition (RECON) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-three patients were randomized into RECON after recent symptomatic carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and asymmetrically increased oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) by PET (OEF ratio &gt;1.13), indicating stage II hemodynamic failure on the side of occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The PET-positive patients were compared with 28 RECON-enrolled patients who met <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> clinical and radiographic inclusion/exclusion criteria but had no OEF asymmetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A multivariable regression compared patients with PET OEF &gt;1.13 or â‰¤1.13, stratifying by <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> vs. <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> as the qualifying event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The dependent variable was a composite neurocognitive score derived from averaging age-normalized z scores on a test battery that included global and internal carotid artery (ICA) side-relevant hemisphere-specific tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were no differences in demographic, clinical, or radiologic characteristics between the PET-positive and PET-negative patients except for PET OEF asymmetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The unadjusted average neurocognitive z score was -1.45 for the PET-positive and -1.25 for the PET-negative patients, indicating <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> in both groups but no difference between them (p = 0.641) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for age, education, side of occlusion, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, and previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, there was a significant difference between PET-positive and PET-negative patients among those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> as a qualifying event (average z score = -1.41 vs. -0.76, p = 0.040) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Older age and right ICA side were also significant in this model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Hemodynamic failure is independently associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> in patients with carotid occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This finding establishes the physiologic parameter upon which the extracranial-intracranial bypass will be tested </plain></SENT>
