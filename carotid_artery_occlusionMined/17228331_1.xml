<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Although interneurons in area CA1 of the hippocampus are less vulnerable to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> than CA1 pyramidal cells, it is not clear whether their relatively intact cellular <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> implies preservation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As maintenance of cellular excitability and firing properties is essential for interneurons to regulate neural networks, we investigated these aspects of interneuronal function after transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>Cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> in rats was induced for 8 mins by a combination of bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and hypovolemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo>, and whole cell patch clamp recordings were made in hippocampal slices prepared 24 h after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Interneurons located within stratum pyramidale of area CA1 exhibited <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> membrane properties and action potentials under these conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, their excitability had declined, as evidenced by an increased action potential threshold and a rightward shift in the relationship between injected depolarizing current and firing rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Voltage-clamp experiments revealed that transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> reduced the peak <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi> current and shifted <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi> channel activation to more depolarized values, but did not alter steady-state inactivation of the channel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Double immunofluorescence cytochemistry showed that transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> also reduced Na(v)1.1 subunit immunoreactivity in interneurons that coexpressed parvalbumin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> renders CA1 interneurons less excitable, that depressed excitability involves impaired <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi> channel activation and that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29101">Na(+)</z:chebi> channel dysfunction is explained, at least in part, by reduced expression of the Na(v)1.1 subunit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These changes may promote interneuron survival, but might also contribute to pyramidal cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
