<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Global <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was produced by 10 or 30-min occlusion of both common carotid arteries which was done 24 hr after the permanent electrocauterization of bilateral vertebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The rCBF was measured using the radioactive microsphere technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In rats subjected to 10-min <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, rCBF in 9 brain regions was reduced to 11.3-54.8% (mean: 26.9%) of that of the sham operated control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ten min after recirculation, hyperperfusion was observed in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus and striatum, and a moderate recovery was detected in the n.accumb. + olfactory tub., thalamus and hypothalamus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, rCBF in these 6 regions was again decreased 20-30 min later, and it recovered to levels more than 50% of the control 60 min after the ischemic event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the other 3 regions (cerebellum, colliculus sup. + inf., pons + medulla), rCBF increased toward the control level gradually, and it completely recovered 60 min after recirculation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, in rats subjected to 30-min <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>, rCBF in 9 brain regions was reduced to 1.77-26.3% (mean: 9.6%) of that of the control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The post-ischemic hyperperfusion in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus and a moderate recovery of rCBF in the striatum and n.accumb. + olfactory tub. were observed 10 min after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, rCBF in these 4 regions remained under the control levels from 20 to 60 min after recirculation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
