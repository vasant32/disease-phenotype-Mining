<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Ninety-four asymptomatic patients with internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> were followed for a mean of 44 months, 16% suffered <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> and 11.7% reported <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The annual <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> rates were 4.4% and 3.2%, respectively, the annual mortality was 11.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 27 asymptomatic patients progression of extracranial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852949" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">arterial disease</z:e> to occlusion was observed: 7.4% of these patients suffered from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and 18.5% reported <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo>'s during that period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus the annual <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate was lower (1.9%) but the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>TIA</z:hpo> rate higher (4.7%) than post-occlusive rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These data reflect an increase risk in patients with progressive high-degree <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> which continues after occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This may favour carotid endarterectomy for selected patients in the pre-occlusive state because medical treatment has not been shown to prevent progression of stenosis to occlusion </plain></SENT>
