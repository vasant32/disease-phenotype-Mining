<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After the first month, mortality on an actuarial basis was 3% per year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Survival at 5 years was 84% in comparison with an expected survival of 89% for persons of comparable age and sex in a general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among the 25 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> that occurred during follow-up, 2 were due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and 16 to cardiac causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of 28 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> that occurred, 5 occurred during operation or that same day, and 3 others occurred within 30 days postoperatively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thereafter, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> occurred at the rate of 2.5% per year on an actuarial basis; a third of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> occurred contralateral to the surgical site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No difference was found in survival or in survival free of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> among patients who had proven carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (N = 157), carotid siphon stenosis (N = 53), or <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> stenosis or occlusion (N = 29) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In regard to the probability of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, this group of patients compares favorably with population studies of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attacks</z:hpo> of undetermined cause </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When this surgical group was compared with 130 nonsurgical patients who had had ischemic symptoms related to proven internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> between 1965 and 1975, however, we could not conclude that the risk of occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> was less in patients who had STA-<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> bypass than in the nonsurgical patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
