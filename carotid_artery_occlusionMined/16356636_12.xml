<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined the early <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the ischemic hippocampus after 30 min of bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in C57BL/6J <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (WT) and TNF-alpha, IL-1alpha/beta or IL-6 gene knockout (KO) mice utilizing real-time polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expressions of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha, IL-6 and IL-1beta were significantly induced in ischemic WT mice compared with in the sham-operated mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These increases peaked at 3 to 24 h for TNF-alpha, at 12 h for IL-1beta, and at 6 to 24 h for IL-6 after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The pattern of temporal expression of the cytokine <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> in ischemic gene KO mice, however, differed from that in WT mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The TNF-alpha <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression showed a similar temporal expression pattern in IL-6 KO mice compared to in WT mice following ischemic reperfusion, and the levels at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> time points were lower than in WT mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The IL-1beta <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level was very low in ischemic TNF-alpha KO mice and IL-6 KO mice in spite of a small peak observed in both at 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The IL-6 mRNA level was significantly upregulated at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> time points in both ischemic WT and TNF-alpha KO mice; however, the peak was delayed by 12-h in IL-1alpha/beta KO mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the present study indicates that the rapid increases in cytokine levels are interdependent, interactive, and possibly modulate each other in the mouse hippocampus after transient global <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
