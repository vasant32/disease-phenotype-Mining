<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The circle of Willis is regarded as the major source of collateral flow in patients with severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present study was to assess whether the presence of border zone <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> is related to the collateral ability of the circle of Willis in symptomatic (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo>, minor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>) and asymptomatic patients with unilateral occlusion of the internal carotid artery (ICA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty-one patients (35 symptomatic, 16 asymptomatic) and 53 control subjects were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients had unilateral occlusion of the ICA and contralateral ICA stenosis between 0% and 69% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The directions of flow, on the side of the ICA occlusion, and the size of the component vessels in the circle of Willis were investigated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: On average, 92% of the patients without border zone <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (n=26) had willisian collateral flow compared with 60% of patients with border zone <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (n=25; P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This increase in collateral flow was caused by the high prevalence of collateral flow via the posterior communicating artery in patients without border zone <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> (50% versus 12%; P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No statistically significant relation was found between the pattern of collateral flow via the circle of Willis and the presence of clinical symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, asymptomatic patients with ICA occlusion demonstrated an increased diameter of the anterior communicating artery (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients with unilateral ICA occlusion, the presence of collateral flow via the posterior communicating artery in the circle of Willis is associated with a low prevalence of border zone <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarcts</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Asymptomatic patients with an ICA occlusion do not have an increased collateral function of the circle of Willis </plain></SENT>
