<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AMPA receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> activity resided in the (-) isomers, LY300164 and LY303070, which were effective given electrophoretically, intravenously (2.5-5 mg/kg) or orally (10 mg/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The same stereoselectivity was observed in neuroprotection studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, systemic administration of the (-) isomer, but not the (+) isomer, of these 2,3-<z:chebi fb="13" ids="22720">benzodiazepines</z:chebi> before or immediately after bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in the gerbil was neuroprotective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For example, 10 mg/kg of LY300164 intraperitoneally or orally provided survival of up to 25% of hippocampal CA1 neurones </plain></SENT>
