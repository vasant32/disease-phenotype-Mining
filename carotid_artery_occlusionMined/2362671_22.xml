<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ten of the 20 ICCAAns were asymptomatic at diagnosis, and 10 were symptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three of the asymptomatic ICCAAns were symptomatic at follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One of these required clipping because of a progressing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0271347" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cavernous sinus syndrome</z:e>; the other 2 were minimally symptomatic and have not required treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the 10 initially symptomatic ICCAAns, 2 had not changed, 4 became more symptomatic, and 4 had symptomatically improved by follow-up </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the 4 ICCAAns that became more symptomatic, 2 continue to be monitored, and 2 required intervention: one with detachable balloon occlusion of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> with preservation of the internal carotid artery lumen, and the other with gradual cervical internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The clinical course of this selected group of patients with ICCAAns suggests that the natural history of ICCAAns can be quite variable </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therapeutic intervention for asymptomatic ICCAAns should be reserved for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> arising at the anterior genu of the carotid siphon and/or extending into the subarachnoid space, where <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> is most likely </plain></SENT>
