<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> of 17 min followed by reperfusion for 24h was employed in present study to produce <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and reperfusion induced cerebral injury in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cerebral <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size was measured using triphenyltetrazolium <z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Memory was evaluated using elevated plus-maze test and <z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water maze</z:mp> test </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three preceding episodes of bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> for 1 min and reperfusion of 1 min were employed to elicit ischemic preconditioning of brain, while three episodes of bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> for 10s and reperfusion of 10s immediately after the completion of were employed to elicit ischemic postconditioning of brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both prior ischemic preconditioning as well as ischemic postconditioning immediately after global <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> prevented markedly <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion-induced cerebral injury as measured in terms of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> size, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002622,C0751295" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction;Sign or Symptom" abbrv="">loss of memory</z:e> and motor coordination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RS 102895, a selective CCR-2 chemokine receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi>, attenuated the neuroprotective effect of both the ischemic preconditioning as well as postconditioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the neuroprotective effect of both ischemic preconditioning as well as ischemic postconditioning may involve the activation of CCR-2 chemokine receptors </plain></SENT>
