<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Extracranial-intracranial bypass surgery provides blood flow augmentation in patients suffering from intracranial or long-distance conductance <z:mp ids='MP_0006135'>artery stenosis</z:mp> or occlusion that otherwise cannot be treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The standard procedure for these cases is an anastomosis between the superficial temporal and middle cerebral arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, in patients presenting with common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, the superficial temporal artery is no longer sufficiently perfused </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For these patients, alternative revascularization strategies have to be applied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To describe a novel strategy for revascularization of patients with common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, ie, the extracranial posterior communicating artery bypass </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> cerebrovascular compromise resulting in transitory ischemic attacks and/or border-zone infarctions caused by common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> were referred to our institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A radial artery bypass was established between the third segment of the vertebral artery and an M3 branch of the middle cerebral artery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The vertebral artery was exposed between the vertebral lamina of C1 and occipital bone via a paramedian incision </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The bypass was tunneled subcutaneously, conducted intracranially via a tailored extended burr-hole craniotomy, and anastomosed to a recipient M3 vessel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The postoperative course of both patients was uneventful in terms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> or <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In both patients, postoperative angiographic controls revealed an excellent bypass function with markedly improved hemispheric filling of multiple middle cerebral artery branches </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The patients were discharged without new neurological symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our extracranial posterior communicating artery bypass using a radial artery transplant from the vertebral artery to the middle cerebral artery is a useful tool to treat patients suffering from hemodynamic cerebrovascular compromise caused by common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
