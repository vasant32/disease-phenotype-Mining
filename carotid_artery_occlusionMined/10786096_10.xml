<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Endovascular occlusion or trapping of the ICA with or without an extracranial-intracranial bypass is sometimes performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the results of the long-term follow up of 11 patients with a giant or large cavernous sinus <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> treated by only proximal occlusion between 1975 and 1989 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Proximal occlusion of the carotid artery was performed by Selverstone clamping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The follow-up period ranged from 6 to 21 years (mean 13.9 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eight of the 11 patients showed improvement of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006824'>cranial nerves paresis</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, and four became asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>None of the original <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> ruptured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The final outcomes were nine good recovery, one moderately disabled, and one severely disabled by the Glasgow Outcome Scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The causes of morbidity were early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> from a newly formed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Late complications included <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> in two patients, and new formation and enlargement of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> at a site other than the original <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> in two patients, 13 and 17 years later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Therapeutic carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> requires strict test ICA occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In addition, long-term follow up by periodical cerebral angiography using magnetic resonance, computed tomography, or digital subtraction angiography is necessary, and postoperative medical treatment is important to reduce the risk of late complications </plain></SENT>
