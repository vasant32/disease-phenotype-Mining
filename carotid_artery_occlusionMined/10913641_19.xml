<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To investigate the expression of nitric <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> synthase (NOS) in the ischemic retina </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:mp ids='MP_0006190'>Retinal ischemia</z:mp> was induced in rats by bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (BCCAO) for various lengths of time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using the retina after BCCAO, expression of neuronal NOS (nNOS) and inducible NOS (iNOS) and identification of their positive cells were studied by histological and immunohistochemical examinations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Histological examinations revealed significant reduction in the thickness of the inner plexiform layer and the outer plexiform layer of the retina </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Expression of nNOS was detected in <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> ganglion cells, amacrine cells, and Müller cells after BCCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The expression of nNOS and iNOS detected in Müller cells became stronger and persisted long after BCCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In the ischemic retina, Müller cells and <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> ganglion cells expressed nNOS and iNOS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These phenomena may be involved in the ischemic damage to the retina </plain></SENT>
