<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, the role of leukocytes as mediators of secondary brain damage after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> has been discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to examine the effects of moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> on leukocyte-endothelium interaction in the rat pial microvasculature after transient middle cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (MCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Methods--<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52672">Rhodamine 6G</z:chebi>-labeled leukocytes in brain surface were visualized with intravital fluorescence videomicroscopy through a closed cranial window </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the number of leukocytes adhering to the venular and arteriolar endothelium before ischemic insult and up to 3 hours after reperfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rats were divided into 4 experimental groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Group I (n=6) consisted of sham-operated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Groups II (n=6) and III (n=6) received left MCAO for 1 hour under normothermia (36 degrees C to 37 degrees C, group II) and under moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> (30 degrees C to 32 degrees C, group III) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Group IV (n=4) received left common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> for 1 hour under normothermia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Results--The number of adhering leukocytes in venules in groups II and IV increased significantly (P&lt;0.001) after reperfusion compared with the group I, but that in group III did not increase significantly (P&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The number of adhering leukocytes in arterioles in group II increased significantly (P&lt;0.01) compared with the other groups, although the adhering leukocytes were not as numerous as those seen in venules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Conclusions--It is demonstrated that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> attenuates adhering leukocytes in venules and arterioles after reperfusion of MCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The inhibition of the leukocyte function may be an important factor in the neuroprotective effect of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002045'>hypothermia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
