<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eight-month-old male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent permanent bilateral occlusion of the carotid arteries (2VO) or sham surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At 7 days postsurgery, animals from these groups were randomly assigned to undergo CMStress consisting of relatively mild stressor exposure 6 days a week for 6 weeks or a no-stress regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They were perfused 24 h thereafter and stereology was used to estimate the total number of hippocampal CA1 and CA3 pyramidal cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) immunoreactivity in the hippocampus was also measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Degenerating neurons were quantified with the Fluoro-Jade B staining technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CMStress significantly potentiated CA1 cell loss in 2VO rats (17% loss), compared to a 7% loss of CA1 cells in nonstressed 2VO rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CMStress had no effect on CA3 cell number </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CMStress also caused a significant reduction in GFAP-immunoreactive astrocyte density in CA1, CA3, and the hilus of both sham and 2VO rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Fluoro-Jade staining was absent, indicating that cell loss probably occurred in the early stage of combined 2VO and CMStress </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It was concluded that CMStress exacerbates the consequences of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1695782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral hypoperfusion</z:e> on CA1 probably by reducing astrocytes, thereby increasing extracellular <z:chebi fb="6" ids="14321,29987">glutamate</z:chebi> and/or diminishing free radical defense systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings have particular relevance to understanding the contribution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> stress to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002395" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="SDAT">Alzheimer's disease</z:e>, which, in its premorbid stage, is characterized by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1695782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral hypoperfusion</z:e>, and, in its clinical stage, is characterized by CA1 cell loss </plain></SENT>
