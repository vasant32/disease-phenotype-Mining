<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Many studies have reported the benefits of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) contralateral to an occluded internal carotid artery (ICA), with varying results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study analyzed perioperative and late outcomes in a recent trial in which patients were randomized to carotid eversion endarterectomy (CEE) or traditional CEA with patching (CEAP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: In 336 primary CEAs (310 patients) 68 were contralateral to an occluded ICA (group I) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The remaining 268 CEAs served as control group (group II) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent clinical follow-up and duplex ultrasonography at 1, 6, and 12 months and every year thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Endpoints of the study were early and late neurological events, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Group I had a significantly higher incidence of perioperative electroencephalic changes and need for shunting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> rate in group I was almost three times as high as in group II, but the difference was not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Similarly, the perioperative minor neurological event and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rates, as with the cumulative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-free and survival rates at 1, 3, and 5 years, were comparable in the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CEA contralateral to an occluded ICA can be implemented with perioperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and mortality rates and late <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-free and survival rates comparable to CEA with no contralateral ICA occlusion </plain></SENT>
