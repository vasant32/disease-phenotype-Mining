<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Unilateral WS infarctions have sometimes been reported in occlusion of the ipsilateral internal carotid artery (ICA), but their pathogenesis and prognostic implications are poorly known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six of 154 (17%) consecutive patients with ICA occlusion had a computed tomography-proved ipsilateral WS <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Severe active <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>syncope</z:hpo> (p less than 0.0001), severe contralateral ICA disease (p less than 0.001), and elevated venous hematocrit values (p less than 0.001) related to heavy smoking were more frequent in the patients with WS infarction than in other patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Delayed infarctions in the territory of the main branches of the middle cerebral artery distal to the ICA occlusion correlated with a visible stump or emboligenic changes (ulcerated or irregular stenosis) on the collateral channels, but this was not true for delayed WS infarctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that most of the WS infarctions were hemodynamic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patients with WS <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> had a higher <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate (9.9% per year) than did the patients without WS <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> (2.3% per year), suggesting that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e> should be particularly closely managed in patients with WS infarctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As WS infarctions were the most frequent type of infarction distal to an occluded ICA, appropriate treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> potential causes of systemic hemodynamic disturbances may be crucial in the long-term management of patients with ICA occlusion </plain></SENT>
