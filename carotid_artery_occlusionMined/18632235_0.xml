<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To summarize our preliminary experiences regarding HydroCoil occlusion for the treatment of carotid-cavernous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> (CCF), and to evaluate the effectiveness of this treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From January 2006 to June 2007, 15 patients with traumatic CCF who were treated using HydroCoil occlusion were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients presented with symptoms such as intracranial pulsatile noise, bulbar <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0155169" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">conjunctival hyperemia</z:e>, and pulsatile <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015300" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">exophthalmia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cerebral angiography revealed that the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> was located in the right internal carotid-cavernous segment in 6 cases, in the left internal carotid-cavernous segment in 8 cases, and on both sides in 1 case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After CCF procedure, in 15 patients, the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_70'>fistula</z:mpath> was no longer visualized, the internal carotid artery on the affected side remained patent, and intracranial noise disappeared immediately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The preoperative symptoms <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015300" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">exophthalmia</z:e>, bulbar <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0155169" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">conjunctival hyperemia</z:e>, etc., returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> 1 week after the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Vision recovered to varying extents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the 9 patients who underwent 1-3 months of follow-up cerebral angiography, CCF recurrences and neurological complications were not observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Intravascular occlusion has been widely used for CCF treatment, and detachable balloon embolization remains the preferred treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the case of failure of detachable balloon embolization because the patient cannot tolerate the procedure or internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> on the affected side is contraindicated, HydroCoil occlusion is a safe and effective though expensive alternative and a stable method of maintaining high carotid artery patency </plain></SENT>
