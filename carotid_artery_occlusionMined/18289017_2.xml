<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the study examined whether 2-VO altered the expression patterns of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and nerve growth factor (NGF) in the hippocampus of rats and whether angelica injections attenuated the alteration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rats were divided into four groups to receive either 2-VO surgery or sham surgery followed by either angelica injections or saline injections for eight weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Spatial learning in <z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water maze</z:mp> and the expression patterns of BDNF and NGF in the hippocampus of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> rats were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results showed that 2-VO significantly impaired spatial learning and memory, and angelica injections significantly reversed the learning and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairment</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, 2-VO resulted in significantly decreased BDNF protein, NGF protein, and NGF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression in the hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Angelica injections significantly attenuated the decreased expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, spatial learning in <z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water maze</z:mp> was positively correlated to the expression of BDNF and NGF in the hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, angelica injections might alleviate <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> during <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1695782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral hypoperfusion</z:e> through BDNF and NGF </plain></SENT>
