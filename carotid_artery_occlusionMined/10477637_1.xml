<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The natural history of hemodynamically significant (internal carotid systolic velocity more than 125 cm/s) early recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> was studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Recurrent hemodynamically significant stenosis occurred within 24 months in 49 internal carotid arteries (45 patients) after 883 endarterectomies (5.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These patients were then examined with serial scans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subsequent redo endarterectomy and neurological events were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients were observed for 9 to 84 months (mean, 53 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Arteries with recurrent stenosis were grouped according to the maximal velocity recorded: group I, systolic velocity more than 125 cm/s and less than 280 cm/s (12); group II, systolic velocity more than 280 cm/s or diastolic velocity more than 80 cm/s (21); group III, systolic velocity more than 280 cm/s and diastolic velocity more than 120 cm/s (14); group IV, internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean time to a velocity of more than 125 cm/s was 11 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean time to peak velocity was 16 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During The Follow-UP Period, Five Stenoses Remained Stable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Nineteen Continued To Increase, With Two Eventual Asymptomatic Occlusions (4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Six Recurrences Ultimately Had Redo Endarterectomy, Two For Symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Three Of These Developed New Secondary Recurrent Lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, In 25 Arteries (53%), The Velocity Profile Decreased By At Least One Group Classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The Mean Time To The Lowest Velocity (TTL) Was 50 Months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Systolic Velocity Ultimately Fell Below 125 Cm/S In 13 Stenoses (SIX In Group I; Five In Group II; Two In Group III) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Early recurrent hemodynamically significant stenosis is unusual and rarely progresses to occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Even critical stenosis can regress to within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> limits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Redo endarterectomy is seldom necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The challenge remains to define which patients are at risk for symptoms and occlusion </plain></SENT>
