<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To evaluate stable <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi>-enhanced CT cerebral blood flow with balloon test occlusion as a predictor of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> risk in internal carotid artery sacrifice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Abrupt internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> was performed by surgical or endovascular means below the origin of the ophthalmic artery in 31 normotensive patients who were assessed preoperatively by a 15-minute clinical balloon test occlusion followed by an internal carotid artery-occluded <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi> CT cerebral blood flow study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One patient, who passed the clinical test occlusion but exhibited regions of cerebral blood flow less than 30 mL/100 g per minute on the occlusion <z:chebi fb="3" ids="49957">xenon</z:chebi> CT cerebral blood flow study went on to have a fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> corresponding exactly to the region of reduced blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty patients passed both components of the preoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-risk assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neuroimaging demonstrated possible flow-related infarctions, which subsequently developed in three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two patients were asymptomatic, and one patient was left with a mild residual <z:hpo ids='HP_0001269'>hemiparesis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our protocol provided a statistically significant reduction in subsequent infarction rate and infarction-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate when compared with a control group of normotensive abrupt internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> patients who did not undergo any preoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>-risk assessment (reported in the literature) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The estimated false-negative rate for our preoperative assessment protocol ranged from 3.3% to 10% depending on the assessment of the cause of the three potentially flow-related infarctions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although life-threatening major vascular territory infarctions have been avoided, our protocol is less sensitive to changes predicting smaller, often minimally symptomatic, vascular border zone infarctions and does not predict postoperative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001727'>thromboembolic strokes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
