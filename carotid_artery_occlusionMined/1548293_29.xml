<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In situ hybridization was used to estimate regional levels of heat shock protein-70 (<z:chebi fb="24" ids="50430">HSP</z:chebi>-70) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and c-fos <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in two related models of focal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the first model, permanent occlusion of the distal middle cerebral artery (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi>) alone caused a patchy increase in <z:chebi fb="24" ids="50430">HSP</z:chebi>-70 mRNA by 1 h in the central zone of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory of the ipsilateral neocortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Tissue levels of <z:chebi fb="24" ids="50430">HSP</z:chebi>-70 mRNA continued to increase for several hours and remained elevated at 24 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast to the focal expression of <z:chebi fb="24" ids="50430">HSP</z:chebi>-70, c-fos <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was increased throughout the ipsilateral cerebral cortex by 15 min and remained elevated for least 3 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The wide distribution of c-fos expression suggests it may have been caused by spreading <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the second model, severe focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was produced with a combination of transient (1-h) bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and permanent <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Combined occlusion for 1 h without reperfusion caused expression of <z:chebi fb="24" ids="50430">HSP</z:chebi>-70 mRNA only in regions adjacent to the central zone of the <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> territory of the neocortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, reperfusion of the carotids for 2 h generated intense expression of <z:chebi fb="24" ids="50430">HSP</z:chebi>-70 mRNA throughout most of the ipsilateral cerebral cortex, white matter, striatum, and hippocampus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The wide-spread increase in <z:chebi fb="24" ids="50430">HSP</z:chebi>-70 mRNA suggests that reperfusion triggered expression in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> previously ischemic regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, at 24 h of reperfusion, increased levels of <z:chebi fb="24" ids="50430">HSP</z:chebi>-70 mRNA were restricted primarily to the ischemic core of the neocortex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that expression of <z:chebi fb="24" ids="50430">HSP</z:chebi>-70 mRNA is prolonged in regions undergoing injury, but is transient in surrounding regions that recover </plain></SENT>
