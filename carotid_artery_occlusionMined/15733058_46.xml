<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this work was to evaluate FXI and FIX as potential therapeutic targets by means of a refined <z:chebi fb="2" ids="30808">ferric chloride</z:chebi> (FeCl(3))-induced arterial injury model in factor-deficient mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Various concentrations of FeCl(3) were used to establish the <z:hpo ids='HP_0004420'>arterial thrombosis</z:hpo> model in C57BL/6 mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Carotid artery blood flow was completely blocked within 10 min in C57BL/6 mice by application of 3.5% FeCl(3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, FXI- and FIX-deficient mice were fully protected from occlusion induced by 5% FeCl(3), and were partially protected against the effect of 7.5% FeCl(3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The protective effect was comparable to very high doses of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> (1000 units kg(-1)) and substantially more effective than aspirin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>While FXI and FIX deficiencies were indistinguishable in the carotid artery injury model, there was a marked difference in a tail-<z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>-time assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>FXI-deficient and <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice have similar <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> times, while FIX deficiency was associated with severely <z:hpo ids='HP_0003010'>prolonged bleeding times</z:hpo> (&gt;5.8-fold increase, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Given the relatively mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001892'>bleeding diathesis</z:hpo> associated with FXI deficiency, therapeutic inhibition of FXI may be a reasonable strategy for treating or preventing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0302148,C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">thrombus</z:e> formation </plain></SENT>
