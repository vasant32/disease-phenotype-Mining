<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Seven sham-operated littermates served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They were sacrificed at 3 months of age, and their brains were examined macro- and microscopically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neuropathological examination revealed dilated posterior communicating and basilar arteries in bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (BCAO) animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Six out of 7 BCAO brains had uni- or multiloculated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_62'>cysts</z:mpath> in the periventricular white matter which were surrounded by a band of GFAP-positive glial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Scattered small areas of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002171'>gliosis</z:hpo> were found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> experimental animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four BCAO brains also showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002119'>ventricular dilatation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although the cerebral cortex seemed to be intact, the periventricular white matter and the corpus callosum were reduced in width in experimental animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Myelination in the white matter was significantly reduced in BCAO animals compared with the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study directly demonstrates that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1695782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral hypoperfusion</z:e> alone can produce <z:hpo ids='HP_0006970'>periventricular leukomalacia</z:hpo> in neonatal dogs </plain></SENT>
