<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Male Mongolian gerbils were subjected to bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> for 5 min and killed at increasing times post-occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The well-characterized delayed CAl pyramidal cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was observed 5-7 days post-occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At post-occlusion days 1-2 there was a small but significant increase of NCAM PSA-positive hippocampal granule cells followed by an equally significant decrease at post-occlusion day 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, a substantial increase in glial PSA expression was observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> hippocampal regions at 1-7 days post-occlusion that was associated generally with stellate astroglia and specifically with the radial processes of glia traversing the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The temporal and regional pattern of polysialylated NCAM expression in the ischemic gerbil hippocampus implicates this neuroplastic marker in mechanisms of neurotrophic-dependent repair/remodeling that ensue following transient interruption of blood flow </plain></SENT>
