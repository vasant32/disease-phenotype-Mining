<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> incidence and mortality rate in these patients vary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients that underwent carotid endarterectomy (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CES</z:e>) are at a higher risk of progression of contralateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to investigate the management and natural history of the contralateral internal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid artery disease</z:e> in patients with internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (ICAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During one year, 297 patients with ICAO were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Follow up examinations were retrospectively analyzed and patients were divided into groups according to contralateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0741975" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Out of 297 patients, only one investigation was performed in 90 patients with carotid occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirty three patients were followed up due to postoperative ICAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 14 patients, ICAO developed during ultrasonographic follow up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In this group of patients, 9 had unchanged contralateral findings, whereas in 5 patients disease progression was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Out of 44 patients with ICAO and contralateral subtotal stenosis at initial investigation, 42 underwent carotid surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Postoperatively, 32 patients had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> findings, 6 developed mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo>, 2 developed moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0100546'>carotid stenosis</z:hpo>, and 2 had postoperative carotid occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Two patients were followed-up without intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Nine patients with bilateral ICAO were followed-up for years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Follow up was continued in 106 patients with ICAO and contralateral mild to moderate changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The finding was unchanged in 68 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In 21 (30%) patients the disease progressed to subtotal stenosis and 18 patients underwent carotid surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, contralateral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0741975" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">carotid disease</z:e> progression was observed in one third of patients with carotid occlusion </plain></SENT>
