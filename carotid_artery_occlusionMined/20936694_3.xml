<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Neuronal cells derived from mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) were reported to have more therapeutic effect than MSCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For elucidating the therapeutic mechanism of neuronal cells, here we generated a model of focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007785" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral infarction</z:e> by performing left common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> in adult gerbils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We transfected human trabecular bone-derived MSCs (hMSCs) with the Notch intracellular domain to induce their differentiation into neuronal cells (hN-MSCs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These cells were stereotaxically transplanted into the local ischemic hemisphere 4 days after the occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Behavioral analyses were conducted 28 days after transplantation, and then fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and a histological evaluation were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Histologically, transplanted cells were distributed around the periinfarct region, and approximately 8.5% and 4.2% of hN-MSCs and hMSCs survived, respectively; 53.2% ± 9.6% of hN-MSCs were microtubule-associated protein 2(+) (MAP-2(+) ) and extended neurites, whereas only 0.9% ± 0.3% of hMSCs were MAP-2(+)  </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In FISH, human nucleus-specific signals were detected in both hN-MSCs and hMSCs grafted brains, but no transplanted cell had a merged gerbil-specific nuclear signals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>hN-MSC-transplanted animals showed significantly better recovery than animals given control vehicle in the T-maze, bilateral asymmetry, and open field tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings suggested that hN-MSCs have greater therapeutic potential than hMSCs for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> and that cell fusion does not primarily contribute to the therapeutic mechanism of MSC transplantation </plain></SENT>
