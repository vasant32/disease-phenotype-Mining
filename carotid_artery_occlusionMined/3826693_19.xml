<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>II-III patients anesthetized with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi>-50% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17045,29796">N2O</z:chebi> in O2 for carotid endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Each patient was monitored with 16-channel EEG throughout anesthesia and surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Critical rCBF was defined as that flow below which EEG signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Critical rCBF (T1/2 method of analysis) was less than 10 ml X 100 g-1 X min-1 (mean +/- SE 5.9 +/- 1.2) in the six patients in whom transient EEG changes occurred at the time of temporary surgical carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No EEG changes occurred with occlusion in the other 25 patients; mean (+/- SE) occlusion rCBF in this group was 18.9 +/- 1.3 ml X 100 g-1 X min-1 (P less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Preocclusion flows were not significantly different in the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Critical rCBF during <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> anesthesia was less than that previously determined during <z:chebi fb="2" ids="5615">halothane</z:chebi> anesthesia (18-20 ml X 100 g-1 X min-1), and is compatible with the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6015">isoflurane</z:chebi> on CMRO2 and CBF </plain></SENT>
