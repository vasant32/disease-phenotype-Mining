<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: As opposed to symptomatic carotid occlusion, little information is available on the prognosis of asymptomatic carotid occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Thirty never-symptomatic and 81 symptomatic patients with carotid occlusion underwent baseline assessment of 15 risk factors together with PET measurements of oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Every 6-month telephone contact recorded interval medical treatment and subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> occurrence during an average follow-up of 32 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients, treating physicians, and an end point adjudicator were blinded to PET results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>Ischemic stroke</z:hpo> occurred in 1 of 30 of never-symptomatic patients (3.3%) and 15 of 81 of symptomatic patients (18.5%; p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>strokes</z:hpo> in the carotid territory distal to the occluded vessel occurred in the never-symptomatic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis of baseline risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 111 patients revealed that age, plasma fibrinogen level, and PET findings of high OEF distal to the occluded carotid artery were the only independent predictors of subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Previous ipsilateral hemispheric or <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> symptoms was not a significant predictive variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The lower risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> in never-symptomatic patients was associated with a lower incidence of high OEF (4 of 30) as opposed to symptomatic patients (39 of 81; p = 0.002), but there was no significant difference in age or fibrinogen level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Never-symptomatic carotid occlusion carries a very low risk of subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This benign prognosis is associated with a low incidence of cerebral hemodynamic compromise in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These data support further the importance of hemodynamic factors in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in patients with carotid occlusion </plain></SENT>
