<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies using intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29321">sodium nitroprusside</z:chebi> for hypotensive challenge yielded false-negative results for haemodynamic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e>, highlighting the difference between pharmacological and compensatory vasodilatory responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We reviewed our management result of a combined approach of clinical assessment and angiographic assessment of venous drainage using intravenous <z:chebi fb="2" ids="6343">labetalol</z:chebi> for hypotensive challenge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective review of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> balloon test occlusions carried in a single neurosurgical institute between August 1996 and August 2009 was carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with internal carotid artery <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> and pseudoaneurysms were reviewed accordingly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The diagnosis at the time of treatment included radiotherapy-induced internal carotid artery pseudoaneurysms in nasopharyngeal <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> patients (11/23, 48%), cavernous internal carotid artery giant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> (6/23, 26%) and ophthalmic segment internal carotid artery giant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> (4/23, 17%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nineteen (79%) patients passed the balloon test occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the cohort of patients that passed balloon test occlusion and underwent main trunk occlusion, there were no (0/20, 0%) permanent and no (0, 0%) transient neurological complications related to a subsequent parent <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A combined approach of clinical assessment and angiographic assessment of venous drainage, using intravenous <z:chebi fb="2" ids="6343">labetalol</z:chebi> for hypotensive challenge, is effective in screening out patients who were at a risk for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischaemia</z:e> after internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and can serve as a guideline for the selection of patients requiring extracranial-intracranial bypass </plain></SENT>
