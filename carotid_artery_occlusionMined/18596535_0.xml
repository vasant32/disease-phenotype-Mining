<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Several different methodologies for proximal occlusion and retrograde suction decompression of large paraclinoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> have been reported previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this article, we describe the novel use of an endovascular embolectomy device (F.A.S.T. funnel catheter; Genesis Medical Interventional, Inc., Redwood City, CA) for temporary internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> and suction decompression of an <z:hpo ids='HP_0004944'>intracranial aneurysm</z:hpo> to facilitate surgical clip ligation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The combination of atraumatic occlusion technology and large lumen size makes this technique safer and easier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 53-year-old woman with progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> underwent computed tomographic angiography, which revealed an unruptured large left paraclinoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cerebral angiography confirmed the diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patient did not tolerate a balloon test occlusion for therapeutic Hunterian internal carotid occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patient was subsequently taken to the operating room for a craniotomy and clip ligation of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: A standard left pterional craniotomy was performed with opening of the sylvian fissure and exposure of the left paraclinoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Intraoperative angiography with introduction of a new endovascular embolectomy device was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The device was deployed to achieve temporary occlusion of the cervical internal carotid artery, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> through the central lumen allowed for retrograde suction decompression of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Collapse of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysm</z:hpo> through this technique permitted visualization of the aneurysmal neck with successful clip ligation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A new endovascular embolectomy device can be used to safely perform suction decompression of large paraclinoid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002617'>aneurysms</z:hpo> to facilitate clip ligation </plain></SENT>
