<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In each control subject, the regional CBV was linearly and positively correlated with both CBF and CMRO2, while the local mean transit time (t = CBV/CBF) was uniformly distributed, reflecting the local adaptation of both the vascular tone and the capillary density to the metabolic demand at constant cerebral perfusion pressure that characterizes the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In patients with subcortical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, cortical blood volume was reduced in proportion to the matched reduction in CBF and CMRO2, suggesting that the metabolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> resulting from cortical deafferentation increases the resting tone of pial vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Unilateral carotid occlusion induced larger CBV and t, and steeper slopes of the CBV-CBF relationship, particularly on the occluded but also on the patent side </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The assessment of the local cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) as judged by the ratio CBF/CBV in 3 patients with focally raised OEF and preserved or reduced CMRO2, allowed the demonstration in multiple cerebral regions of single patients of two well-known physiological phenomena: the autoregulation of CBF, followed by the rise of the OEF as local CPP <z:hpo ids='HP_0002527'>falls</z:hpo> further </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> of CMRO2 in the ischaemic cortex was associated with a trend for CBV to return towards <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values, compared with the maximally elevated CBV found in oligaemic but metabolically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This suggests that a process of metabolic vasoconstriction may participate, among other factors, in the vascular collapse that occurs, and would serve to regenerate some haemodynamic reserve, at very low CPP levels </plain></SENT>
