<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Reflex responses to bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (BCO) were greatly inhibited by 5-HTP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The hypotensive effects were markedly inhibited by cerebral and extracerebral decarboxylase inhibition with RO 4-4602 and the inhibition of BCO was delayed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Selective extracerebral decarboxylase inhibitation with MK 486 did not prevent either the hypotensive action of 5-HTP or the effect on BCO, although the amino acid now consistently caused <z:hpo ids='HP_0001662'>bradycardia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Left ventricular pressure and dP/dt were reduced, but cardiac output was maintained by an increase in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> volume </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>Hypotension</z:hpo> was due predominantly to decreased peripheral resistance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The hypotensive action of 5-HTP was abolished or greatly attenuated after pretreatment with either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="10093">yohimbine</z:chebi> or methysergide, but was unaffected by <z:chebi fb="6" ids="5613">haloperidol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that cerebral decarboxylation and formation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28790">5-HT</z:chebi> are responsible for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> after 5-HTP in MAO inhibited dogs </plain></SENT>
