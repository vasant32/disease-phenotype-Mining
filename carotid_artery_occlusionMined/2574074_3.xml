<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Changes in blood pressure were measured in cats anaesthetised with alpha-chloralose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fatiguing isometric contractions of the hind limb muscles (ergoreceptor activation) were generated using a microprocessor controlled stimulator (50 Hz, 0.2 ms, 200-800 mV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Baroreceptor inactivation was elicited by carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Muscle contraction caused an increase in mean arterial pressure of 51 (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e> 12) mm Hg and carotid occlusion an increase of 56(9) mm Hg above resting levels in control conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Injection of dynorphin (0.5-5.0 micrograms.5 microliters-1) into the cerebral aqueduct just rostral to the 4th ventricle eliminated the pressor response to muscular contraction (mean arterial pressure at rest, 80-118 mm Hg: on <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp>, 72-129 mm Hg) but did not affect the pressor response to carotid occlusion in the same cats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similarly, injections of met-enkephalin (1-100 micrograms.5 microliters-1) or beta-endorphin (10-100 micrograms.5 microliters-1) eliminated the ergoreceptor induced changes in mean arterial pressure during isometric contractions but had no effect on the changes caused by carotid occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pressor responses to nerve crush were not eliminated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results support the suggestion that a catecholaminergic-opioidergic pathway in part mediates the cardiovascular responses to ergoreceptor afferent but probably not baroreceptor afferent input </plain></SENT>
