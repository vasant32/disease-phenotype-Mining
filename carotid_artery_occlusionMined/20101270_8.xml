<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The rat model with vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> was established by permanent bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (BCCAO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The observing time-points were determined at 4, 8 and 16 weeks after BCCAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Animals were randomly divided into sham-operated group (n = 6), model group (subdivided into 3 groups: 4 weeks after BCCAO, n = 6; 8 weeks after BCCAO, n = 6; and 16 weeks after BCCAO, n = 6), and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50694">minocycline</z:chebi> group (subdivided into 3 groups: 4 weeks after BCCAO, n = 6; 8 weeks after BCCAO, n = 6; and 16 weeks after BCCAO, n = 6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="50694">Minocycline</z:chebi> was administered by douche via stomach after BCCAO until sacrifice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) was examined by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Levels of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) were measured by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>IL-1beta and TNF-alpha levels were tested with ELISA method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Levels of GFAP, COX-2, NF-kappaB, IL-1beta and TNF-alpha were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> up-regulated after permanent BCCAO, which could be significantly inhibited by <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50694">minocycline</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50694">Minocycline</z:chebi> could ameliorate the <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> in the hippocampus of the vascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> rat model </plain></SENT>
