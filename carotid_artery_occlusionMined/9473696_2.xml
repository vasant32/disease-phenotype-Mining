<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After 14 weeks, 2-VO rats (N = 4) showing severe visuo-spatial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002354'>memory impairment</z:hpo> were given <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28262">dimethyl sulfoxide</z:chebi> (DMSO)-<z:chebi fb="15" ids="28757">fructose</z:chebi> 1,6-<z:chebi fb="2" ids="18361">diphosphate</z:chebi> (FDP) i.p. for seven days and retested on the water maze </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After DMSO-FDP, a 54% improvement in their VSM was seen which nearly reached control No-VO values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Untreated 2-VO (N = 4) and No-VO (N = 8) rats showed no significant changes in their VSM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DMSO-FDP treatment was discontinued and rats were retested on the water maze but improvement was lost and VSM function regressed to pretreatment levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical examination showed minimal neuronal damage in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 2-VO rats and slight loss of microtubule associated protein-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Glial fibrillary acidic protein immunostaining increase was observed only in untreated 2-VO rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that a DMSO-FDP combination improves VSM secondary to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> brain hypoperfusion </plain></SENT>
