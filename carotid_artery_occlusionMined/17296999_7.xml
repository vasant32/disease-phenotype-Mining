<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: 3D-CT angiography (3D-CTA), a vessel-cast technique, is useful in the diagnosis of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> and cerebrovascular disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it provides no information on blood-flow dynamics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we developed a new technique, dynamic 3D-CTA (d3D-CTA), that yields 3D images of the vasculature and allows assessment of the hemodynamics and of the cerebral perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We subjected 12 patients to d3D-CTA; 7 had <z:mp ids='MP_0009277'>brain tumors</z:mp>, 4 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0100026'>arteriovenous malformations</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0006093'>AVMs</z:mp>), and 1 presented with cervical internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>d3D-CTA was performed with a multidetector-row CT scanner with 64 detectors; the parameters were 0.5-mm section thickness, 0.5 seconds per rotation, 135 kV, and 150 mA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Contrast medium (total volume, 30-35 mL) was injected at 6-7 mL/s; scanning was started after a 5-second delay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Scans were generated with volume-rendering reconstruction and displayed in cine mode </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We succeeded in obtaining d3D-CTA scans in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The scans yielded 3D information on the vascular structures and hemodynamics and on the status of the cerebral perfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: d3D-CTA facilitates the acquisition of information on the vascular and cerebral dynamic blood flow on 3D-CTA images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Despite the relatively high radiation exposure and contrast injection speed and its limited scan range, this technique is useful for the diagnosis of patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0009277'>brain tumors</z:mp> or cerebrovascular disease and for treatment planning </plain></SENT>
