<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: A 57-year-old man presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> painful <z:hpo ids='HP_0000572'>visual loss</z:hpo> in the right eye in a setting of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, smoking and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neurological examination, a brain CT and MRI scan were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Extensive laboratory work-up excluded small artery disease, inflammatory <z:hpo ids='HP_0012089'>arteritis</z:hpo> or cardiac causes of <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> embolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ophthalmologic evaluation and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi> angiography gave findings consistent with OIS, while vascular ultrasound evaluation and aortic arch angiography verified right CCA occlusion accompanied by an extensive collateral network </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Had this patient been referred sooner for a simple carotid artery work-up, both the CCA occlusion and the OIS could probably had been prevented </plain></SENT>
