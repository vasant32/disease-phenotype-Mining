<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To investigate whether the risk of recurrent ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in patients with symptomatic carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (CAO) is related to (1) volume flow in the contralateral internal carotid artery (ICA), basilar artery (BA), and middle cerebral arteries (<z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCAs</z:chebi>), and (2) intracranial collateral flow to the symptomatic side, measured in the first 6 months after the qualifying symptoms occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We prospectively studied 112 patients with symptomatic CAO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Quantitative volume flow was measured with magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and collateral flow via the circle of Willis with MRA, via the ophthalmic artery (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e>) with transcranial Doppler sonography, and via leptomeningeal anastomoses with conventional angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During 49+/-14 months of follow-up (mean+/-SD), 7 patients had recurrent ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared with patients without recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo>, these patients had significantly higher total flow to the brain, ie, ICA+BA flow (mean 536 mL/min versus 410 mL/min; P&lt;0.05), and significantly higher contralateral ICA flow (355 mL/min versus 209 mL/min; P&lt;0.001), whereas BA and <z:chebi fb="70" ids="34342">MCA</z:chebi> flow showed no significant differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Also, they more often had Willisian collateral flow (P&lt;0.05), mainly caused by increased collateral flow via the posterior communicating artery (PCoA; 71% versus 28%; P&lt;0.05), whereas collateral flow via the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">OA</z:e> and leptomeningeal anastomoses did not differ significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Recurrent ipsilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002140'>ischemic stroke</z:hpo> in patients with symptomatic CAO is associated with high volume flow to the brain and increased collateral PCoA flow </plain></SENT>
