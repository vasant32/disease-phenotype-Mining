<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Six patients enrolled in the COSS underwent a standard-of-care PCT in addition to the (15)<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi>/H(2) (15)O PET study used for selection for extracranial-intracranial bypass surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PCT and PET studies were coregistered and then processed separately by different radiologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Relative measurement of cerebral blood flow (CBF) and oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) were calculated from PET </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PCT datasets were processed using different arterial input functions (AIF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Relative PCT and PET CBF values from matching regions of interest were compared using linear regression model to determine the most appropriate arterial input function for PCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Also, PCT measurements using the most accurate AIF were evaluated for linear regression with respect to relative PET OEF values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The most accurate PCT relative CBF maps with respect to the gold standard PET CBF were obtained when CBF values for each arterial territory are calculated using a dedicated AIF for each territory (R (2) = 0.796, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>PCT mean transit time (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi>) is the parameter that showed the best correlation with the count-based PET OEF ratios (R (2) = 0.590, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: PCT relative CBF compares favorably to PET relative CBF in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> carotid occlusion when processed using a dedicated AIF for each territory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The PCT <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> parameter correlated best with PET relative OEF </plain></SENT>
