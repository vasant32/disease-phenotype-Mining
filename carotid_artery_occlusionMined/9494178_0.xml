<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intraoperative quality control seem at present, of outmost importance to further reduce the impact of technical defects on perioperative neurological complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Angiography, Duplex Scanning and more recently angioscopy have been utilized as intraoperative assessments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of them demonstrated imperfections of arterial reconstruction potentially at risk for early and late patency failure and indicated immediate intraoperative correction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In some report this behaviour determined a relevant reduction both on perioperative results and lesser incidence of early restenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Concerning postoperative control of carotid endarterectomy early restenosis represent the most important and more common failure after carotid endarterectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In spite of the efforts to clear the causes of this phenomenon, none of the numerous papers published in literature has defined a specific cause determining restenosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, at present, this hyperplastic response of the arterial wall to trauma after operation is generally considered benign because rarely is responsible for new neurological symptoms or early internal carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This unanimous conviction has been achieved after years of instrumental and clinical postoperative follow-up performed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> over the world </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At the same time and probably for the above mentioned reasons, recently, has begun a new discussion about the usefulness and cost-effectiveness of prolonged Duplex scanning postoperative surveillance of the endarterectomized carotid arteries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After a meticolous review of our experience as the review of many reports of literature we, in agreement with others, are convinced that the patients operated of carotid endarterectomy, need, in most cases, a short even aggressive period of careful follow up (generally the first six months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>If during this period no irregularities or new stenosis is detected at the site of the endarterectomy, we believe that it is justified the patients to be withdrawn from a prolonged instrumental follow-up, permitting laboratory working time to be redirected towards the diagnosis of new <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
