<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: One of the pathological hallmarks of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006970'>periventricular leukomalacia</z:hpo> (PVL) is the selective vulnerability of late oligodendrocyte progenitors (preoligodendrocytes; preOLs) to <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> (H-I) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is unknown whether recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO) protects preOLs in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To develop a rat PVL model in which preOLs are selectively damaged and exhibit similar pathological changes to diffuse-type human PVL, various conditions of H-I were compared in P2-P7 rats (P2 = postnatal day 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the effect of rhEPO on oligoprotection (preOLs), rhEPO was administered to P3 PVL rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: After counts of NG2-positive and O4-positive cells were performed in P2-P7 rats, right common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> followed by 6% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi> for 0-120 min was performed in P2-P4 rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mortality and histological alterations after <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51686">hematoxylin</z:chebi>/eosin staining and ED1 immunostaining were assessed 2 days after H-I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Various doses of rhEPO (1-30,000 U/kg i.p.) were administered to PVL rats 15 min before administration of 6% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Double-positive cells for NG2 and O4 were detected from P2, and their number gradually increased until P7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although right common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> with 6% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15379">O(2)</z:chebi> for 60 min resulted in a relatively high proportion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in P2-P4 rats, typical histological changes in the PVL diffuse component were found in most surviving P3 animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>With 50-100 U/kg rhEPO, the histological damage was attenuated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Histological changes similar to those seen in the PVL diffuse component were induced by H-I in P3 rats, in which preOLs were gradually developing, and a low dose of rhEPO was effective in the treatment of brain damage induced by H-I </plain></SENT>
