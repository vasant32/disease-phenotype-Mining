<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to develop a piglet model of neonatal hypoxic-ischemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo>, which would allow for serial assessments of long-term neurodevelopmental impairment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In 12 newborn piglets, we produced <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> by 8% oxygen breathing for 5-91 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We combined <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> by reversible bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> for varying times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Outcome measures were clinical neurological evaluation, magnetic resonance spectroscopy studies and brain histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Those animals which received intravenous sedation and no mechanical ventilation showed poor tolerance to <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> and died early in the course of the experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The use of inhalation anesthesia during surgical procedures and mechanical ventilation during <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was associated with long-term survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seven of eight animals that survived &gt; or = 48 hr showed clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0000707'>neurological abnormalities</z:hpo>, that later resolved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance spectroscopy measurements did not change significantly following <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>None of the animals had histopathological <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221505" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain lesions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: When subjected to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, piglets were likely to survive only if they were given such supportive measures as anesthesia and mechanical ventilation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Even with hypoxic-ischemic injury sufficient to produce <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> signs of neurological dysfunctions, longterm, stable survival with no evident brain histopathological abnormalities was possible </plain></SENT>
