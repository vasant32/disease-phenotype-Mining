<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The protective activity of Shengmai San, a traditional Chinese herbal medicine, was studied in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-reperfusion injury in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Shengmai San consists of three herbal components, Panax Ginseng, Ophiopogon Japonicus and Schisandra Chinensis and is routinely being used for treating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010068" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">coronary heart disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When Shengmai San was injected directly into rat duodenum 2h before <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> by bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33202">thiobarbituric acid</z:chebi> reactive substance (TBARS) formation during reperfusion following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> was almost completely suppressed in the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The loss of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> peroxidase activity after the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion was also effectively prevented by the Shengmai San pre-administration whereas the activity was considerably decreased in the damaged brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It was found that Shengmai San also effectively suppressed the TBARS formation even when it was administered after 45 min reperfusion following <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>, indicating that Shengmai San improves the oxidative damage already established in the brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Likewise, the decrease of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> peroxidase activity was minimized in the damaged brain by the post-administration of Shengmai San </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, none of the Shengmai San components were active in protecting the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e>-reperfusion brain damage when they were independently administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These experiments suggest the potential of Shengmai San in both preventive and therapeutic usages for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>cerebral ischemia</z:hpo>-reperfusion injury </plain></SENT>
