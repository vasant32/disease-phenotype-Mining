<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent studies suggest that AD is primarily a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disorder</z:e> and copper (Cu) may play an important role in AD pathology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the consequences of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> Cu exposure at the presence of other AD risk factors remain to be clarified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To investigate the effects of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> Cu intake on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1695782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cerebral hypoperfusion</z:e>-induced AD pathology, Sprague-Dawley rats suffered bilateral common carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (2VO) were administrated with 250 ppm copper-containing water or not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001465'>Morris water maze</z:mp> test showed that Cu exposure for 3 months exacerbated <z:hpo ids='HP_0100543'>cognitive impairment</z:hpo> induced by 2VO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Elevated amyloid precursor protein (APP) and beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) expression in <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein levels were also observed in brain of Cu-exposed rats suffered 2VO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, these Cu-exacerbated changes were ameliorated after Cu was withdrawn from drinking water </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In summary, our findings demonstrate that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> Cu exposure might exacerbate AD pathology in 2VO rats </plain></SENT>
