<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We designed the present study to examine the effects of red blood cell oxygen-delivering capacity on ischemic brain metabolism during hemodilution with respect to red blood cell <z:chebi fb="0" ids="19324">2,3-bisphosphoglycerate</z:chebi> content </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A modification of red blood cell <z:chebi fb="0" ids="19324">2,3-bisphosphoglycerate</z:chebi> content was achieved by an exchange transfusion of blood in which red blood cells were treated with either phospho(<z:chebi fb="0" ids="33823">enol</z:chebi>)<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi> or inorganic phosphate in spontaneously hypertensive rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hematocrit values of circulating blood were varied from 30% to 20% during transfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Brain ischemia</z:e> was produced in rats by bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> lasting 60 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The concentrations of ATP and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="19324">2,3-bisphosphoglycerate</z:chebi> in the blood and the ATP, phosphocreatine, and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> concentrations in the brain were estimated by an enzymatic method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Red blood cell <z:chebi fb="0" ids="19324">2,3-bisphosphoglycerate</z:chebi> concentration increased to 200% of the pretransfusion level after the transfusion in which red blood cells were treated with phospho(<z:chebi fb="0" ids="33823">enol</z:chebi>)<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi>, whereas the concentration decreased to 80% after the transfusion in which red blood cells were treated with phosphate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Red blood cell ATP content did not differ significantly between the phospho(<z:chebi fb="0" ids="33823">enol</z:chebi>)<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15361">pyruvate</z:chebi>- and phosphate-treated groups after transfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When hematocrit was approximately 30%, the ischemic brain ATP and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> contents did not differ between the nonischemic and ischemic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, as hematocrit was reduced to less than 25% the ischemic brain ATP content remarkably decreased and the <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> content substantially increased in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="19324">2,3-bisphosphoglycerate</z:chebi>-subnormal red blood cell group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the ischemic brain ATP and phosphocreatine contents in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="19324">2,3-bisphosphoglycerate</z:chebi>-enriched red blood cell group were preserved and as high as those in the nonischemic group under the same conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002637'>Cerebral ischemia</z:hpo> was compensated with the increment of cerebral blood flow as a result of the reduction of hematocrit to optimal levels, but the extreme hemodilution induced insufficient oxygen supply to the brain tissue, resulting in a more marked impairment of brain metabolism despite an increase in cerebral blood flow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, even in extreme hemodilution conditions the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="19324">2,3-bisphosphoglycerate</z:chebi>-enriched red blood cells in circulating blood protected the brain from ischemic metabolic changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="19324">2,3-bisphosphoglycerate</z:chebi>-enriched red blood cells in the circulating blood may thus compensate for the insufficient oxygen supply in extremely anemic conditions by providing a sufficient supply of oxygen in the face of ischemic insult </plain></SENT>
