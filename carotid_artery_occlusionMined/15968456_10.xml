<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Maps of T2 and the apparent diffusion coefficient (<z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi>) of water were acquired in 1-week-old rats at times prior to cerebral HI (right carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> plus 1.5 h of <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>), within the last 5-10 min of HI, and 1 h or 24 h after HI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Near the end of HI, <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> decreased and T2 increased in both cortical gray and subcortical white matter within the cingulum of the HI hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One hour after HI, <z:chebi fb="49" ids="35181">ADC</z:chebi> partially recovered, but T2 remained increased and then increased further by 24 h post-HI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast to the similar <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> responses in white and gray matter, histological evidence for irreversible cell damage occurred in white matter earlier than in gray matter within the HI hemisphere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 1 h post-HI, rarefied or disrupted nerve fibers and an increase in TUNEL-positive cells were observed within white matter in the cingulum, whereas neurons within the cortical gray matter appeared <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By 24 h post-HI, damage was apparent in both white and gray matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging detected <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> tissue <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> following cerebral HI in both gray and white matter but did not distinguish between the early irreversible tissue injury detected histologically in white but not gray matter in this rather severe model of neonatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
