<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our previous study revealed that taltirelin, a novel orally active TRH analogue, binds to rat brain TRH receptors in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study was undertaken to investigate whether taltirelin has neuroprotective effects in transient <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007786" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">brain ischemia</z:e> of C57BL/6J mice induced by bilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> (2VO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neuronal cell density in the hippocampal CA1 region of C57BL/6J mice was significantly (39.9%) decreased 1 week after 2VO-reperfusion, compared to the case of the sham group, and this reduction of hippocampal neuronal density was significantly suppressed by an intravenous (i.v.) injection of taltirelin (0.3 mg/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The i.v. injection of taltirelin at this dosage produced a significant increase in the dissociation constant (Kd) of specific [3H]MeTRH binding in sham and 2VO-reperfusion groups (33.6 and 51.4%, respectively) compared with the vehicle-treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that the intravenously injected taltirelin bound to TRH receptors in the ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was little difference in the brain-to-plasma concentration ratio (Kp) of [<z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>]<z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi> between the sham and 2VO groups of C57BL/6J mice, indicating that the tight junction of the blood-brain barrier may be intact in the ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the study has shown that taltirelin may have a significant neuroprotective effect on the ischemic brain </plain></SENT>
