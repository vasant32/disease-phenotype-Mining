<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To retrospectively analyze the clinical results for emergent endovascular carotid recanalization in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> proximal (cervical) ICA occlusion and to assess predictors of recanalization and clinical, neurological, and functional outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Emergent endovascular revascularization was attempted in 22 patients presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> secondary to complete cervical ICA occlusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with pseudo-occlusion were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recanalization was assessed with the Thrombolysis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="IHD">Myocardial Ischemia</z:e> (TIMI) system: grade 0 (no flow) to grade 3 (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> flow) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 65 years; mean admission National Institutes of Health <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>Stroke</z:hpo> Scale (NIHSS) score was 14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Recanalization (TIMI grade 2/3) occurred in 17 patients (77.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ten patients (45.5%) demonstrated significant clinical improvement during hospitalization (NIHSS improved ≥4 points) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fifty percent of patients had good outcomes (modified Rankin Scale ≤2) after a median follow-up of 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patient age &lt;70 years and successful recanalization (TIMI grade 2/3) predicted a good outcome (P ≤ .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo>, admission NIHSS score ≥20, and complete ICA occlusion at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> levels (cervical, petrocavernous, and intracranial) were associated with poor outcomes (P ≤ .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients with complete cervical ICA occlusion but partial distal preservation of the vessel were most likely to benefit from the intervention (recanalization in 88.2%; good outcome in 64.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Attempts at emergent endovascular carotid recanalization for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> are encouraged, particularly in younger patients with partial distal preservation of the ICA </plain></SENT>
