<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Blood flow was measured with [131I]iodoantipyrine and protein synthesis with [<z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>]leucine using double-tracer autoradiography and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30956">trichloroacetic acid</z:chebi> wash-incubation for removal of nonincorporated tracer radioactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Specific activity of blood and brain leucine and [<z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>]leucine incorporation into brain proteins was also measured by conventional high-performance liquid chromatography to validate the autoradiographic approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In control gerbils, gray matter blood flow ranged between 180 and 220 ml/100 g/min and fractional amino acid incorporation was approximately 80% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Unilateral carotid <z:mp ids='MP_0006134'>artery occlusion</z:mp> resulted in graded <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> with blood flow between 10 and 100 ml/100 g/min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Regional cerebral protein synthesis gradually declined at blood flows of less than 100 ml/100 g/min and approached 0 at a blood flow of 40 ml/100 g/min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This threshold for complete suppression of protein synthesis is much higher than that for maintenance of tissue energy state and suggests that the size of an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_124'>infarct</z:mpath> after focal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ischemia</z:e> is determined by the suppression of protein synthesis rather than by the breakdown of energy metabolism </plain></SENT>
