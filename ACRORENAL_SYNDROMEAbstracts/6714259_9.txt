The case of a 2-year-old boy with associated anomalies of the limbs and the urinary system is reported. Similar to cases reported earlier he presented a split hand and foot syndrome, but differed from previously reported cases by the presence of bilateral renal hypoplasia leading to end stage renal failure. Renal histology disclosed oligomeganephronia.
