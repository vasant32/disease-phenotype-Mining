<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Background  <z:hpo ids='HP_0100825'>Cheilitis</z:hpo> glandularis (CG) is a rare condition in which thick saliva is secreted from dilated ostia of swollen minor salivary glands from the lips </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Aquaporins (AQPs) are membrane proteins that exhibit channel activity specific for water and small solutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AQPs are essential for corporal homeostasis, and are widely expressed through human tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Most AQPs studies are based on renal and <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> pathophysiology; few involve salivary glands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Some previous investigators hypothesized that minor salivary gland structure and function is <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> on CG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Objectives  To study possible salivary synthesis alterations in CG, we compared the expression of AQPs present in minor salivary glands in specimens with CG and controls by using immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Methods  Seven cases of CG and three <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results  Intensity and patterns of expression of AQP 1, 2 and 8 differed in CG compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>AQP 4 and 5 (the most important AQP in salivary function) showed identical patterns in CG and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conclusion  Our findings suggest that the expression and arguably, function of some of the AQPs may be altered in CG; consequently, water flow mechanism abnormalities with possible alteration in salivary composition seem to occur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>External factors (mainly UV rays) seem to play an important role in CG; nonetheless, our findings suggest that there might be some degree of alteration on water transportation </plain></SENT>
