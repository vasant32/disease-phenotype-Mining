<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is characterized by enlargement and eversion of the lip in association with excretory duct <z:mpath ids='MPATH_66'>dilatation</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three types of CG have been described in the literature; the classification is based on the common clinical and histopathologic findings (ie, simple, superficial, and deep) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This report is of an unusual case of CG simplex for which the initial histopathologic diagnosis was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_298'>papillary cystadenoma</z:mpath>, a neoplastic process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The lesion was completely excised, and final microscopic review of a larger specimen revealed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> sclerosing <z:mp ids='MP_0001870'>sialadenitis</z:mp>, dilated salivary secretory ducts with oncocytic change and periductal <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, and foci of adenomatous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> consisting of enlarged ducts exhibiting squamous <z:mpath ids='MPATH_162'>epithelial metaplasia</z:mpath> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> with papillary architecture </plain></SENT>
