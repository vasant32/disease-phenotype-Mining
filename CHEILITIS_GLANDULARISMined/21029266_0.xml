<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To present a combination of clinical and histopathological criteria for diagnosing <z:hpo ids='HP_0100825'>cheilitis</z:hpo> glandularis (CG), and to evaluate the association between CG and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0004207'>SCC</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The medical literature in English was searched from 1950 to 2010 and selected demographic data, and clinical and histopathological features of CG were retrieved and analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 77 cases have been published and four new cases were added to the collective data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The clinical criteria applied included the coexistence of multiple lesions and mucoid/purulent discharge, while the histopathological criteria included two or more of the following findings: sialectasia, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, mucous/<z:mpath ids='MPATH_170'>oncocytic metaplasia</z:mpath> and mucin in ducts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only 47 (58.0%) cases involving patients with a mean age of 48.5 Â± 20.3 years and a male-to-female ratio of 2.9:1 fulfilled the criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The lower lip alone was most commonly affected (70.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CG was associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0004207'>SCC</z:mp> in only three cases (3.5%) for which there was a clear aetiological factor for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The proposed diagnostic criteria can assist in delineating true CG from a variety of lesions with a comparable clinical/histopathological presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CG in association with premalignant/malignant epithelial changes of the lower lip may represent secondary, reactive changes of the salivary glands </plain></SENT>
