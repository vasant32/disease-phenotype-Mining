<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0100825'>Cheilitis</z:hpo> glandularis (CG) is a condition in which thick saliva is secreted by minor labial salivary glands and adheres to a swollen lip causing discomfort to the patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most publications refer to single case reports or small case series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We sought to report and to analyze clinical, pathological, and therapeutic data on 22 patients with CG seen at the department of dermatology at our university </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Retrospective data about 22 patients with CG are reviewed and presented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventeen patients were male and 5 were female </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> were fair skinned, including 6 <z:mp ids='MP_0001189'>albino</z:mp> individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Several of them presented significant signs of photodamage on the lips </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Surgical treatment was performed in 10 severely affected patients and consisted of a vermilionectomy followed by minor salivary gland removal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Histopathological study revealed various degrees of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001870'>sialadenitis</z:mp> and vermilion epithelial changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Superficially invasive and in situ <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> of the vermilion was detected in 3 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>LIMITATIONS: Biopsy and surgery were not performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: CG is strongly related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000992'>sun sensitivity</z:hpo> and may be more severe in <z:mp ids='MP_0001189'>albino</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The swollen, sun-exposed lip may become more susceptible to the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
