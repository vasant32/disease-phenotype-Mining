<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Pinpoint openings evident throughout the lip surface exuded a clear, sticky, mucoid secretion </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The presumptive offending drug was discontinued, and conservative therapy (topical clobetasol ointment, oral <z:chebi fb="10" ids="8776">ranitidine</z:chebi>, and oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5050">fexofenadine</z:chebi>) was initiated </plain></SENT>
