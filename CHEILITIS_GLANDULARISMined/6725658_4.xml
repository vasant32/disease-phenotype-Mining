<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied labial biopsy specimens of five patients with clinical CG and compared their salivary tissue with that seen in patients without CG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The labial glands from patients with CG did not differ in size, depth, or histologic appearance from those seen in the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They showed little or no <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and no <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also reviewed forty-eight cases of CG described in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The accompanying photomicrographs nearly always depicted <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-appearing labial salivary glands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The case histories and clinical descriptions suggested that many examples of CG were manifestations of actinic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100825'>cheilitis</z:hpo>, whereas others may have been unusual presentations of atopic or factitious <z:hpo ids='HP_0100825'>cheilitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We believe CG represents an unusual reaction pattern in response to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> irritation of the lips and is unrelated to labial salivary gland <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
