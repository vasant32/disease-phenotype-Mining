<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We quantitatively evaluated the differences in signal intensity between LH and HH in order to examine this classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty-two hematopoietic areas in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> were classified into two groups of 23 LH and 19 HH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The signal ratios of hematopoietic areas to muscle on T1WI and STIR were calculated, and the differences between LH and HH were statistically evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The signal ratios of LH were significantly higher on T1WI and lower on STIR than those of HH (unpaired t-test, p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This result indicated that LH consisted of more <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151773" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypocellular marrow</z:e> than HH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Op-T1WI were useful in differentiating between LH and HH and defining the degree of hematopoiesis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
