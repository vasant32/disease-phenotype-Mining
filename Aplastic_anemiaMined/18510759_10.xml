<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17478">Aldehyde</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (ALDH) is a cytosolic enzyme highly expressed in hematopoietic precursors from cord blood and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor mobilized peripheral blood, as well as in bone marrow from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloblastic leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As regards human <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow, detailed characterization of ALDH+ cells has been addressed by one single study (Gentry et al, 2007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The goal of our work was to provide new information about the dissection of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow progenitor cells based upon the simultaneous detection by flow cytometry of ALDH and early hematopoietic antigens, with particular attention to the expression of ALDH on erythroid precursors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To this aim, we used three kinds of approach: i) multidimensional analytical flow cytometry, detecting ALDH and early hematopoietic antigens in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow; ii) fluorescence activated cell sorting of distinct subpopulations of progenitor cells, followed by in vitro induction of erythroid differentiation; iii) detection of ALDH+ cellular subsets in bone marrow from pure red cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow, we identified three populations of cells, namely ALDH+CD34+, ALDH-CD34+ and ALDH+CD34- (median percentages were 0.52, 0.53 and 0.57, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As compared to ALDH-CD34+ cells, ALDH+CD34+ cells expressed the phenotypic profile of primitive hematopoietic progenitor cells, with brighter expression of CD117 and CD133, accompanied by lower display of CD38 and CD45RA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of interest, ALDH+CD34- population disclosed a straightforward erythroid commitment, on the basis of three orders of evidences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>First of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, ALDH+CD34- cells showed a CD71bright, CD105+, CD45- phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Secondly, induction of differentiation experiments evidenced a clear-cut expression of glycophorin A (CD235a) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Finally, ALDH+CD34- precursors were not detectable in patients with pure red cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> (PRCA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our study, comparing surface antigen expression of ALDH+/CD34+, ALDH-/CD34+ and ALDH+/CD34- progenitor cell subsets in human bone marrow, clearly indicated that ALDH+CD34- cells are mainly committed towards erythropoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>To the best of our knowledge this finding is new and could be useful for basic studies about <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> erythropoietic differentiation as well as for enabling the employment of ALDH as a red cell marker in polychromatic flow cytometry characterization of bone marrow from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
