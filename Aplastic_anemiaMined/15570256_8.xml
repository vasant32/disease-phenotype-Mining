<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One patient had an HLA-B subtype-mismatched donor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Conditioning for SAA mainly consisted of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> and total body irradiation, and that for IEM consisted of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received antithymocyte globulin during conditioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After HSCT, they were given <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> combined with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> for immunosuppression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two patients rejected their grafts: 1 died of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo>, and the other was successfully regrafted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cumulative incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> grades II to IV was 24%, whereas <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> occurred in 21% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 5-year survival rates were 83% in the SAA group and 85% in those with IEM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that HSCT with HLA-A, -B, and -DRbeta1 genomically matched unrelated donors in combination with antithymocyte globulin in the conditioning regimen gives encouraging results in patients with SAA or IEM </plain></SENT>
