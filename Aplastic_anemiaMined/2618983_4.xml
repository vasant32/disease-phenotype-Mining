<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) may rarely present with blood and bone marrow findings suggestive of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although numerous examples of ALL presenting with this phenomenon have been reported, there is no accepted explanation for the pathogenesis of this preleukemic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report a case of a child with ALL whose initial presentation was characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow hypoplasia</z:hpo> and who had repeated episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> at times of systemic relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In vitro coculture experiments demonstrated that the leukemic cells from this patient were inhibitory for the growth of myeloid, erythroid, and megakaryocytic progenitor cells from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> peripheral blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This inhibitory effect exhibited a dose-dependent relationship with the number of added lymphoblasts and persisted when the lymphoblasts were irradiated to prevent leukemic cell growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Inhibitory activity was not present in media conditioned by the growth of the patient's lymphoblasts, nor was it present in lymphoblasts from three other children with ALL with similar immunophenotype but without marrow <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that the aplastic presentation of ALL may be attributable to inhibitory properties intrinsic to the leukemic cells rather than to other host factors </plain></SENT>
