<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Since the publication of a major international case-control study on the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0000334'>agranulocytosis</z:mp> associated with the use of medicines in the 1980s, many new drugs have been introduced in therapeutics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventeen units of hematology contribute to the case-control surveillance of <z:mp ids='MP_0000334'>agranulocytosis</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> in Barcelona, Spain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After a follow-up of 78.73 million person-years, 177 community cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0000334'>agranulocytosis</z:mp> were compared with 586 sex-, age, and hospital-matched control subjects with regard to previous use of medicines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The annual incidence of community-acquired <z:mp ids='MP_0000334'>agranulocytosis</z:mp> was 3.46:1 million, and it increased with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The fatality rate was 7.0%, and the mortality rate was 0.24:1 million </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The drug most strongly associated with a risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0000334'>agranulocytosis</z:mp> was <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9589">ticlopidine hydrochloride</z:chebi> with an odds ratio (OR) of 103.23 (95% confidence interval [CI], 12.73-837.44), followed by calcium dobesilate (OR, 77.84 [95% CI, 4.50-1346.20]), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50671">antithyroid drugs</z:chebi> (OR, 52.75 [95% CI, 5.82-478.03]), dipyrone (metamizole <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> and metamizole <z:chebi fb="131" ids="25107">magnesium</z:chebi>) (OR, 25.76 [95% CI, 8.39-179.12]), and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9241">spironolactone</z:chebi> (OR, 19.97 [95% CI, 2.27-175.89]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Other drugs associated with a significant risk were pyrithyldione, cinepazide, aprindine <z:chebi fb="16" ids="36807">hydrochloride</z:chebi>, carbamazepine, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35358">sulfonamides</z:chebi>, phenytoin and phenytoin <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35627">beta-lactam</z:chebi> antibiotics, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="42355,48923">erythromycin</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25629">stearate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="42355,48923">erythromycin</z:chebi> ethylsuccinate, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4509">diclofenac sodium</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Individual attributable incidences for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these drugs, which collectively accounted for 68.6% of cases, were less than 1:1 million per year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:mp ids='MP_0000334'>Agranulocytosis</z:mp> is rare but serious </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A few drugs account for two thirds of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our results also provide reassurance regarding the risk associated with a number of newly marketed drugs </plain></SENT>
