<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The Eastern Mediterranean Bone Marrow Transplantation (EMBMT) Group has accumulated over 25 years of data and experience in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), most particularly in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852325" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemoglobinopathies</z:e>, severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (SAA), and inherited metabolic and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0947760" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">immune disorders</z:e>, in addition to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> peculiar to the region and where recent updates in trends in activities are warranted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To study trends in HSCT activities in the World Health Organization-Eastern Mediterranean (EM) region surveyed by EMBMT between 2008 and 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of the survey data, mainly of the cumulative number of transplants, types of transplants (autologous vs. allogeneic), types of conditioning as myeloablative (MAC) vs. reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) and trends in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852325" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemoglobinopathies</z:e>, SAA, inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> syndromes amongst others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Fourteen teams from ten Eastern Mediterranean Region Organization (EMRO) countries reported their data (100% return rate) to the EMBMT for the years 2008-2009 with a total of 2608 first HSCT (1286 in 2008; 1322 in 2009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Allogeneic HSCT represented the majority (63%) in both years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The main indications for allogeneic HSCT were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemias</z:hpo> (732; 44%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> syndromes (331, 20%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852325" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemoglobinopathies</z:e> (255; 15%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immune deficiencies</z:hpo> (90; 5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a progressive increase in the proportions of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>) cases transplanted beyond the first <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phase (3; 7% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> cases in 2008 vs 13; 29% in 2009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The main indications for autologous transplants were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1136084" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">plasma cell disorders</z:e> (345; 36%) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin disease</z:e> (256; 27%), non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (207; 22%) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> (83; 9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RIC continued to show a progressive increase over the years (7% in 2007, 11% in 2008 and 13% in 2009), yet remained relatively low compared to contemporary practices in Europe published by EBMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The vast majority (95%) of allo-HSCT sources were from sibling donors with a continued dominance of peripheral blood (PB) (1076; 63%), while cord blood transplant (CBT) increased to 83 (5% of allo-HSCT), matched unrelated donor (MUD) remained underutilized (1; 0%) and there were no haploidentical transplants reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Large centers with &gt;50 HSCT/year showed a plateau of the total number of allo-HSCT over the last 5 years that may be related to capacity issues and needs further study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS: There is an overall increased rate of HSCT in the EMRO region with a significant increase in utilization of CBT and allogeneic PB-HSCT as a valuable source </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, further research on outcome data and development of regional donor banks (CB and MUD) may help facilitate future planning to satisfy the regional needs and increase collaboration within the group and globally </plain></SENT>
