<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>He was conditioned with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (CY) and single fraction total lymphoid irradiation (TLI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>GVHD prophylaxis consisted of FK506 and a short course of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient failed to achieve durable trilineage hematopoietic engraftment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no significant myeloid response to GM-CSF or G-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Evaluation of FACS-sorted peripheral T cells from the patient by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) revealed mixed chimerism (44% host origin) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fifty-three days after the first BMT, he was treated with G-CSF primed, unmanipulated PBSC transfusions (5.28 x 10(8)/kg mononuclear, 4.28 x 10(6)/kg CD34+, 292.51 x 10(6)/kg CD3+ cells) from his original donor without reconditioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>FK506 was continued at the same dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neutrophil recovery to 0.5 x 10(9)/l and platelet engraftment to 20 x 10(9)/l was achieved 11 and 27 days following the first dose of allogeneic PBSC transfusion, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On day 23 a repeat FISH on the patient's sorted peripheral T lymphocytes revealed 91% donor origin T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The patient is currently well with a stable engraftment 6 months following allogeneic PBSC transfusion, with no signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD </plain></SENT>
