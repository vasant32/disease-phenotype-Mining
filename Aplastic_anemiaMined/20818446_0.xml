<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, to estimate the prevalence and associated risk factors for ON before allo-BMT, we conducted a retrospective analysis of magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) studies of 118 children who underwent first allo-BMT at our institution between December 2000 and September 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of the 118 consecutive patients, 107 (90.7%) underwent prospective <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> studies irrespective of symptoms (69 males; median age at allo-BMT 12.9 years), and 11 underwent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> studies for symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among the 107 who had prospective imaging, 23 (21.5%) had ON; nearly 50% had at least 30% epiphyseal involvement </plain></SENT>
