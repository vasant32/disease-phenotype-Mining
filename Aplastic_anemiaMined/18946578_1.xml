<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixteen patients were transplanted at Ain Shams University Bone Marrow Transplantation unit from March 2005 to January 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixteen patients were transplanted with a median age of 25 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Indications for transplantation were <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo>, and aggressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seven donors and 6 patients were positive for cytomegalovirus immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody (Ab) pretransplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only one patient was positive for toxoplasma IgG Ab and another had a high titre for toxoplasma IgM Ab pretransplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two donors and 2 recipients were positive for <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> B antibody markers; however, none were positive for <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> B virus DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>None of the patients or donors were positive for <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> C virus via PCR pre-transplant </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Primary cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was recurrence in 2 patients and graft failure in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thirteen are alive and disease free with a median follow-up of 20 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although our unit is a relatively new unit, these results are comparable to those achieved in the Western world and cost a mean of US$250,000 </plain></SENT>
