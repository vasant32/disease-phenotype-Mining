<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Their clinical and laboratory findings in immediate and late postoperative periods were compared with those received medical treatment alone </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Splenectomy seems to be the treatment of choice in this situation which produces long term favorable results regardless of patient's response to preoperative steroid treatment </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, splenectomy would be the first choice </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, when the patient responded to steroid treatment preoperatively, splenectomy could have reduced the frequency and amount of blood transfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Splenectomy would then be contemplated in such situations </plain></SENT>
