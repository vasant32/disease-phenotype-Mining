<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The minimum follow-up was 2 years (median, 11 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The staging distribution was IA-B, 61; IIA, 54; IIB, 20; IIIA, 46; and IIIB, 19 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sixty-one percent of the patients had laparotomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Initial management was irradiation alone (RA) in 143 patients and a combination of chemotherapy and irradiation (CB) in 57 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Actuarial 10-year survival rates were 82%, IA-B; 78%, IIA; 66%, IIB; 66%, IIIA; and 24%, IIIB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cause-specific <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> or complications of initial or salvage therapy occurred in 3% of IA-B patients, 18% of IIA-B patients, and 35% of IIIA-B patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One patient had a prior T3N1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> of the retromolar trigone, and a second was diagnosed with concurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> and granulocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Subsequent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> have occurred in six patients from 5 to 21 years after treatment, including papillary <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> of the thyroid, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005584'>renal cell carcinoma</z:hpo>, unilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast carcinoma</z:hpo>, cervix <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in situ, and <z:mp ids='MP_0008714'>lung carcinoma</z:mp> after RA, and bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast carcinoma</z:hpo> after CB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Seven fatal hematopoietic disorders (HPDs) were observed, including four <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemias</z:hpo>, one dysmyeloproliferative syndrome (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="888">DMPS</z:chebi>), one <z:hpo ids='HP_0001890'>autoimmune hemolytic anemia</z:hpo>, and one <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two occurred in patients initially managed with RA who subsequently required chemotherapy for relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Five HPDs occurred in patients initially managed with CB who never relapsed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> HPDs were observed between 2 and 7.5 years after administration of chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis of the data using a rerandomization test on Gehan ranks of treatment and clinical variables showed significant correlations between development of a secondary HPD and (1) initial management with CB; (2) higher doses of chemotherapy; and (3) more advanced disease, particularly IIIB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>When only the five events generally associated with treatment (i.e. the four <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> and one <z:chebi fb="0" ids="888">DMPS</z:chebi>) were considered, there was a significant correlation with exposure to chemotherapy and presentation with advanced disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The patient population was small so that interdependence between treatment factors and initial extent of disease in affecting the risk of a secondary HPD cannot be discounted but should be further investigated with larger patient populations </plain></SENT>
