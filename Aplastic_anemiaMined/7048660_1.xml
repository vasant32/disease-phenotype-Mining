<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One-third of the sera were cytotoxic for B and M either from different or from the same individuals, while 45% reacted only to M and appeared to recognize non-HLA M-associated antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No significant reaction to endothelial cells was obtained from these sera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The subsequent clinical course was not associated with any reaction pattern of pre-transplant sera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a significant relationship between rejection and the development of M antibodies after grafting, but since these were also found in many other patients without rejection, their occurrence has no predictive value for an individual patient </plain></SENT>
