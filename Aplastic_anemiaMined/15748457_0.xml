<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Blood platelet counts were taken on day 8, 15, 30 and 60 after the treatment, and bone marrow examination was performed on day 15 as compared with those before treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results showed that platelet counts in 3 out of 6 patients increased remarkably (50%), one of the six increased moderately (16.7%), another case of the six increased slightly (16.7%), platelet in one out of six did not significantly increase (16.7%), the total efficacy rate is 83.3%, the amount of megakaryocyte in bone marrow of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> six patients increased, the side effect of the rhIL-11 treatment was light </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the efficacy of recombinant human Interleukin-11 in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> patients with pre-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> is satisfactory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As the number of the cases is too small to conclude, further exploration needs accumulation of more applications </plain></SENT>
