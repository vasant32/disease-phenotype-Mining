<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was conducted to differentiate between FA and "idiopathic" <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> on the basis of induced chromosomal breakage study with <z:chebi fb="172" ids="27504">MMC</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: <z:chebi fb="172" ids="27504">MMC</z:chebi> stress tests in different final concentrations of 20 and 50 ng/ml of <z:chebi fb="172" ids="27504">MMC</z:chebi> were conducted on peripheral blood lymphocytes from 32 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and 13 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifty nanograms per milliliter of <z:chebi fb="172" ids="27504">MMC</z:chebi> from old, fresh and frozen stocks was used to check the sensitivity of diagnosis on FA-diagnosed patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis was used for the assessment of aberrations, including chromatid and chromosome breaks and exchanges </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eight patients (25%) with a very high percentage of chromosomal breakage were diagnosed as FA on the basis of the chromosomal breakage study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Six of these patients exhibited congenital anomalies at presentation, while another two lacked such anomalies or had minor physical problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Freshly made <z:chebi fb="172" ids="27504">MMC</z:chebi> has shown more sensitivity to detect FA patients compared with frozen or 1-week-old <z:chebi fb="172" ids="27504">MMC</z:chebi> stock </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The study indicates that freshly made <z:chebi fb="172" ids="27504">MMC</z:chebi> stress test provides an unequivocal means of differentiation between FA and "idiopathic" <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further, the study, the first of its kind from Iran, stresses on the need for conducting this test in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> cases, even those without congenital anomalies, for accurate and timely diagnosis of FA to implement appropriate therapy </plain></SENT>
