<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cell proliferation was evaluated on days 2, 3, 5, 7, and 10 of incubation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Growth patterns were different in cultures of hematologically healthy persons versus patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026986" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MDS">preleukemic syndrome</z:e> (PL) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three types of PL syndrome and two types of AA (C1 and C2) were distinguished </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow dysfunction was evaluated further using cytochemistry and electron microscopy to morphologically study cell proliferation in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cytochemical staining performed in agar demonstrated well-defined maturation defects in myelopoietic precursor cells from the bone marrow of PL patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Electron microscopic findings of Auer-body-like inclusions in "statu nascendi" in the vacuoles of preleukemic cells supported our results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>PL patient groups at high risk for development of overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and patients with grave prognosis in AA were distinguished </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results are relevant for the clinical diagnosis and prognosis of patients with cytopenia </plain></SENT>
