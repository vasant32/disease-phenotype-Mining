<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Antithymocyte globulin (ATG), a horse antihuman thymus antiserum highly effective in the majority of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, was studied for its in vitro effects on hematopoietic progenitor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Marrow cells isolated by an immunoadherence technique with the HPCA-1 (human progenitor cell antigen) monoclonal antibody after removal of contaminating T cells and macrophages formed erythroid colonies in <z:chebi fb="1" ids="53448">methyl cellulose</z:chebi> media in the presence of ATG at concentrations of 25-50 micrograms/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>ATG also stimulated continuous production of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>-containing erythroid colonies beyond 35 days of culture when it was added to the culture weekly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ATG also had an indirect effect on myeloid (granulocytic and macrophagic) colony growth in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At a concentration of 10 micrograms/ml, ATG stimulated late but not early myeloid progenitor cells to form mature colonies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This effect required the participation of lymphocytes containing the Leu-11 antigen and macrophages or supernatant fluids made from these two types of cells that had been preincubated with ATG for 3 hr and then cultured for 5 additional days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The supernatant fluids produced in such a manner showed characteristics similar to granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and had an activity peak that eluted at a volume corresponding to a 20,000 Da molecular mass protein by high-resolution liquid chromatography </plain></SENT>
