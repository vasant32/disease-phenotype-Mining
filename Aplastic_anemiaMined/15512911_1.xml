<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We studied the outcome of individuals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> conditioned with a radiation-containing regimen followed by an infusion of stem cell grafts that had been depleted of lymphocytes with CAMPATH-1H (antiCD52; humanised) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The conditioning regime consisted of fractionated (f) TBI 8 Gy followed by f total nodal irradiation (TNI) 6 Gy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, patients received CY 60 mg/kg on 2 consecutive days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cytokine-mobilized peripheral blood grafts from HLA-identical siblings were T-cell depleted with CAMPATH-1H 'in the bag' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CsA was commenced on day -1 and continued until day +90 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventeen heavily transfused patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, median age 18 years (range 14-56 years), were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median time from diagnosis to transplantation was 172 days (range 34-443 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median CD34(+) cell number infused was 3.47 x 10(6)/kg (range 1.03-18.4 x 10(6)/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients engrafted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Recovery was fast and patients reached 0.5 x 10(9)/L polymorphs by median day 11 (range 9-17 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Toxicity from the conditioning included grade 4 hematologic toxicity in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Another major toxicity was gastrointestinal mucosal damage, which exceeded grade 2 in two instances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>One patient developed thrombotic thrombocytopenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000979'>purpura</z:hpo>, which responded to substitution of CsA with tacrolimus and plasmapheresis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Another patient, who had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> blood counts, died of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> on day 241 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Chimerism studies at 6 months post-transplantation confirmed the donor origin of hematopoiesis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> seven patients tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>None of the patients developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GvHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>There was no delayed graft failure and 94% of patients had survived disease free at a median of 1303.5 days (range 216-2615 days) from graft infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: In this cohort of multiply transfused patients, the radiation-containing schedules described in this study led to universal engraftment with limited toxicity despite T-cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>No patient developed GvHD or late graft failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Lower doses of radiation-containing conditioning should be explored further </plain></SENT>
