<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (A-enzyme) in blood group A persons and galactosyltransferase (B-enzyme) in blood group B persons are responsible for producing A and B substances on the red cell surface, with both enzymes absent in blood group O persons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The plasma transferase (A - and B-) activity was assayed after the complete replacement of the bone marrow of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> by transplantation bone marrow from donors with ABO blood group differing from the recipient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient's blood type completely changed from the recipient's type to the donor's type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the A- and B-enzyme activities of the patients changed only slightly after bone marrow transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that most of the A- and B-enzymes in the circulatory plasma is not derived from the bone marrow, lymphoid, or macrophage tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Other tissues must be the primary source of the enzymes in plasma </plain></SENT>
