<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>UNLABELLED: PURPOSE AND RATIONALE: There has been no previously published experience with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) at doses less than 15 micrograms/m2/d in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, and most observations have been made at doses of 100 to 500 micrograms/m2/d (2.5 to 12.5 micrograms/kg/d) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The benefits of using considerably lower doses, if effective, should include a decrease in cost and in side effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have therefore used very low doses of GM-CSF to treat a group of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additionally, since severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> is often a problem in these patients, we recently started administering erythropoietin along with the GM-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Herein we report the results of very-low-dose GM-CSF therapy in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and our preliminary findings in those individuals who received combination therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We administered recombinant human GM-CSF subcutaneously at doses of 5 to 20 micrograms/m2/d ("very-low-dose GM-CSF") to 12 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, a 13th patient received erythropoietin together with the GM-CSF regimen, and three of the 12 individuals who initially received 1 or more months of GM-CSF alone were later also given erythropoietin (4,000 U/d subcutaneously) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In five of 12 patients (42%) treated with very-low-dose GM-CSF, an increase in neutrophil counts (2.0- to 6.7-fold) was noted, and one of these subjects attained a bilineage response (neutrophil counts, 0.3 to 1.75 x 10(9)/L; platelet counts, 8 to 169 x 10(9)/L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, a sixth patient showed a rise in platelet counts (19 to 80 x 10(9)/L) without a concomitant increase in neutrophils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Constitutional side effects were minimal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Combining erythropoietin and very-low-dose GM-CSF produced a bilineage response (neutrophils, 1.0 to 3.0 x 10(9)/L; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>, 7.4 to 9.4 g/dL) in the one patient who received erythropoietin together with the GM-CSF from the time that GM-CSF was initiated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In one of the other patients who were given combination therapy, the addition of erythropoietin appeared to enhance the response; this patient demonstrated a neutrophil response to GM-CSF alone and a trilineage response (neutrophils, 0.8 to 3.75 x 10(9)/L; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>, 7.0 to 13.1 g/dL; and platelets, 10 to 34 x 10(9)/L) to the combination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No toxicity was associated with the addition of erythropoietin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our observations suggest that (1) very low doses of GM-CSF (5 to 20 micrograms/m2/d subcutaneously) may be used initially in neutropenic patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, and the dose subsequently increased only in patients who do not respond; and (2) the administration of erythropoietin together with GM-CSF is well tolerated, can augment responsiveness in some patients, and deserves further study </plain></SENT>
