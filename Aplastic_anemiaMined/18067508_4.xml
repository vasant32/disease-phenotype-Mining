<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The steadily increasing demands for single-donor apheresis platelet (PLT) concentrates (APCs) are a challenge to the PLT supply system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, efforts to improve plateletpheresis yield, allowing apheresis products to be split into 2 or more units, are valuable strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No data to demonstrate in vivo transfusion efficacy of these high-yield split-APCs are currently available, however </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The transfusion efficacy of APCs produced by two apheresis methods involving different harvest and storing procedures and varying PLT yields was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Efficacy measures were the 1-hour percent PLT recovery (PPR(1h)) and the 1-hour corrected count increment (CCI(1h)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In total, 400 APCs, produced with either an Amicus device (Baxter) and stored in PLT additive solution (T-Sol; Amicus method [AM], n = 107) or a Trima device (Gambro) and stored in plasma (Trima method [TM], n = 293), were transfused to 55 children (31 girls; median age, 9.5 years; range, 0.2-18.5 years) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> due to chemotherapy or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (median, 4 APCs per child; range, 1-68) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Transfusion efficacy was significantly lower for AM-APCs than for TM-APCs (median PPR(1h), 17 and 33%; median CCI(1h), 7.9 and 15.6, respectively; p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Reduced transfusion efficacy correlated in a yield-dependent manner with high apheresis PLT yields (&gt; or =6 x 10(11)) for AM-APCs (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although in vitro validation of AM- and TM-APCs has been performed, only by evaluating transfusion efficacy in vivo did the AM turn out to be not suitable for high-yield thrombocytapheresis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study recommends the implementation of in vivo transfusion efficacy studies for high-yield APC apheresis donations </plain></SENT>
