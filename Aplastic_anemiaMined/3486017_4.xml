<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Peripheral blood cells from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> were tested for their ability to release interleukin-2 (IL-2) and colony stimulating activity (CSA) before treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>IL-2 release--as measured in the mouse thymocyte assay--was abnormally high in 18/34, and abnormally low in 10/34 patients. "Low" release was due to simultaneous release of thymocyte inhibitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 18 patients who achieved self-sustaining hemopoiesis after high dose immunosuppressive therapy, excess IL-2 release decreased to low levels (p less than 0.001), and the release of inhibitors disappeared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the release of CSA by patient cells--which did not correlate with peripheral blood monocyte counts--either remained high or increased to excessively high values in 24/24 patients tested before and after successful immunosuppressive treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with stable hemopoietic grafts after bone marrow transplantation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, did not release excess CSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that IL-2 and CSA play opposite roles in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>High IL-2 release seems associated with disease activity, whereas high CSA-release appears to reflect a repair mechanism </plain></SENT>
