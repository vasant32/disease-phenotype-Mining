<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the response to antithymocyte globulin based immunosuppressive therapy (IST) in pediatric patients with idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty patients (19 boys and 11 girls) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> received antithymocyte globulin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two patients had severe and 8 had very severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mean age of the patients was 9.19 ± 2.56 y </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three patients died within 1 mo of therapy, two due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> and one due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-seven patients were analyzed for response to therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eight patients (29.7%) responded at 3 mo: 3 complete response (CR) and 5 partial response (PR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Six mo after the therapy, overall response (OR) was seen in 9/27 (33.3%), with one more patient in no response group achieving partial response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At 1 year, patients in CR maintained their status and 1 patient in PR group relapsed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>He again achieved partial response with repeat course of ATG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Responders had significantly shorter duration of illness and higher absolute neutrophil count as compared to non responders to IST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>None of the patients developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> in the follow up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> in pediatric patients is a challenging task </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>One third of the patients achieved overall response which included both complete and partial response </plain></SENT>
