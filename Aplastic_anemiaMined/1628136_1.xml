<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The allograft rejection appears to have been induced by recombinant alpha-interferon (rINF-alpha) treatment for non-A, non-B <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> that developed 11 months after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During the 9 months of active <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo>, the donor graft functioned normally; however, 3 months after rINF-alpha therapy was started, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> and a chimeric hematopoietic state developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>rINF-alpha was discontinued, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> was reintroduced, and autologous bone marrow recovery followed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>rINF-alpha treatment may be detrimental to some recipients of allogeneic bone marrow transplants </plain></SENT>
