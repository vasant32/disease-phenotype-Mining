<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>B19 is also suggested as a causative agent of organ failure during bone marrow transplantation (BMT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We herein report the case of a 9-year-old girl with no previous history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> who developed severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> concurrent with B19 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1264606" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">persistent infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both immunoglobulin (Ig)M antibody to B19 and B19 DNA identified by real-time polymerase chain reaction were found in the patient's serum at time of diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No giant proerythroblasts were found in her bone marrow at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although intravenous administration of Ig (IVIg) reduced serum B19 DNA, the aplastic status of her bone marrow did not improve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and persistent B19 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042749" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">viremia</z:e> were successfully treated by BMT from an HLA-identical sibling donor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Serum B19 DNA increased temporarily after BMT; however, neither organ nor marrow failure was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>B19 DNA disappeared from the serum 2 months after BMT, suggesting that a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> immune response was restored by BMT and terminated the B19 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042749" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">viremia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>During BMT, use of high-titer IVIg for B19 might prevent B19-associated organ failure </plain></SENT>
