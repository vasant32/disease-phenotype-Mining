<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To study the bone marrow microvessel density (MVD) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression and their clinical significance in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Bone marrow biopsies in 51 newly diagnosed patients with AA were evaluated the MVD and VEGF expression by immunostaining with anti-factor VIII related antigen and VEGF monoclonal antibodies at regular time points after immunosuppressive therapy (IT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean bone marrow MVD in AA group was 5.5 +/- 3.5, being significantly lower than that in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control group (8.7 +/- 3.4, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MVDs of SAA and NSAA patients were 7.4 +/- 2.9 and 4.3 +/- 3.4, respectively, being significantly different (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The VEGF expression in AA group was significantly lower than that in control group [(6.7 +/- 8.4)% vs (14.7 +/- 6.1)%, P &lt; 0.01], but there was no difference between SAA and NSAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow MVD and VEGF were significantly increased after IT in 22 responded AA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Bone marrow MVD and VEGF expression are low in AA patients which may be one of pathophysiologic mechanisms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> in AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Proangiogenic and ameliorating microcirculation agents together with IT might accelerate the recovery of hematopoiesis in AA patients </plain></SENT>
