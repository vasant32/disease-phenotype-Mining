<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy of high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> in various refractory, severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Prospective phase II study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Johns Hopkins University (Baltimore, Maryland) and Hahnemann University (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Eight patients with refractory, severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intervention: Immunoablative high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (50 mg/kg of body weight per day) for 4 consecutive days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS: Clinical and laboratory variables of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seven patients improved markedly: Five achieved complete remission and two achieved partial remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Four patients have remained in continuous complete remission for 3 to 21 months, and two patients in partial remission continue to improve after 14 and 19 months of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>High-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> was well tolerated; median times to a neutrophil count of 0.5 x 10(9) cells/L and platelet transfusion independence were 17 and 16 days, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Immunoablative high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> without stem-cell rescue can induce complete remission in patients with refractory, severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Reemergence of marrow function is similar to that seen after autologous transplantation and does not carry the risk for reinfusion of autoaggressive lymphocytes with the autograft </plain></SENT>
