<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 1978, on the basis of strong but incomplete data then available on the risk of <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, the U.S </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) reduced the permissible occupational exposure standard for <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> from 10 ppm to 1 ppm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Shortly thereafter, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals stayed this ruling, and in 1980, the Supreme Court overturned the regulation, citing insufficient evidence of benefit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, from 1978 until the standard was again lowered to 1 ppm in 1987, American workers were exposed to <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> at levels in excess of 1 ppm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An estimated 9600 were exposed to levels between 1 and 10 ppm, and an additional 370 were exposed at levels above 10 ppm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To assess the risk resulting from this delay in regulation, we have conducted an epidemiologic risk analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We merged data on numbers of persons (238,000) exposed to <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> in seven occupational categories with dose-response data from three epidemiologic studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The range of risk in these studies indicates that 44 to 152 excess <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> will ultimately result from exposure to <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> at 10 ppm over a working lifetime (45 years) and that lower or briefer exposures will result in proportionately fewer <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On this basis, we calculated that between 30 and 490 excess <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> will ultimately result from occupational exposures to <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> greater than 1 ppm that occurred between 1978 and 1987 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>Deaths</z:hpo> from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> will likely add to this toll </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These data confirm the risk of regulatory delay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>They suggest that the courts, in reviewing public health regulations, must beware of facile cost-benefit arguments and be willing to accept strong evidence of health risk even when such evidence is incomplete </plain></SENT>
