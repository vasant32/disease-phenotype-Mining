<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The treatments included one course of antithymocyte globulin, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi>, danazole and rhG-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three patients had very severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and two had moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One patient relapsed 13 months following the first course of therapy and received a second course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five patients received six courses of treatment and the response rate at 6 months was 83.3% </plain></SENT>
