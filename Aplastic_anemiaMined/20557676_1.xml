<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there are several different preparations of ATG and little is known about the difference of their effects on transplantation outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, in this study, we retrospectively compared the effect of two different rabbit ATG preparations [Thymoglobulin (ATG-G) and ATG-Fresenius (ATG-F)] on immune recovery and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010823" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cytomegalovirus infection</z:e> after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The conditioning regimen was a combination of fludarabine, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, and ATG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Low dose total body irradiation was added in alternative donor transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four patients received ATG-F at 5 mg/kg/day from day -7 to day -3, whereas ATG-G was given at 2.5 mg/kg/day from day -5 to day -2 in three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no graft rejection and no grade II-IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three patients in the ATG-G group developed positive cytomegalovirus antigenemia including two with high-grade antigenemia, whereas two of the four patients in the ATG-F group were persistently negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Immunological evaluation on day 60 revealed that both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell recoveries were delayed in the ATG-G group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings suggested that ATG-G has a stronger immunosuppressive activity than the ATG-F with a dose ratio of 1:2.5 </plain></SENT>
