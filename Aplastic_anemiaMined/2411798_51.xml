<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied the effects of recombinant IFN (r-IFN) on hematopoietic colony formation in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53448">methylcellulose</z:chebi> cultures of human bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both recombinant IFN-gamma (r-IFN-gamma) and recombinant IFN-alpha (r-IFN-alpha) were potent suppressors of myeloid (CFU-C-derived) colony formation, with 50% inhibition occurring at 291 u/ml for r-IFN-gamma and 275 U/ml for r-IFN-alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Small amounts of r-IFN-gamma acted synergistically with r-IFN-alpha; as little as 5 U/ml of r-IFN-gamma increased inhibition of CFU-C-derived colony formation by r-IFN-alpha over threefold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Conversely, small amounts of r-IFN-alpha did not affect inhibition by r-IFN-gamma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Inhibition by r-IFN was highly dependent on culture conditions: reduction of the fetal calf serum concentration from 30% to 20%, a change that did not alter the plating efficiency of control cultures, significantly enhanced the action of r-IFN-gamma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Competition between positive hematopoietic factors and r-IFN was further demonstrated as increasing amounts of human placenta-conditioned media, used as a source of colony-stimulating activity, also partially blocked r-IFN inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To determine if r-IFN could directly inhibit the proliferation of a progenitor cell, cells isolated from immature BFU-E-derived colonies, a population enriched for late erythroid progenitors and free of auxiliary cells, were tested; similar inhibition by r-IFN-gamma was observed with these isolated erythroid progenitors as with total bone marrow CFU-E </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although small amounts of r-IFN-gamma also increased inhibition of bone marrow CFU-E-derived colony formation by r-IFN-alpha, no synergy was demonstrable with isolated erythroid progenitor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, even though r-IFN can directly inhibit proliferation of a progenitor cell, auxiliary cells may be required for synergy between r-IFN-gamma and r-IFN-alpha </plain></SENT>
