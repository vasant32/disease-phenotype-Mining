<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The first cases of Th activation were associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>More recently, a high incidence of Th activation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004810'>congenital hypoplastic anemia</z:hpo> has been reported, along with the finding that 13.5 percent of cord bloods are Th activated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The incidence of Th reactivity in newborn infants was confirmed by studying 200 paired samples of maternal and cord blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two (11%) of the cord samples and 13 (6.5%) of the maternal samples were Th activated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 6 paired samples (6/22), both the mother and child had Th activation, a finding that demonstrates a high degree of concordance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additionally, 3 (6%) of 50 pregnant women were Th positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that Th activation is another of the red cell antigen alterations related to pregnancy </plain></SENT>
