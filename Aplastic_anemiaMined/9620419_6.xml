<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patient had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> with prolonged <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> and was treated with immunosuppressive therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>While she was receiving empirical <z:chebi fb="1" ids="2682">amphotericin B</z:chebi>, a dark crusted lesion developed on her nasal turbinate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Histologic analysis revealed invasive hyaline hyphae and some darkly pigmented structures that resembled conidia of dematiaceous molds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only after the mold was grown in culture were characteristic colonial <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, phialides, conidia, and chlamydospores evident, thus permitting the identification of F. chlamydosporum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This case illustrates the ever-increasing spectrum of pathogenic Fusarium spp. in immunocompromised patients and emphasizes the potential pitfalls in histologic diagnosis, which may have important treatment implications </plain></SENT>
