<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively analyzed the effect of HLA mismatching (HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1, -DQB1) with molecular typing on transplantation outcome for 301 patients with acquired severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (SAA) who received an unrelated BM transplant through the Japan Marrow Donor Program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Additional effect of HLA-DPB1 mismatching was analyzed for 10 of 10 or 9 of 10 HLA allele-matched pairs (n = 169) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of the 301 recipient/donor pairs, 101 (33.6%) were completely matched at 10 of 10 alleles, 69 (23%) were mismatched at 1 allele, and 131 (43.5%) were mismatched at â‰¥ 2 alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subjects were classified into 5 subgroups: complete match group (group I); single-allele mismatch group (groups II and III); multiple alleles restricted to HLA-C, -DRB1, and -DQB1 mismatch group (group IV); and others (group V) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis indicated that only HLA disparity of group V was a significant risk factor for poor survival and grade II-IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HLA-DPB1 mismatching was not associated with any clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We recommend the use of an HLA 10 of 10 allele-matched unrelated donor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, if such a donor is not available, any single-allele or multiple-allele (HLA-C, -DRB1, -DQB1) mismatched donor is acceptable as an unrelated donor for patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
