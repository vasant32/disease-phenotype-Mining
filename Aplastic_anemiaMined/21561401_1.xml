<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To explore whether predisposition to <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> syndromes (BMF), such <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA), <z:hpo ids='HP_0004818'>paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>) and myelosysplastic syndromes (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), is found in killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) ligand (KIR-L) gene variations or cytokine polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: We studied a cohort of 77 patients with AA, 129 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and 285 healthy controls for the frequencies of KIR-L and KIR genotypes and 22 selected single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located within 10 cytokine (IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL12, IFN- γ, TNF- α, TGF- β) and 3 cytokine receptor (IL-1R, IL-1RA, IL-4Rα) genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In AA we found a decreased frequency of inhibitory KIR-2DL3 genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, no difference in the frequency of KIR genotype was identified; however, a decreased frequency of 2DL3 was found in hypocellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the KIR genotype in correlation with the corresponding KIR-L profile, revealed a decreased frequency of stimulatory 2DS1/C2 mismatch both in AA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In AA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cohorts, compared to controls, we found a higher frequency of TT codon 10 variant and of GG codon 25 variant of TGF- β gene, consistent with a high secretory phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This relationship was even more pronounced in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> and hypocellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We confirm that the hypersecretory genotype T/T at position -874 of INF-γ gene was overrepresented only in AA and correlates with presence of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> clone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Instead in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, the frequency of G/A polymorphism at position -308 on the TNF- α gene promoter, which correlates with higher TNF- α production, was found significantly higher </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, hypocellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> was characterized by a higher prevalence of IL-10 GCC/GCC haplotype, which is functionally associated with a low secretor phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that alterations in KIR/KIR-L matching, such as increased 3DL2 and decreased 2DS1 mismatch, and in the polymorphisms of TGFβ1, IFN-γ, TNF- α and IL-10 may account for the propensity to immunemediated killing of hematopoietic stem cells and/or ineffective hematopoiesis characteristic of AA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed to elucidate whether these immunogenetic traits may be involved in increased risk of developing immune-mediated BMF </plain></SENT>
