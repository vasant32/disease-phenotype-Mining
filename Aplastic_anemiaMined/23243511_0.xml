<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Eighty-six patients suffering from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiencies</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemias</z:hpo> received alloHSCT from unrelated donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Donors were selected from the BMDW files and further matching was performed according to the confirmatory typing procedure with the use of PCR SSP and that based on sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The time from the clinical request of the donor search to the final decision of clinicians accepting the donor was from 0.3 to 17.8 months (median 1.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Matching was analyzed at the allele level, and 50, 27, and 9 donor-recipient pairs were 10/10 matched, mismatched in one or more alleles, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In an univariate analysis we found better survival if patients were transplanted: (i) from donors matched 10/10 (P = 0.025), (ii) not from female donor to male recipient (P = 0.037), (iii) in female donation from those with â‰¤1 pregnancy than multiparous (P = 0.075) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Notably, it became apparent that duration of the confirmatory typing process affected the survival (HR = 1.138, P = 0.013) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis only the level of matching and the duration of the matching procedure significantly affected the survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the duration of the matching procedure in addition to the level of matching should be considered as an independent risk factor of survival </plain></SENT>
