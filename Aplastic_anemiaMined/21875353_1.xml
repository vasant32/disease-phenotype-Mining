<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to describe a serious complication of acupuncture treatment in a high-risk patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: A 44-year-old woman with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> experienced right calf pain after running </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After poor results with physical therapy, she received needle acupuncture for pain relief </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, aggravated pain with swelling of the right calf developed 2 days later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: On admission, she had a temperature of 38.8°C, a white blood cell count of 500/μL, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> of 5.7 g/dL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ultrasound and computed tomography scans showed swelling of the right calf muscle fascia, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> drew out <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038160" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Staphylococcus infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The symptoms improved after treatment with parenteral antibiotics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This case illustrates that necrotizing <z:hpo ids='HP_0100537'>fasciitis</z:hpo> must be considered as a possible complication of acupuncture in high-risk patients, and that early recognition and treatment of this life-threatening <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149778" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">soft-tissue infection</z:e> must be emphasized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Extreme caution should be employed when using acupuncture for high-risk patients, such as those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
