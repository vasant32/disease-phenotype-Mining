<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The existence of T cells capable of inhibiting in vitro hematopoiesis has been shown in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA), although whether such inhibition is mediated by a specific immune reaction involving an HLA allele remained unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We isolated a CD4+ Vbeta21+ T-cell clone that was most dominant among Vbeta21+ T cells in the bone marrow (BM) of an AA patient whose HLA-DRB1 alleles included 1501 and 0405 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The T-cell clone named NT4.2 lysed an autologous Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL) and phytohemagglutinin-stimulated lymphocytes (PHA-blasts) as well as allogeneic LCLs sharing HLA-DRB1*0405 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cytotoxicity against LCL cells and PHA-blasts by NT4.2 was blocked by anti-HLA-DR monoclonal antibody (MoAb) or anti-CD3 MoAb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>NT4.2 also lysed autologous BM mononuclear cells enriched with CD34+ cells that had been cultured for one week in the presence of colony-stimulating factors as well as allogeneic CD34+ cells of a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individual carrying HLA-DRB1*0405, cultured in the same way </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, NT4.2 strongly inhibited colony formation by hematopoietic progenitor cells derived from cultured CD34+ cells sharing HLA-DRB1*0405 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that the AA patient has T cells capable of killing hematopoietic cells in an HLA-DRB1*0405-restricted manner and that such cytotoxic T cells may contribute to the pathogenesis of AA </plain></SENT>
