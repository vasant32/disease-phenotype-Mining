<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patient had <z:hpo ids='HP_0100753'>schizophrenia</z:hpo> in adolescence, and suffered from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> in late middle age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, he took little food due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000746'>delusions</z:hpo> for 18 months until his <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>He had <z:hpo ids='HP_0004395'>malnutrition</z:hpo> resulting in severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0003075'>hypoproteinemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>He developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001288'>gait disturbance</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001284'>loss of deep tendon reflexes</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003401'>paresthesia</z:hpo> of limbs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neuropathological examination disclosed tract degeneration confined to the bilateral spinal posterior columns, in addition to the findings of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and hypoxic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> in the cerebrum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The myelin and axons were severely affected throughout the spinal cord; status spongiosus with many fatty-laden macrophages was seen in these lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Neurons in the posterior column nuclei were intact, while the dorsal roots and their ganglia were moderately affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The unusual distribution and extension of the degeneration of the bilateral posterior columns in the poor nutritional state is discussed </plain></SENT>
