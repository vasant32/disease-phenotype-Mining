<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In an attempt to characterize aplastic patients likely to benefit from CyA therapy, we examined bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMC) obtained before therapy from 23 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, who were treated with CyA alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Expression of four myelosuppressive cytokines, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor (TNF), lymphotoxin, macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha (MIP-1 alpha), and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) was examined using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-assisted <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>) amplification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> for TNF, lymphotoxin, and MIP-1 alpha was readily detectable at variable levels in BMMC from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and transfused controls as well as in BMMC from aplastic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, IFN-gamma <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was only demonstrable in BMMC from some patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, irrespective of a history of transfusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of 13 patients who responded to CyA therapy and achieved transfusion-independence, IFN-gamma <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was detected in 12 patients, whereas the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was only detectable in 3 of 10 patients refractory to CyA therapy (P = .003, Fisher's exact test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Follow-up examination of BMMC obtained from seven CyA-responding patients after hematologic remission showed disappearance of IFN-gamma <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in four patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that detection of IFN-gamma gene expression in pretreatment BMMC from aplastic patients using PCR may be helpful in predicting a good response to CyA therapy </plain></SENT>
