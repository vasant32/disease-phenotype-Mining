<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effect produced by the intravenous administration of collargol on the bone marrow of rabbits varies directly with the amount of collargol injected, and three fairly well defined stages could be recognized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>(a) An initial stage after comparatively few and small doses, with erythrocytic and endothelial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> in the bone marrow and with evidences of this stimulation in the peripheral blood in the form of young erythrocytes and normoblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>(b) An intermediary stage which followed the injection of larger amounts of collargol, and which was characterized by a predominant <z:mp ids='MP_0010373'>myeloid hyperplasia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>(c) A final stage with marked bone marrow <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> and with colloidal silver deposited in endothelial cells, as well as in clasmatocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This was associated with a high grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> with low color index, resembling <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> in its main features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This stage terminated fatally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no evidence of injury to blood cells in the peripheral circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The erythrocytic bone marrow <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> was present before any appreciable decrease of red blood cells was found in the peripheral blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The results were less clear-cut in a series of rats, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> of a similar type was produced in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> animals when sufficiently large doses were injected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Splenectomy did not alter the course in rats materially </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>It is fair to conclude that the cause of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> produced may be sought in the deviation of the parental endothelial cell toward clasmatocyte formation at the expense of the development of erythrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that the results may be offered in support of the theory of the endothelial origin of both clasmatocytes and red blood cells </plain></SENT>
