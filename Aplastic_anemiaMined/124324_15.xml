<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 56-year-old man developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002728'>chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis</z:hpo> (MCC) and pernicious <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nine years later he developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> which ultimately was fatal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A small <z:hpo ids='HP_0100522'>thymoma</z:hpo> was found at autopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>He was anergic and his mononuclear leukocytes (MNL) failed to undergo a proliferative response in culture to soluble antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>His monocytes did not mediate a proliferative response by lymphocytes from sensitized control donors when stimulated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006840" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Monilia</z:e> albicans antigen but did mediate a mixed leukocyte reaction normally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>His plasma contained a poten inhibitor of -3H-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> incorporation by sensitized control MNL when stimulated with soluble antigens but was not inhibitory of the mixed leukocyte reaction, lymphoproliferative responses to plant <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogens</z:chebi>, and was not shown either in vivo or in vitro to depress hematopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patient lymphocytes were responsive to plant <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogens</z:chebi>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006840" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Monilia</z:e> antigen, in the mixed leukocyte reaction, and produced macrophage migration inhibitory factor in response to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006840" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Monilia</z:e> antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After plasmapheresis, delayed hypersensitivity and lymphoproliferative responses to soluble antigens were temporarily restored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This case implicates the macrophage in the pathogenesis of MCC and demonstrates some consequences of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> monocyte dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The inhibitor of some expressions of cell-mediated immunity was removed by plasmapheresis </plain></SENT>
