<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The transfusion of foreign blood products (expressing non-self histocompatibility antigens) leads to an immune response in the transfusion recipient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This may result in a memory response to subsequent transfusions, and in patients undergoing marrow transplantation for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> in an increased risk of marrow graft rejection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have used the canine model of marrow transplantation as an in vivo indicator system for the occurrence of post transfusion sensitization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our results show that sensitization can occur in response not only to major histocompatibility complex (DLA) antigens but also to minor (non-DLA) antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our studies suggest that the antigens involved are probably expressed on leukocytes but not on RBC and platelets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among leukocytes the sensitizing population appears to be contained within mononuclear cells, presumably large Ia positive cells which show accessory cell function in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The responsible antigens are apparently not expressed on T lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our findings are in agreement with the hypothesis that dendritic cells play a central role in transfusion-induced sensitization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Their sensitizing ability can be abrogated by exposure to UV light prior to transfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is conceivable that exposure to UV light alters the function of Ia antigens which in turn results in defective antigen presentation and consequently a lack of sensitization of the recipient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Alternatively non-DLA antigens on donor cells could be modified by exposure to UV light thus escaping recognition by the recipient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The exact mechanism remains to be determined </plain></SENT>
