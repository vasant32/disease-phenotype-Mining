<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An efficient diagnostic plan is important because time from diagnosis to 'final' treatment is directly related to outcome regardless of the therapeutic option chosen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The gold standard of therapy remains hematopoietic SCT with a graft of BM cells for those children with matched sibling donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Conversely for children without a sibling donor the high response and markedly improved overall survival rates of combined immunosuppressive therapy have proven robust, especially when horse derived anti-thymocyte globuline plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">ciclosporine</z:chebi> A are used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Incomplete response, relapse and progression to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> however have emerged as significant long-term issues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Improvements in outcome of alternative donor transplantation and the use of established and novel <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressive agents</z:chebi> provide multiple alternatives for treating refractory or relapsed patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Regardless of the type of therapeutic approach, patients require centralized treatment in a center of excellence, ongoing monitoring for recurrence of disease and/or therapy-related immediate side effects and long-term effects </plain></SENT>
