<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have previously shown that the levels of hematopoietic progenitors in long-term marrow cultures (LTMC) from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) are drastically reduced, as compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> LTMC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have also reported that when LTMC from AA patients are supplemented with recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rhGM-CSF) there is an increase in colony-forming cell (CFC) levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, such a stimulation is only transient and it is followed by an inhibition in CFC growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Based on these observations, in the present study we have tested the hypothesis that the levels of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), an inhibitor of hematopoiesis, are increased in AA LTMC and that such levels are further increased after rhGM-CSF has been added to the cultures for several weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, we have determined the levels of TNF-alpha in the supernatant of LTMC established from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (n = 8) and AA (n = 6) bone marrow and in AA LTMC supplemented with rhGM-CSF (n = 6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At the time of culture initiation, TNF-alpha levels were below detection in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the samples analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After 5 weeks of culture, TNF-alpha levels in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> LTMC were very low, with a median of 7.3 pg/mL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, AA LTMC contained higher levels of TNF-alpha (median of 49.6 pg/mL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In keeping with our hypothesis, addition of rhGM-CSF to AA LTMC resulted in a significant further increase of TNF-alpha levels (median of 135.4 pg/mL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrate an inverse correlation between <z:mp ids='MP_0001606'>reduced hematopoiesis</z:mp> in AA LTMC and increased levels of TNF-alpha in this culture system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Based on the results presented here, together with previous reports indicating that TNF-alpha is a potent inducer of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in hematopoietic progenitor cells, it seems reasonable to suggest that TNF-alpha is implicated in the pathophysiology of AA </plain></SENT>
