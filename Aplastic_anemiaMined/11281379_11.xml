<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Intensification of the conditioning regimen, with the inclusion of irradiation, has often been advocated to combat this problem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With this approach engraftment rate improved, but the incidence of transplant-related complications is also increased, resulting in little change in the overall outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated the use of the combination of fludarabine, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> and anti-thymocyte globulin as the conditioning regimen in five multiply-transfused SAA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three patients received an HLA one-antigen disparate related donor transplant, while two patients were given marrow from matched, unrelated donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The regimen was well tolerated, with only grade I toxicity encountered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up of 9 months, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients are alive with complete donor chimerism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that fludarabine may be used in place of irradiation to augment the conditioning regimen of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> and anti-thymocyte globulin for alternative donor transplantation in children with SAA </plain></SENT>
