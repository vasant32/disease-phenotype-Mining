<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The current working hypothesis on the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> focuses on the interactions between susceptibility genes and environmental stimuli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018213" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Graves' disease</z:e> it is postulated that aberrant expression of HLA class II antigens on thyroid epithelial cells permits the presentation of specific thyroid antigen to activated lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Evidence suggests that thyrocyte HLA-DR expression is secondary to the production of cytokines by presensitized T-lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A 20-yr-old woman and her 18-yr-old brother presented with classical findings of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018213" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Graves' disease</z:e> with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015397" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ophthalmopathy</z:e> within a year of each other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis was confirmed by demonstration of elevated serum levels of T4 and T3, strongly positive titers of TSH binding inhibitory immunoglobulins, and histological examination after subtotal thyroidectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eight years previously, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> life-threatening <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> in the brother led to therapeutic transplantation of bone marrow from his sister </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After the procedure, 100% of his peripheral leucocytes were genotype 46,XX </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>HLA typing performed before transplantation and 2 months after thyroidectomy in the female indicated complete identity with her brother's leukocytes for class I and class II antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thyroid autoantibodies at this time were weakly positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although the concordance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000820'>thyroid disease</z:hpo> in these patients could be due to chance, the patients were of different sexes, the family history was negative, and neither the probands nor the first degree relatives bore the HLA-DR3/B8 antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We propose that the male passively acquired a clone of programmed or activated lymphocytes from his sister and that his <z:hpo ids='HP_0000836'>hyperthyroidism</z:hpo> was not primarily dependent on exposure to specific thyroid-derived antigen </plain></SENT>
