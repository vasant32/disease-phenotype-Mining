<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because GSLs are often cryptic antigens on cell membranes, little is known regarding GSL expression in early myelopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To study the latter, myeloblasts were collected from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> nonlymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (ANLL) who required therapeutic leukocytopheresis for hyperleukocytosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The neutral GSLs were isolated and identified by high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC), HPTLC immunostaining, gas chromatography, nuclear magnetic resonance, and fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Like mature peripheral blood neutrophils, myeloblasts expressed glucosylceramide, lactosylceramide, and the neolacto-family GSLs, lactotriaosylceramide and neolactotetraosylceramide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Unlike neutrophils and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, most ANLL samples also expressed the globo-series GSLs, globotriaosylceramide and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18259">globotetraosylceramide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Globo GSL expression was strongly associated with a myeloblastic (ANLL M0-M2) and monoblastic phenotype (M5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A weak association was also noted with expression of either lymphoid (P &lt;.10) or early hematopoietic markers (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase [TdT], CD34; P &lt;.10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Globo-positive ANLL samples bound both shiga toxin and parvovirus B19 on HPTLC immunostaining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Based on these findings, we propose that neolacto and globo GSLs are expressed during early myeloid differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Globotriaosylceramide expression on myeloblasts, and possibly myeloid stem cells, may have important implications for the use of shiga toxin as an ex vivo purging agent in autologous stem cell transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Expression of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18259">globotetraosylceramide</z:chebi>, the parvovirus B19 receptor, on myeloblasts may also explain the association between B19 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> of childhood </plain></SENT>
