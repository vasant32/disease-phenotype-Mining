<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Significantly low serum <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> levels are occasionally seen at the time of diagnosis in children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to clarify the pathologic and clinical significance of pretreatment serum <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> levels in AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A questionnaire seeking precise data about AA in pediatric patients, including the initial laboratory data at the time of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of AA and the clinical course of these patients, was sent to 18 institutes in Japan; 13 institutes responded to the questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this retrospective study, data concerning hematologic examination and serum <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi> were available for analysis in 127 children with AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> patterns were analyzed using conventional <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2511">agarose</z:chebi> electrophoresis in eight patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In order to elucidate the cause of hypolipidemia in AA, we assayed serum macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF), which is well known to have apparent cholesterol-lowering activity, by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in seven patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003146'>hypocholesterolemia</z:hpo> and compared the results with those obtained in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001891'>iron-deficiency anemia</z:hpo> (IDA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found that pretreatment total cholesterol (TC) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triglyceride</z:chebi> levels in the serum correlated well with counts of both nucleated cells and hemopoietic cells in the bone marrow (BM) and were inversely correlated with the lymphocyte ratio in both the BM and peripheral blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with serum TC lower than 150 mg/dL showed a poor response to any form of therapy except BM transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in the serum <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> patterns between the controls and patients examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The serum M-CSF level was significantly higher in patients with TC levels lower than 150 mg/dL compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that the pretreatment serum <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> level may reflect hematopoietic activity within the BM and can help to predict the therapeutic response of each case of AA to treatment with immunosuppressive drugs, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1456831" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">anabolic steroids</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results also indicate that M-CSF may be one of the contributing causes of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003146'>hypocholesterolemia</z:hpo> that occurs in both AA and IDA </plain></SENT>
