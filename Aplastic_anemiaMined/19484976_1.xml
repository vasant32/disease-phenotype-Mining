<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the osteogenic and adipogenic difference of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) between patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) and healthy volunteers and to explore the role of MSCs adipo-differentiation in the pathogenetic mechanism of AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: MSCs were isolated from bone marrow of patients with AA and healthy donors and expanded in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MSCs derived from the AA patients and healthy volunteers were compared with respect to <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, in vitro proliferation capacity, phenotype, differentiation ability and gene expression during differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The MSCs clones in the AA patients were (19.30 +/- 4.77)/(5 x 10(5) MNCs)7 days after culture, being significantly lower than those in the healthy volunteers, which was (47.72 +/- 3.46)/(5 x 10(5) MSCs) (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared with those the healthy donors, MSCs from the AA patients had similar proliferative capacity in the first 8 passages and then decreased in the following passages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MSCs from different sources had the same phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MSCs from the AA patients could differentiate more easily into adipocytes but less easily and slower into osteoblasts than those from the healthy volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The increased adipogenic capacity and decreased osteogenic capacity of MSCs in AA patients may contribute to the development and progress of AA </plain></SENT>
