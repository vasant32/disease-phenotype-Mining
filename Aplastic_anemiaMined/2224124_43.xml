<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Thirty-two patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) have been studied using the long-term bone marrow culture (LTBMC) system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of these patients, 26 had been treated with immunosuppressive therapy including antilymphocyte globulin (ALG) with or without <z:chebi fb="5" ids="50113">androgens</z:chebi> or high-dose <z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The remaining six patients either required no treatment or were studied before therapy was begun </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty-one of 32 patients (96%) had defective hematopoiesis in LTBMC with little or no evidence for the generation of primitive progenitor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The only exception was a patient with spontaneous recovery of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> in whom the defect was less marked </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Crossover LTBMC experiments were performed in 23 cases by inoculating (1) patient marrow hematopoietic cells that had been depleted of adherent cells onto preformed, irradiated, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> stromas to assess the proliferative capacity of the hematopoietic cells, and (2) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> marrow hematopoietic cells that were depleted of adherent cells onto preformed, irradiated stromas from patients with AA to assess stromal function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results of these experiments demonstrated a hematopoietic defect in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients that was independent of the degree of hematologic recovery after ALG therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only one patient had a probable stromal defect and this coexisted with a defect in the regenerative capacity of hematopoietic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that LTBMC is a sensitive method for detecting and defining the hematopoietic failure in AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We suggest that the defective hematopoiesis present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients studied may be important in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516669" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">clonal evolution</z:e> in AA </plain></SENT>
