<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We describe the molecular cloning of an anemogenic feline <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> virus (FeLV), FeLV-C-Sarma, from the productively infected human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002859'>rhabdomyosarcoma</z:hpo> cell line RD(FeLV-C-S) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Molecularly cloned FeLV-C-S proviral DNA yielded infectious virus (mcFeLV-C-S) after transfection of mammalian cells, and virus interference studies using transfection-derived virus demonstrated that our clone encodes FeLV belonging to the C subgroup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>mcFeLV-C-S did not induce <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042749" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">viremia</z:e> in eight 8-week-old outbred specific-pathogen-free (SPF) cats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It did, however, induce <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042749" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">viremia</z:e> and a rapid, fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> due to profound suppression of erythroid stem cell growth in 9 of 10 inoculated newborn, SPF cats within 3 to 8 weeks (21 to 58 days) postinoculation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, the genome of mcFeLV-C-S encodes the determinants responsible for the genetically dominant induction of irreversible erythroid <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> in outbred cats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A potential clue to the pathogenic determinants of this virus comes from previous work indicating that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> FeLV isolates belonging to the C subgroup, an envelop-gene-determined property, and only those belonging to the C subgroup, are potent, consistent inducers of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> in cats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To approach the molecular mechanism underlying the induction of this disease, we first determined the nucleotide sequence of the envelope genes and 3' long terminal repeat of FeLV-C-S and compared it with that of FeLV-B-Gardner-Arnstein (mcFeLV-B-GA), a subgroup-B feline <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> virus that consistently induces a different disease, myelodysplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, in neonatal SPF cats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our analysis revealed that the p15E genes and long terminal repeats of the two FeLV strains are highly homologous, whereas there are major differences in the gp70 proteins, including five regions of significant amino acid differences and apparent sequence substitution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Some of these changes are also reflected in predicted glycosylation sites; the gp70 protein of FeLV-B-GA has 11 potential glycosylation sites, only 8 of which are present in FeLV-C-S </plain></SENT>
