<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Six healthy volunteers served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Multiple measurements in the volunteers demonstrated reproducibility within errors of 5% for fat fraction and 6% for T1 of water </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ten patients who had histologically proved <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> were then examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The data show that changes in fat fraction represent the underlying reason for many of the changes observed in conventional spin-echo (SE) images of these disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although both conventional and chemical shift images showed differences among the pathologic groups and healthy volunteers, fat fraction determined with chemical shift imaging was the single best discriminator among them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A two-point estimate of fat fraction was also evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This rapid imaging protocol performed almost as well as the complete quantitative analysis in discriminating between pathologic and healthy tissue and showed improved discrimination compared with conventional SE techniques </plain></SENT>
