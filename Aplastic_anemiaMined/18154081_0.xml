<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The content of erythroclasic clusters with exocytic lysis of erythrocytes varied from 21% of total erythroclasic clusters in bone marrow of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> to 81% in bone marrow of patients with an active phase of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> showing high intensity of <z:mp ids='MP_0010163'>hemolysis</z:mp> in the bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Most intensive lysis of erythrocytes in erythroclasic clusters took place in the bone marrow of patients in an active stage of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> and patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At the time of the investigation tens of thousands of erythrocytes were undergoing destruction in erythroclasic clusters in one mcl of bone marrow of such patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings confirm the idea of the bone marrow as an organ of erythrocyte destruction </plain></SENT>
