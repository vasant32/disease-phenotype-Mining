<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Comparison of colony stimulation by purified human Epo and crude urinary extracts revealed: (1) that the pure Epo augments megakaryocyte colony formation in culture and (2) MEG-CSF activity is also present in materials other than Epo in the crude urinary extracts from the two types of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Similar to purification of Epo, <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> precipitation and sulfopropyl-Sephadex chromatography provided twofold and threefold increases in the specific activity of MEG-CSF, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast to Epo, however, significant inactivation of MEG-CSF activity was seen with <z:chebi fb="43" ids="15882">phenol</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The elution profile of MEG-CSF seen on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52255">hydroxylapatite</z:chebi> chromatography of urinary extracts was different from that of Epo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data provided a basis for initial steps for purification of MEG-CSF and support the notion that MEG-CSF is distinct from Epo </plain></SENT>
