<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Transplantations occurred in 1997 to 2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rates of neutrophil and platelet recovery were not different among the 3 treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Grade 2-4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (aGVHD) (relative risk [RR] = 0.82, P = .539), grade 3-4 aGVHD (RR = 0.74, P = .535), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD (cGVHD) (RR = 1.56, P = .229) were similar after G-BM and BM transplants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Grade 2-4 aGVHD (RR = 2.37, P = .012) but not grade 3-4 aGVHD (RR = 1.66, P = .323) and cGVHD (RR = 5.09, P &lt; .001) were higher after PBPC transplants compared to G-BM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Grade 2-4 (RR = 2.90, P &lt; .001), grade 3-4 (RR = 2.24, P = .009) aGVHD and cGVHD (RR = 3.26, P &lt; .001) were higher after PBPC transplants compared to BM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mortality risks were lower after transplantation of BM compared to G-BM (RR = 0.63, P = .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data suggest no advantage to using G-BM and the observed higher rates of aGVHD and cGVHD in PBPC recipients warrants cautious use of this graft source for SAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Taken together, BM is the preferred graft for HLA-matched sibling transplants for SAA </plain></SENT>
