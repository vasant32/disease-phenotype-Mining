<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Excessive telomere shortening has been demonstrated in inherited and acquired <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">blood disorders</z:e>, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is possible that replicative exhaustion, owing to critical telomere shortening in hematopoietic progenitor cells (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HPCs</z:e>), contributes to the development of cytopenias in these disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However to date, a direct link between the telomere length (TL) of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HPCs</z:e> and their proliferative potential has not been demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present investigation, the TL and level of telomerase enzyme activity (TA) detected in cord blood (CB)-derived <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HPCs</z:e> was found to predict erythroid expansion (P&lt;0.01 and P=0.01 respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results were corroborated by a correlation between proliferation of erythroid cells and telomere loss (P=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, no correlations were found between initial TL, telomere loss or TA and the expansion of other myeloid lineage-committed cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was also no correlation between TL or TA and the number of clonogenic progenitors, including primitive progenitors derived from long-term culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our investigations revealed upregulation of telomerase to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell levels in CD34- cells undergoing erythroid differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Together, these results provide new insight into the regulation of TL and TA during myeloid cell expansion and demonstrate that TL is an important determinant of CB-derived erythroid cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
