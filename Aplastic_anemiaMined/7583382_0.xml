<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: We prospectively evaluated the ability of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the thoraco-lumbar vertebrae to determine the relative amount of red and fatty marrow in children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty pediatric patients (ages 1-19 years) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> underwent T1-weighted (T1W, n = 31) and short T1 inversion recovery (STIR, n = 30) MRI of the midline sagittal thoraco-lumbar spine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow (BM) biopsies from the posterior iliac crest (n = 29) were also performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> studies were evaluated by blinded observers; <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> grading was based on visual inspection of signal intensity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Biopsy-estimated cellularity was compared with T1W and STIR grading when these were performed within 14 days of each other (n = 16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> studies were compared to a simultaneous absolute neutrophil count (ANC), absolute reticulocyte count (ARC), and platelet count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: BM cellularity estimated by BM biopsy was significantly associated with STIR grading (p = 0.032, Jonckheere-Terpstra test), as were peripheral ANC (p = 0.044), ARC (p = 0.007), and platelet count (p = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>T1W grade was significantly associated with ANC (P = 0.011) but not ARC (p = 0.053) or platelet count (p = 0.377) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Biopsy-estimated cellularity was associated with ANC (p = 0.032) and ARC (p = 0.036), but not platelet count (p = 0.282) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> patients, STIR (and, to a lesser extent, T1W) MRI of the thoraco-lumbar spine reflects BM activity, as measured by peripheral blood ANC, ARC, and platelet count, and BM cellularity, as measured by BM biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>MRI may thus provide a noninvasive measure of hematopoietic status </plain></SENT>
