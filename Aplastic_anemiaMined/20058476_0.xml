<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The functional definition of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) is the failure of hematopoietic stem cells to proliferate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to analyze the S-phase fraction (SPF) (proliferative activity) in patients with AA at diagnosis to explore its relationship with disease characteristics and its value in discriminating among patients with different prognoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also investigated whether the SPF value influenced the response to immunosuppressive therapy in AA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The analysis of SPF at the time of diagnosis was carried out by flow cytometry on peripheral blood samples from 53 consecutive patients with AA and 30 age- and sex-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were given <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> and followed up periodically to determine response to therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Based on the median SPF, AA patients were divided into two groups: patients with SPF &lt; 0.59% (n = 27) and patients with SPF &gt; 0.59% (n = 26) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An SPF &gt; 0.59% was associated with advanced age (P = .02) and elevated serum LDH level (P = .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with an SPF &gt; 0.59% also had a higher incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004818'>paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</z:hpo> and cytogenetic abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During a median follow-up of 18 months, 3.7% of patients with SPF &lt; or = 0.59 and 11.5% of patients with SPF &gt; 0.59% developed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> and one patient with SPF &gt; 0.59% converted into <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A significantly higher (P = .018) overall response rate of 53.9% was found in patients with SPF &gt; 0.59% versus 22.2% of patients with SPF &lt; or = 0.59% at 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Independently of the peripheral blood count, the SPF at diagnosis may provide information on the expected response to immunosuppressive therapy and the propensity for disease to evolve into <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Hence, SPF may serve as an early indicator for the evolution of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> in patients with AA and thus contribute to therapeutic decisions </plain></SENT>
