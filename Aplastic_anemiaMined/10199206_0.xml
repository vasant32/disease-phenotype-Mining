<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 44-year-old man was admitted because of persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because his bone marrow was hypoplastic and the karyotype of his marrow cells was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, he was given a diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, and treated with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoids</z:chebi> and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001744'>Splenomegaly</z:hpo> was later found and a splenectomy performed: pathological findings on resected tissue specimens disclosed non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, B-cell diffuse large </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient was transferred to our hospital, where a bone marrow biopsy revealed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells infiltrating his <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151773" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoplastic marrow</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Complex chromosomal abnormalities were detected in marrow cells, but no <z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>lymphadenopathy</z:hpo> was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A diagnosis of primary splenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> with infiltration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells into bone marrow was made, and chemotherapy was accordingly started </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After multiple cycles of chemotherapy, the patient's marrow recovered to a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> state and his karyotype abnormalities disappeared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Six months later, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> reappeared and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells were again detected in the patient's bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We reasoned that the hypoplastic state of his bone marrow was associated with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and that cytokines, including interferon-gamma, may have been responsible for this association </plain></SENT>
