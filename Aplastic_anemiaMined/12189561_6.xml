<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>According to the traditional concept of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo> the target tissue in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> is essentially <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, and misdirected self-attack is caused by disturbed self-recognition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, this theory has been challenged by the hypothesis that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo> against solid tissues is directed against intrinsically abnormal, transforming cells, i.e. autoimmune reactions are essentially <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35610">antineoplastic</z:chebi>, attempting to eliminate cells signalling 'danger' </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This theory might apply to AA as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Observations such as the dysplastic traits typical of non-severe AA, the high prevalence of one or several abnormal hematopoietic clones and their resistance to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in newly diagnosed AA patients suggest that these cell populations do not develop secondarily, but expand primarily und could be the primary target of AA, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hematopoietic stem cells being destroyed as innocent bystanders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>If <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow hypoplasia</z:hpo>/<z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> indeed reflects an immune reaction incited by outgrowth of transformed cells, immunosuppressive treatment of AA would have to be reconsidered, since a two-edged sword </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As a consequence, AA patients with a hyperreactive immune system may require more intense immunosuppressive therapy (IS), whereas patients with an anergic immune system may fare better with IS of lower intensity than the currently recommended standard </plain></SENT>
