<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirty-eight patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> who received ALG-based therapy at a single institute in Taiwan were analyzed, and 28 were followed up for more than 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four patients (10.5%) had a complete response, and 11 (28.9%) had a partial response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The overall response rate was 39.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The significant prognostic factor that affected the response to IS therapy was a positive test result for antibodies to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> C virus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The rate of early mortality (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> within 90 days after initiation of ALG-based therapy) was 15.8%, and most <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were secondary to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Factors influencing the risk of early mortality were old age, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004610" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bacteremia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, ALG-based IS therapy was effective for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> in Chinese patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The role of <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> C associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and its relationship to IS need to be clarified by further investigations </plain></SENT>
