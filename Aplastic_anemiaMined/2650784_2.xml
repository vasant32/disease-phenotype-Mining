<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Estimated 10-year survival was 85% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Preceding <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD had a dominating influence on the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with grades II-IV and 67% of those with grade I <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among patients without previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD, three factors were independently correlated with an increased risk of de novo <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD: increasing patient age, the infusion of buffy coat cells in addition to the marrow, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> therapy before transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For example, patients below and above age 20 years who had neither buffy coat cell transfusions nor preceding <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> therapy had an incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD of only 4-8%, while those with either buffy coat cell transfusions or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> or both had incidence rates of 33-70% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD significantly influenced survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among 83 patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD, only one died (on day 150 with interstitial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo>), compared to 23 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> among 82 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD </plain></SENT>
