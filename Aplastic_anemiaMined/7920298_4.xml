<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The commonest indications were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039730" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thalassemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Campaigns promoting an unrelated marrow donor registry were started in August 1993 and recruited approximately 26,000 volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A peripheral stem cell program is just beginning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The overall results of BMT in Taiwan are comparable to other countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The complications of BMT are similar to Western series, except that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD was rarer in one large series; this observation needs further study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A particular indication for allogeneic BMT in Taiwan is <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039730" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thalassemia</z:e>, accounting for 10% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Disease-free survival after BMT for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039730" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thalassemia</z:e> is 44%; graft rejection is the major cause of treatment failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Another important issue is the role of <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> B virus (HBV) in BMT, since the prevalence of HBV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> in Taiwan is very high (&gt; 90%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002910'>Abnormal liver function</z:hpo> is currently the most common complication and might be related to HBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Among nearly 100 allogeneic BMTs with HBV carriers as either donor or recipient, 2 patients (approximately 2%) died of HBV-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0001399'>hepatic failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Whether the HBV status of the donor and recipient is an important prognostic factor remains to be defined </plain></SENT>
