<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied three male patients, two with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and one with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo>, who received transplants from their histoincompatible mothers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MLC studies between donors and recipients showed varying degrees of stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Definite engraftment occurred in one patient and transient engraftment in another </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Engraftment in the third patient could not be evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the patient with sustained engraftment, there was clinical evidence of severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft versus host disease</z:e> (GVHD) however, this was not substantiated by histologic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This preliminary study suggests that MLC incompatibility may be more of an indicator of the risk of GVHD than of bone marrow rejection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>If more effective control of GVHD can be accomplished, marrow transplantation between MLC-reactive individuals may become feasible </plain></SENT>
