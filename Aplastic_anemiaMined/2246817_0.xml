<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We treated 14 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (6 severe, 8 moderate) who did not respond to high dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi>, antilymphocyte globulin, or anabolic steroid with cyclosporin (CyA) for more than 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Four of them (29%) showed clinical improvement to transfusion-independence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The response rate of patients who received CyA more than 5 weeks was 50% (4 out of 8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The dose of CyA given to the 4 patients who improved after the therapy was 5 to 9 mg/kg/day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One patient needed 11 weeks until the first sign of response (increase of reticulocytes) appeared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the other three patients, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0836924" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">platelets increased</z:e> first in response to CyA within 5 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Side effects such as hypertricosis and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000212'>gingival hyperplasia</z:hpo> were frequently seen during the CyA therapy, but since they were not so severe or transient, almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients tolerated the therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that CyA can be an efficacious drug for patients with refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Long term treatment with a relatively low dose of CyA may be important for obtaining a high response rate </plain></SENT>
