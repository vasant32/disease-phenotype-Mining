<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Long-term exposure of agriculturally used organochloride and organophosphate pesticides have been shown to cause long-lasting hematotoxicity and increased incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms involved in <z:chebi fb="239" ids="25944">pesticide</z:chebi> induced hematotoxicity and the features of toxicity that may play a major role in bone marrow suppression are not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to investigate the hematological consequences of <z:chebi fb="239" ids="25944">pesticide</z:chebi> exposure in swiss <z:mp ids='MP_0001189'>albino</z:mp> mice exposed to aqueous mixture of common agriculturally used pesticides for 6 h/day, 5 days/week for 13 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After the end of last exposure, without a recovery period, the strong hematotoxic effect of <z:chebi fb="239" ids="25944">pesticide</z:chebi> was assessed in mice with long-term bone marrow explant culture (LTBMC-Ex) system and cell colony forming assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow explant culture from the <z:chebi fb="239" ids="25944">pesticide</z:chebi> exposed group of mice failed to generate a supportive stromal matrix and did not produce adequate number of hematopoietic cells and found to contain largely the adipogenic precursors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The decreased cell colony numbers in the <z:chebi fb="239" ids="25944">pesticide</z:chebi> exposed group indicated defective maturational and functional status of different marrow cell lineages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As a whole, exposure of mice to the mixture of pesticides reduced the total number of bone marrow cells (granulocytes are the major targets of <z:chebi fb="239" ids="25944">pesticide</z:chebi> toxicity), hematopoietic, and non-hematopoietic progenitor cells and most of the hematological parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Replication of primitive stem/progenitor cells in the marrow was decreased following <z:chebi fb="239" ids="25944">pesticide</z:chebi> exposure with G0/G1-phase arrest of most of the cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The progenitor cells showed decreased percentage of cells in S/G2/M-phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0006042'>increased apoptosis</z:mp> profile of the marrow progenitors (Increased CD95 expression) and primitive stem cells (High Annexin-V positivity on Sca1+ cells) with an elevated intracellular cleaved caspase-3 level on the Sca1+ bone marrow cells provided the base necessary for explaining the deranged bone marrow microenvironmental structure which was evident from scanning electron micrographs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results clearly indicate a strong, long lasting toxic effect of pesticides on the bone marrow microenvironment and different microenvironmental components which ultimately leads to the formation of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1285162" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">degenerative disease</z:e> like <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>.
