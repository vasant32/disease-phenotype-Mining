<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: to reveal the determinants of the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemias</z:hpo> (AL) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The investigation included 104 patients, including 64 with various types of AL, 31 with AA, and 9 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A group affiliation and an erythrocyte phenotype were determined from rhesus system antigens in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients and the HFE gene was studied to identify mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For control of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037061" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">siderosis</z:e>, the authors determined serum iron (SI) by a colorimetric technique, by applying the kits of the AGAT firm (Russia), serum ferritin (SF) by an immunoradiometric method, by using the kits of Immunotech (Czechia) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The volume of transfusion was estimated in the period of June 2007 to November 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There is evidence for a relationship between the higher level of SF and the number of transfusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SF was 1046.1 microg/l in patients, H63D heterozygous carriers who had received less than 10 packed red blood cell transfusions and 2856 microg/l in those who had 20 transfusions (p &lt; 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>HFE gene mutation carriage accelerates iron accumulation and is an additional risk factor for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037061" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">siderosis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In patients with transfusion chimeras and a rare phenotype in terms of rhesus antigens, packed red blood cell transfusion results in a much more increase in iron stores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The most important factor of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e> acceleration is no specific choice of packed red blood cells for patients with rare combinations of red blood cell antigens and for those with artificially induced chimeras </plain></SENT>
