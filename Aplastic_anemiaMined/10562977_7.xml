<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared the course of children transplanted with unrelated umbilical cord blood (UCB) to those transplanted with allogeneic sibling bone marrow (BM) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients with a median age of 6.3 years were transplanted for the following diseases between April 1992 and November 1997: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, Diamond-Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011974'>myelofibrosis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004818'>paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011002'>osteopetrosis</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0009563'>dyskeratosis</z:mp> congenita </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The stem cell source was BM in ten patients and UCB in three </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively examined the conditioning regimens, stem cell source and dose, days to engraftment, survival and complication rate to see whether there was a significant advantage in using one source over the other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median time to an absolute neutrophil count &gt; 500 per microL was 25 days for UCB patients and 16 days for BM patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median time to a platelet count &gt; 20,000 per microL was 55 days for UCB patients and 22 days for BM patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 100-day mortality was 66% in UCB patients and 20% in BM patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The overall mortality rates were 66% and 40%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three patients died prior to engraftment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Seven patients (54%) were still alive as of May 1999 with a median follow-up of 1574 days post-transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The patients transplanted with BM had faster engraftment and lower rates of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e>, 100-day mortality and overall mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>HLA-matched sibling BM is preferred as a source but transplantation using unrelated UCB is still an option in treating pediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> syndromes </plain></SENT>
