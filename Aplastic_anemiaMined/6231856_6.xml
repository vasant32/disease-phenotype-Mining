<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Lymphocyte subsets were enumerated in a group of 31 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Abnormal numbers of immunoregulatory T-cells were found in some patients: 26% of them showed a reversed helper/suppressor ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seven of 18 patients showed significantly decreased proliferation in response to PWM; this hyporesponsiveness was present in 75% of patients with a reversed helper/suppressor ratio and in 10% of those with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> helper/suppressor ratio (R = 0.66, P = 0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eight of 18 patients showed suppressor activity over PWM-induced allogeneic cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This suppressive activity did not correlate with T-<z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the patients with a low number of T-cells, 73% had responded to treatment, whereas of those patients with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> number of T-cells, 26% had responded (P = 0.016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results are consistent with abnormal immune response in selected patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, and suggest a possible influence of T-cells on disease process </plain></SENT>
