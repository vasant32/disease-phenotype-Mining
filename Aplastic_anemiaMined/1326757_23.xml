<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have shown that the pathogenic and host range specificity of a prototype molecular clone of FeLV-C [FeLV-Sarma-C (FSC)] colocalize to a region encoding the 3' 73 amino acids of the pol gene product and the N-terminal 241 amino acids of the envelope surface <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> named SU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we amplified, via PCR, cloned, and sequenced the SU coding sequence from three additional <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>-inducing subgroup C FeLV isolates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Chimeric viruses were constructed by replacement of fragments of FeLV-C envelope genes into the FeLV-A prototype virus 61E </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using a modified vesicular <z:hpo ids='HP_0010280'>stomatitis</z:hpo> virus-FeLV pseudotype assay, we demonstrated that the subgroup C receptor specificity for each virus was determined by changes within the N-terminal 87-92 amino acids of SU, in which most changes occurred within the 15- to 20-amino-acid first variable region (V1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Determinants for growth in guinea pig cells colocalized to this region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Despite the consistent localization of biological determinants, the only consistent features that distinguished the deduced FeLV-A and FeLV-C proteins was one lysine-to-arginine change and a structural prediction of an alpha-helix in FeLV-A proteins versus random coil in FeLV-C proteins within V1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, arginine in equilibrium with lysine substitutions were not sufficient to convert the subgroup A virus to the subgroup C phenotype or vice versa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, certain distinct structural changes within the N-terminal region of FeLV SU can result in convergent <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> phenotypes </plain></SENT>
