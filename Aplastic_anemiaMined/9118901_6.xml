<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The stromal macrophage, a target of <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> toxicity, secretes interleukin-1 (IL-1), which induces the stromal fibroblast to synthesize hematopoietic colony-stimulating factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a mouse model, <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> causes an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> marrow hypocellularity that can be prevented by the concomitant administration of IL-1 alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The ability of <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> to interfere with the production and secretion of IL-1 alpha was tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Stromal macrophages from <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi>-treated mice were capable of the transcription to the IL-1 alpha gene and the translation of the message but showed an inability to process the 34-kDa pre-IL-1 alpha precursor to the 17-kDa biologically active cytokine </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="17594">Hydroquinone</z:chebi> is oxidized by a peroxidase-mediated reaction in the stromal macrophage to p-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16509,39439">benzoquinone</z:chebi>, which interacts with the sulfhydryl (SH) groups of proteins and was shown to completely inhibit the activity of calpain, the SH-dependent protease that cleaves pre-IL-1 alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In a similar manner, HQ, via peroxidase oxidation to p-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16509,39439">benzoquinone</z:chebi>, was capable of preventing the IL-1 beta autocrine stimulation of growth of human B1 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027022" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MPD">myeloid tumor</z:e> cells by preventing the processing of pre-IL-1 beta to mature cytokine </plain></SENT>
