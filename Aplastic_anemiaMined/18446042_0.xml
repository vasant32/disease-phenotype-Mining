<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>Aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) complicated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000132'>menorrhagia</z:hpo> is treated with transfusion and hormonal therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>When <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> is life-threatening, balloon endometrial ablation can safely be used to treat <z:hpo ids='HP_0000132'>menorrhagia</z:hpo> in selected patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE: A 56-year-old postmenopausal woman was diagnosed with AA after several weeks of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000132'>menorrhagia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>She became heavily alloimmunized after extensive platelet transfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During treatment with antithymocyte globulin, vaginal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> increased and the platelet count fell to 1,000/microl on supportive measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> stopped with use of intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8389">Premarin</z:chebi>, she was examined in the operating room </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There, a clot was removed and appeared to be a uterine caste; hemostasis continued </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Transvaginal ultrasound revealed a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> endometrial contour and <z:mp ids='MP_0008258'>thin endometrium</z:mp>; endometrial histology was benign </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After she completed antithymocyte globulin and her platelet count could be maintained over 30,000/microl with matched platelets, endometrial ablation was performed without any complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Thermal balloon endometrial ablation is an effective alternative to hysterectomy for women with persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0000132'>menorrhagia</z:hpo> and AA when supportive measures fail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Prior to endometrial ablation, evaluation should ensure <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> endometrial contour and histology, and that sufficient blood products are available to maintain platelet counts above 30,000/microl during the healing process </plain></SENT>
