<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Rejection lessened when patients were given the marrow donor's peripheral blood buffy-coat cells in addition to the marrow, but this result was achieved at the price of more <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Results with second transplants suggested that CY alternating with antithymocyte globulin (ATG) was more immunosuppressive than CY alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the current study explored CY and ATG without buffy-coat cell transfusions in 39 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> given marrow transplants from HLA-identical family members (siblings in 38 cases, father in 1 case) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We hoped both to minimize the risks of graft rejection and of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD and to improve survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were 2 to 52 years of age (median, 24.5); 87% had received previous transfusions, and 41% had therapy with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressive agents</z:chebi> before transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>They were administered four daily doses of CY (total, 200 mg/kg) alternating with three doses of ATG (total, 90 mg/kg) followed by an HLA-identical marrow graft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">Methotrexate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> were administered to prevent GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two patients rejected their grafts (5%), and both were successfully retransplanted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> (grade 2 or 3) GVHD occurred in 15% and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD in 34% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The actuarial survival rate at 3 years was 92%, which compares favorably to the 72% survival rate in 39 historical patients who were matched with current patients for age and risk factors for rejection and GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CY/ATG is a well-tolerated and effective conditioning program for marrow grafting in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> that, when combined with GVHD prevention by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi>, results in excellent survival </plain></SENT>
