<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To demonstrate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of the focal sparing of iron and fat in liver tissue in patients with hepatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 48 liver MRIs performed in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005639'>hemosiderosis</z:mp> from 2007-2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We selected five (10%) of these patients based on the observation of focal signal abnormalities in the posterior aspect of segment 4, anterior to the portal vein, on in- and out-of-phase T1-weighted gradient-echo images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To further characterize this signal abnormality in segment 4, we calculated the simultaneous proton density fat fraction and R2* relaxometry using the investigational version of a quantitative chemical shift-based water-fat separation method known as IDEAL-IQ with a multiecho gradient echo sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Visual assessment and objective measurements were performed for the focal sparing of iron and fat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The diagnoses of the five patients included <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039730" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thalassemia</z:e> (n=3), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (n=1), and myelodosysplastic syndrome (n=1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The focal sparing of iron was hypointense on R2* relaxometry compared to the rest of the liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fat fraction images failed to demonstrate a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> fat distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The focal sparing of fat in the liver with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e> appeared as a reduced fat-containing area (fat fraction, 4%) in segment 4 compared to the remainder of the left lobe (fat fraction, 12%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The R2* map revealed no difference between the focal fat-sparing area and the rest of the liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Areas in which focal fat and iron sparing occurred were not visible on post-contrast and diffusion-weighted images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Focal fat and iron sparing in patients with liver <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037061" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">siderosis</z:e> can mimic a lesion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Quantitative MRI techniques can help to characterize abnormal signal changes in segment 4 of the liver in patients with hepatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e> and can eliminate the need for biopsy of pseudolesions </plain></SENT>
