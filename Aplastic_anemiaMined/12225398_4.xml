<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The pathophysiologic relationship between <z:hpo ids='HP_0100522'>thymoma</z:hpo> and its auto-immune sequelae are yet to be fully elucidated, but are thought to be as a result of the production of auto-reactive T cell clones by the thymic epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report a case in which <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> did not develop until sometime after remission from <z:hpo ids='HP_0100522'>thymoma</z:hpo> had been induced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This observation suggests that auto-reactive T cells may be produced by the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100522'>thymoma</z:hpo> but not induce clinical auto-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021053" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">immune disease</z:e> until a later time, even after eradication of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100522'>thymoma</z:hpo> has been achieved </plain></SENT>
