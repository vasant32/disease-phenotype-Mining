<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective was to estimate the incidence and to identify risk factors for AAA in Brazil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A national case-control study was conducted to investigate the risk factors for the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One hundred twenty-five cases and 129 controls were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multiple logistic regression was used in the estimation of odds ratios (OR) to control confounding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The size of Brazil made it unfeasible to estimate the incidence of AAA in the whole country, and we limited the calculation to the state of Parana </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The annual incidence of AAA in Parana was 2.4 cases/10(6) inhabitants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no positive association between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17698">chloramphenicol</z:chebi> use and AAA (OR 0.4; 95% CI: 0.1-2.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The OR of AAA associated with household pesticides that include organophosphates in their composition was 2.7 (1.0-8.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The OR for the usage of unspecified thinner and/or <z:chebi fb="15" ids="15347">acetone</z:chebi> for at least 7 days was 3.0 (1.2-7.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Cases of AAA in Brazil seem to be associated with some factors traditionally related to this disease, such as certain solvents and the incidence is similar to what has been reported from Europe </plain></SENT>
