<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These effects have led to the use of IL-3 in clinical trials for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> as well as to stimulate bone marrow recovery in patients who have received high-dose therapy and bone marrow/stem cell transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, because one study suggested that IL-3 may also stimulate the growth of follicular small cleaved cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (FSCCL) cells in vitro, it was concerning that the use of IL-3 after bone marrow transplantation in patients with FSCCL may stimulate the growth of undetectable minimal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0543478" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">residual tumor</z:e> cells resulting in early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">relapsed disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast to these observations, our own in vitro studies demonstrated that IL-3 inhibited FSCCL cells in short-term culture in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, we conducted a phase II clinical trial using single agent IL-3 for the treatment of patients with follicular low grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our clinical data did not support the hypothesis that IL-3 is a growth stimulator of FSCCL </plain></SENT>
