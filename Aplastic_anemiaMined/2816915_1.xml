<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In four subjects with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hematopoiesis, the growth of progenitors showed single-hit kinetics both before and after T-cell removal, indicating that, in the presence of colony-stimulating activity, T-cell have no effect on progenitor growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a patient with marrow <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100522'>thymoma</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004313'>hypogammaglobulinemia</z:hpo>, and an increased number of suppressor T-cells (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221027" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Good's syndrome</z:e>), the progenitor growth deviated from linearity, demonstrating the presence of cells with suppressor activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After T-cells were removed from this sample, the progenitor growth showed single-hit kinetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The suppressive action of E-rosette-positive cells with NK or cytotoxic activities was also suggested in a patient with severe combined <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immune deficiency</z:hpo> and in a patient with T gamma <z:hpo ids='HP_0100827'>lymphocytosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Poor progenitor-cell growth in three other patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> was not significantly altered by T-cell removal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, LDA of human hematopoietic progenitors is useful for evaluating cell-mediated interactions affecting hematopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This method may facilitate elucidation of mechanisms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854467" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myelosuppression</z:e> in clinical settings </plain></SENT>
