<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have compared CD10 antigen expression in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> fetal bone marrow with that of B-linage <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both quantitative indirect immunofluoresence (QIFI) and direct immunofluorescence (IF) tests with Quantum beads were used to convert median fluorescence intensity (MFI) values into numbers of antigen molecules expressed per cell (AgE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Lymphoid precursors in the fetal marrow and liver expressed 3-12.5 x 10(3) CD10 molecules/cell with an upper limit of 5 x 10(4)/cell (MaxAgE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median CD10 AgE in the different cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> B-lineage ALL were variable and ranged from undetectable to very high values (&gt; 1.8 x 10(5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 24 of the 72 cases (33%) tested with QIFI the median CD10 AgE was above the highest values seen in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> samples (&gt; 5 x 10(4)/cell) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An additional 23.6% of cases had higher median values than the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> median CD10 AgE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Next, CD10 antigen was quantitated in 78 cases during the routine multiparameter analysis of B-lineage <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> using CD10/class II/CD34 3-color IF test or CD10/TdT 2-color IF test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The aberrant overexpression was confirmed in 43.6% of ALL cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The CD10bright display suggested ALL diagnosis even when few cells were available for study, e.g., in early relapse and in ALL masquerading as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The levels of CD10 expression were maintained in relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, different CD10 levels were associated with the various chromosomal alterations: high CD10 levels (&gt; 3 x 10(4)/cell) with hyperdiploidy, low CD10 levels (1.8-4 x 10(3)/cell) with the t(1;19) and undetectable levels (&lt; 1.2 x 10(3)/cell) with the t(4;11) translocations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
