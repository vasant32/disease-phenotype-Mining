<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IPF</z:e> value in the healthy volunteers was 3.3% (1.0-10.3) and upper 95% confidential interval (95% CI) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IPF</z:e> was determined as 7.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IPF</z:e> was significantly high in the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001973'>idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi>; 17.4%, 1.2-53.2%) and recovery phase of post-chemotherapy, and significantly low in nadir phase of post-chemotherapy, and within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range in the patients with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> in complete remission (CR) and with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) </plain></SENT>
