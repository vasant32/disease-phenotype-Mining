<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The outcome of 155 adult <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) patients treated with antithymocyte globulin (ATG, Upjohn, Kalamazoo, MI) at University of California, Los Angeles from 1977 to 1988 was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The median survival of the 146 patients who did not undergo bone marrow transplantation was 5.6 years, with 49% +/- 4% surviving more than 6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The most important predictor of survival was positive response to ATG (P &lt; 0.001), which was observed in 48% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among pretreatment variables, disease severity was the best predictor of survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with moderate AA (<z:chebi fb="8" ids="35738">MAA</z:chebi>) had significantly better survival than those with severe (SAA) or very severe (VSAA) disease (P = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 6-year actuarial survival rates of the three groups were 71% +/- 9%, 48% +/- 7% and 38% +/- 7%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cox regression analysis found disease severity to be the only pretreatment variable significantly associated with survival (P = .02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patient age, sex, disease etiology, concurrent treatment with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="50113">androgens</z:chebi>, or duration of ATG therapy were not associated with differences in survival or response to ATG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Late clonal hematologic complications (ie, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo>) were observed in 5 of the 77 patients followed for more than 2 years after ATG treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, one case of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and three <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> occurred in the ATG-treated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The survival of 56 ATG-treated patients with SAA or VSAA between the ages of 16 and 43 did not differ significantly from that of 55 adult AA patients who underwent bone marrow transplant (BMT) during the same time period (P = 0.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, 6-year survival rates improved from 43% for patients transplanted before 1984, to 72% for those who underwent BMT between 1984 and 1989 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In contrast, there was no difference in the survival rates of patients treated with ATG during these two time periods (46% v 45%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The results suggest a superior long-term outcome for adult patients with SAA treated with BMT rather than with ATG alone, using current protocols </plain></SENT>
