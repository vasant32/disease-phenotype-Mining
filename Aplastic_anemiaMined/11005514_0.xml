<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> are now living longer and therefore are at increased risk for the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010885'>osteonecrosis</z:hpo> of the hip </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, studies on the results of arthroplasty for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002758'>osteoarthritis</z:hpo> of the hip in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> are lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-six primary hip prostheses (one bipolar prosthesis fixed with cement, two bipolar prostheses fixed without cement, three hybrid total hip prostheses, and twenty total hip prostheses fixed without cement) were implanted, between March 1990 and May 1992, in nineteen patients who had been diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A specific prospective protocol was followed for the perioperative transfusion of platelets and blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five hips were replaced because of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010885'>osteonecrosis</z:hpo> of the femoral head, and one was replaced because of a femoral neck fracture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patients were followed prospectively, with preoperative and serial postoperative Harris hip ratings as well as radiographs, for a minimum of six years or until <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No patient had excessive perioperative <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> or a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0392618" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">postoperative infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After a mean duration of follow-up of seventy-nine months (range, seventy-two to ninety-five months), two patients had died with the original implant in place </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No patients were lost to follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean Harris hip score was 55 points (range, 42 to 68 points) preoperatively and 87 points (range, 56 to 95 points) at the time of the latest follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At the time of this writing, no hip had been revised </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One patient with a bipolar prosthesis had radiographic evidence of femoral loosening and will probably require revision </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A second patient had some medial protrusion of a bipolar prosthesis, with mild symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the acetabular components that had been fixed without cement and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the other femoral components appeared to be stable on radiographs after a minimum of seventy-two months of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Total hip arthroplasty can be performed safely in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In the present intermediate-term study, the durability of implant fixation was maintained and the clinical results demonstrated a sustained increase in function of the hip </plain></SENT>
