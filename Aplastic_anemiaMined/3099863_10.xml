<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A radioimmunoassay (RIA) was used to quantitate biologically active gamma interferon (INF-gamma) in sera and in supernatants of cultured mononuclear cells obtained from 50 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Only five of the 50 serum samples had INF-gamma levels above background (greater than 0 less than 0.5 units per mL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Detectable levels of spontaneous INF-gamma (0.3 to 868 U/mL) were found in 18 of the 50 mononuclear cell supernatants tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The addition of patient sera or INF-gamma positive supernatants to cultures of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hematopoietic colonies did not result in reduced colony growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Flow cytofluorimetric analysis of mononuclear cells failed to establish a correlation between the presence of INF-gamma in supernatants and the number of activated T cells or natural killer (NK) cells in the mononuclear cell population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, a significant correlation did exist between the presence of monocytes and the production of INF-gamma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Contrary to previous reports, our data suggest that patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> do not have high circulating levels of INF-gamma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Unstimulated mononuclear cells from some patients will produce significant levels of INF-gamma, but this does not result in decreased in vitro hematopoiesis </plain></SENT>
