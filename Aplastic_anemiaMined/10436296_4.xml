<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In a prospective long-term study on the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004818'>paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>), 115 consecutive patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (SAA), 97 treated with antilymphocyte globulin (ALG) and 18 with bone marrow transplantation (BMT), were observed over a period of 4-18 years and tested for the presence of complement-sensitive hematopoietic precursor cells with the bone marrow (BM) <z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi> test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sixteen (14%) of the ALG-treated patients developed clinical signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> between 0.5 and 8 years after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Complement-sensitive BM precursors were found in 89% of the SAA patients at some time during their disease, but in none of 18 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At diagnosis, their proportion was significantly higher in patients who later developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> than in patients who later achieved disease-free complete remission (CR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After ALG, the abnormal population was found in both groups, but it was gradually replaced by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> precursors in remission patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After BMT, the complement-sensitive population decreased to very low numbers in patients with a stable graft, but increased again in 3 patients upon graft rejection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mimicking the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> defect by enzymatic removal of glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked proteins from CD34+ cells resulted in their complement sensitivity, suggesting that the BM <z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi> test identifies precursor cells carrying the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> defect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 66 patients, white blood cells (WBC) in peripheral blood (PB) were examined for GPI-deficient populations by flow cytometry (FACS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ten patients with signs of clinical or laboratory <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> had over 25% complement-sensitive precursor cells in the BM and a GPI-deficient WBC population in the PB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of 56 SAA patients without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>, 8 had an abnormal population detectable with both tests, 26 only with the BM <z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi> test, 4 only with PB FACS analysis, and in 18, no abnormal cells were detected with either test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In search for parameters which might explain why in some patients the abnormal population expands, while it regresses or disappears in others, we tested the release of IL-2 as a parameter of immune competence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>At diagnosis, IL-2 release was approximately 50% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in patients who later developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>, while it was double the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> value in patients who later achieved CR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the majority of SAA patients transiently harbor complement-sensitive precursor cells in the BM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Patients with more than 25% abnormal BM precursors and low endogenous IL-2 release are at risk of progression to clinical <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
