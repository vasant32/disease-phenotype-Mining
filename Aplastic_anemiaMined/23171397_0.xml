<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A possible means of accelerating hematopoietic reconstitution would be administration of cells capable of secreting hematopoietic growth factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Advantages of this approach would include: a) ability to regulate secretion of cytokines based on biological need; b) long term, localized production of growth factors, alleviating need for systemic administration of factors that possess unintended adverse effects; and c) potential to actively repair the hematopoietic stem cell niche </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we overview the field of hematopoietic growth factors, discuss previous experiences with mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) in accelerating hematopoiesis, and conclude by putting forth the rationale of utilizing exogenous endothelial cells as a novel cellular therapy for acceleration of hematopoietic recovery </plain></SENT>
