<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Pure red cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> and moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> are marrow failure states with an immune pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previously, we described short-term improvements in blood counts in two pilot studies treating moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (mAA) and pure red cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> (PRCA) patients with daclizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody to the interleukin-2 receptor; we now report our long-term experience with a larger cohort of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: After a median follow-up period of 4.8 years, 19 of 45 (42%) evaluable mAA patients and 10 of 26 (38%) patients with PRCA responded by three months and 2 additional mAA patients responded by six months following administration of the drug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seven of 28 (25%) mAA patients achieved long-term packed red blood cell PRBC transfusion independence, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> PRCA responders achieved long-term transfusion PRBC transfusion independence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Red cell transfusion-independence prior to treatment in mAA patients predicted response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The only significant adverse treatment-related events were transient <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015230" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rashes</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002829'>arthralgias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Daclizumab is safe and effective, and produces lengthy remissions in patients with PRCA and mAA </plain></SENT>
