<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this case series we report 2 cases of patients who present with AA occurring simultaneously with the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006554'>acute liver failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This is among only a few reported cases known to date in which AA occurs simultaneously with impending <z:hpo ids='HP_0001399'>liver failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>More importantly, this is the first report that demonstrates the feasibility of administering immunosuppressive therapy before complete resolution of the hepatic dysfunction and with excellent results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both of our cases avoided orthotopic liver transplantation through the use of timely immunosuppressive therapy, demonstrating the potential role of medical management to avoid transplantation in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have suggested a link between an unidentified <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> process and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002958'>immune dysregulation</z:hpo> that may lead to the development of AA after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These 2 cases support the rationale that in our patients the 2 disease processes may share a common etiology and encourage further research into the complex pathogenic mechanism affecting these 2 different organ systems at varying points in time </plain></SENT>
