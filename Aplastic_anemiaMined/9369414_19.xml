<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Agnogenic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_173'>myeloid metaplasia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMM</z:e>) is a disease characterized by bone marrow megakaryocyte <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> and clusters of megakaryocytes, in which many of the megakaryocytes are atypical </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to elucidate the mechanisms of megakaryocytosis, ELISA assays of blood levels of thrombopoietin (TPO), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-11 (IL-11) were done in 45 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMM</z:e> and compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteer controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Higher blood TPO levels were found in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMM</z:e> than in controls (P &lt; 0.0001), and blood TPO levels were correlated with the degree of marrow <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> (P = 0.0078) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Blood levels of IL-6 were also significantly higher in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMM</z:e>, when compared with controls (P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, no correlation was found between blood IL-6 levels and degree of marrow <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No correlation was found between either TPO or IL-6 and the number of blood platelet counts, the number of marrow megakaryocytes, WBC counts, or the degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001744'>splenomegaly</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Blood IL-11 levels were undetectable in most patients and no significant difference was found in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMM</z:e> as compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The present study demonstrated that, while in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001973'>idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi>) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, blood TPO levels are relatively correlated with the numbers of platelet and/or megakaryocyte mass, blood TPO levels do not correlate with blood platelet counts, or marrow megakaryocyte mass in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMM</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AMM</z:e>, other mechanisms such as the number of TPO receptors on platelets or megakaryocytes, c-MPL receptor abnormalities, abnormal production of TPO <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and so on, will have to be studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, TPO may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of marrow <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp>; IL-6 may be a factor in the development of marrow megakaryocytosis but its elevated blood levels may represent a secondary immune phenomenon; and IL-11 probably does not play a significant role in causing marrow megakaryocytosis in this disease </plain></SENT>
