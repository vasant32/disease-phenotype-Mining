<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It was shown that the T subsets of patients with CAA have remarkable changes: Ts (41.3 +/- 11.2%) increased more than the control (22.9 +/- 4.5%), Th/Ts decreased significantly more than the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control (0.98 +/- 0.38 to 1.59 +/- 0.38) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>From the group of deficiency of both vital energy and blood to the group of deficiency of Kidney-yang to the group of deficiency of Kidney-Yin to the group of deficiency of both Kidney-Yang and Kidney-Yin, the Th lymphocyte gradually decreased, Ts lymphocyte successfully increased (from 33.8 +/- 7.9% to 57.7 +/- 7.5%), Th/Ts ratio declined (from 1.29 +/- 0.36 to 0.57 +/- 0.19) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Th/Ts ratio of the latter two groups decreased more than the former two groups (P less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results indicated that the T lymphocyte subsets and symptom complex group of patients with CAA were closely related and when deficient Yang affects Yin the immunologic function of body has a more obvious change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This revealed the connotation of Kidney-Yin and Kidney-Yang on the immuno-regulating cells (T lymphocyte subsets) level </plain></SENT>
