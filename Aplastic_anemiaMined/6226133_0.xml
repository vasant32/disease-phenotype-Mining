<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It was found that pretreatment of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphocytes with the immunoglobulin fraction of the patient's serum resulted in marked inhibition of their proliferative response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogens</z:chebi>, as well as their ability to serve as stimulators and responders in MLC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patient's lymphocytes, unlike those of her HLA-identical sister were unable to stimulate and respond in MLC and markedly suppressed mixed lymphocyte reactivity between two unrelated healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Donor-type lymphocytes obtained from the patient after engraftment were also unable to respond or stimulate in MLC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that the suppression of lymphocyte responses was mediated by an immunoglobulin present in the patient's serum </plain></SENT>
