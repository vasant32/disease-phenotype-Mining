<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition to their use in documenting bone marrow engraftment following transplantation, they have been used to (1) evaluate whether recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> occurs in donor or recipient cells and whether recovery in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> results from growth of host or donor cells, (2) demonstrate the bone marrow origin of pulmonary macrophages and hepatic Kupffer cells, (3) show that bone marrow fibroblasts have an origin different from that of the hematopoietic bone marrow cells, (4) evaluate twin zygosity in preparation for transplantation, and (5) show that the defect in Fanconi's <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> is intracellular </plain></SENT>
