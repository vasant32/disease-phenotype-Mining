<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For the most part these clinical cases are difficult to evaluate but appear to rely heavily for support on a single report in 1935 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The infrequency of these reports and the wide-spread use of hair color products argue strongly against a primary toxic action on bone marrow in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results of studies in three species of animals support this conclusion, giving no indication that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> exposure to hair dyes causes adverse effects on hematopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although it cannot be dismissed as a possibility, invoking idiosyncrasy seems on equally shaky grounds since any rational basis for continued association of a substance with individual sensitivity should find increasing numbers of cases with increasing population exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clearly this has not been the case </plain></SENT>
