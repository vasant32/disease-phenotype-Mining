<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>WB-MRI was performed on five patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> who ranged in age from 62 to 70 years of age, and on four controls with malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> who ranged in age from 59 to 67 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Coronal images were obtained using a body coil with an FOV of 48 cm x 48 cm, and with both fast short T1 inversion recovery(STIR) and spin-echo T1-weighted(T1-WI) in three regions: (1) head to thorax, (2) abdomen to pelvis, and (3) lower extremities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The findings on WB-MRI were compared with those of histological studies of bone marrow at the sternum and the posterior iliac crest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results were as follows: (1) there was a correlation between the cellularity of histological studies of bone marrow and signal intensity on WB-MRI; (2) WB-MRI could detect the activity of bone marrow; and (3) in a comparison of signal intensity in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and control subjects, there were differences of signal intensity in the central marrow </plain></SENT>
