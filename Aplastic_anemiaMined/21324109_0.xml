<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During pregnancy it could be life-threatening for both mother and child </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The only causal therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> is bone marrow transplantation, which is contraindicated during pregnancy because of potential embryo toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Treatment options are erythrocytes and platelet transfusions and immunosuppressive therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There is, however, no agreement about the optimal supportive care and treatment regime for this disorder during pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CASE PRESENTATION: A 26-year-old nulliparous Asian woman with an uneventful medical history was admitted to the hospital at 14 weeks' gestation because of excessive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Routine laboratory tests showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> (Hb 3.5 mmol/L, leukocytes 3.5 *109/L, platelets 45 *109L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A bone marrow biopsy confirmed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">Methylprednisolon</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> A, packed cells and platelet transfusions were initiated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At 33 weeks she developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> (0.1 *109/L) for which oral colistin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28864">tobramycin</z:chebi> were given prophylactically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At 35 weeks labor was induced, during which she developed a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> of 38.2Â°C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>She gave birth spontaneously to a healthy son weighing 2415 grams, who had no signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>After delivery the blood count of the patient did not recover and did not respond to medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Eighteen weeks after delivery she died of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> complicated by cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> and infarction due to severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo>, despite optimal supportive treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This potential life-threatening disease has a relatively good prognosis for both mother and child after optimal treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Transfusion during pregnancy is the first choice treatment with recommended <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> levels of &gt;5.5 mmol/L and platelet counts of &gt;20 *109/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">Cyclosporine</z:chebi> A seems a reasonable alternative therapy with a reported success rate in non-pregnant patients of 70% when combined with antithymocyte globuline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Our patient died 18 weeks postpartum from cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> and infarction due to severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> despite intensive supportive treatment, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolon</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> A </plain></SENT>
