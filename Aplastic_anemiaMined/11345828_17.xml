<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The percentage of RPs and GC index (plasma GC level normalized for the individual platelet count) were markedly elevated in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001973'>idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi>) but <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or slightly elevated in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) or chemotherapy-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> (ChemoT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For RP percentage for diagnosing hyperdestructive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> the sensitivity and specificity were excellent but were lower for the GC index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Absolute RP counts and plasma GC levels were markedly decreased and plasma TPO levels markedly elevated in patients with AA or ChemoT, but absolute RP counts and plasma GC levels were moderately decreased and plasma TPO levels only slightly elevated in patients with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity and specificity of plasma TPO levels for diagnosing hypoplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> were excellent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using the RP percentage and plasma TPO levels in combination improved specificities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Simultaneous measurement of RP percentage and plasma TPO level may help discriminate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> of unknown cause in routine hematologic practice </plain></SENT>
