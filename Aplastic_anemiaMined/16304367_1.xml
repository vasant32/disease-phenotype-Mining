<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The primary therapeutic approach to acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) in older adults differs from the primary approach used in children and younger adults because in the former group, the results of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) are less favorable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>With increasing age of the patients, immunosuppressive therapy with antithymocyte globulin (ATG) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> (CsA) constitutes the primary treatment option and may be better than BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There are very few clinical clues as to the selection of patients likely to respond to immunosuppression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Repeated ATG/CsA cycles are often used as salvage regimens, but in refractory patients BMT may be the best treatment option, as the prognosis for non-responders is poor without definitive treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Conservative therapy such as intense immunosuppression is associated with a high relapse rate but does not impact the survival and overall prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The inability to eliminate autoimmune T cell clones using current therapeutic strategies suggests that prolonged immunosuppressive maintenance therapy may be needed for a substantial proportion of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Late clonal complications of conservatively treated patients include evolution to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004818'>paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</z:hpo> and may develop in 20% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, BMT also has several sequelae including an increased frequency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Novel immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory agents and constantly improving results of allogeneic BMT will further improve the survival rate of adult patients with AA </plain></SENT>
