<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The study was aimed to explore the effects of T-bet (T-box expressed in T cell), GATA-3(GATA binding protein 3) and relevant signal transduction pathways on the immune-related pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (CAA), and to investigate the immunological regulation mechanism in the treatment of CAA by using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> A (CsA) at the level of Th cell imbalance, transcriptional factors, and relevant signal pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The real-time fluorescent quantitative polymerase chain reaction (real-time FQ-PCR) was used to determine the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of T-bet, GATA-3, signal transducers and activators of transcription 4 (STAT4) and signal transducers and activators of transcription 6 (STAT6) in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMNC) of CAA patients before and after treatment with CsA; the flow cytometry (FCM) and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were used to determine the Th1/Th2 proportion in peripheral blood, and levels of IFN-γ, IL-12 and IL-4 in PBMNC-cultured supernatant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Healthy people were included to test the above indexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of PBMNC T-bet, STAT4, T-bet/GATA-3 ratio, Th1 proportion, Th1/Th2 ratio and levels of IFN-γ and IL-12 in PBMNC-cultured supernatant of CAA patients were significantly higher than those of healthy people (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After treating with CsA for 6 months of CsA treatment, expression of T-bet, STAT4, T-bet/GATA-3 ratio, Th1 proportion, IFN-γ and IL-12 levels were lower than before, however, the expression of T-bet, STAT4, T-bet/GATA-3 ratio, Th1 proportion and IFN-γ had not been reduced to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared to healthy people, no significant difference existed in the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of GATA-3, STAT6, Th2 proportion, as well as level of IL-4 before and after treatment (p&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the abnormal activation of IFN-γ/T-bet and IL-12/STAT4 pathways, as well as Th balance deviating to Th1 excursion play vital roles in the immunological pathogenesis of AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CsA lowers the abnormal activation of IFN-γ/T-bet and IL-12/STAT4 pathways to correct Th1 hyperpolarization, which may reduce the abnormally activated cell-mediated immunity and relax hematopoietic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> of AA patients </plain></SENT>
