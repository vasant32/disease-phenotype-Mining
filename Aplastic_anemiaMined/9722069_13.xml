<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Age at transplant ranged from 6 to 54 years (mean 25.6 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Diagnoses included <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo>, non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> and other diagnoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Effects of patient characteristics on risk of gonadal dysfunction were analyzed by comparing the cumulative probability of developing gonadal dysfunction over time from BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ninety-two percent of the males and 99% of the females developed evidence of gonadal dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Females were not only more likely to develop elevated gonadotrophin levels than males, but did so earlier after BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Odds ratios were calculated to determine potentially important prognostic factors for the development of an elevated gonadotrophin level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Older age at BMT was correlated with an increased risk in the development of elevated gonadotrophin levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Individuals who received radiation were more likely to develop an elevated FSH level over time than those who had received no preparative radiation treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Males were more likely to experience gonadal recovery than females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In those cases that did recover, males tended to recover more quickly after BMT than females </plain></SENT>
