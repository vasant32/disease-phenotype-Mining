<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Bone marrow transplant (BMT) patients, although immunosuppressed, are at risk for the development of red cell (RBC) and HLA antibodies, and they often are given filtered blood in an effort to prevent the latter complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study attempts to determine the rate of formation and the specificity of both RBC and HLA alloantibodies in this patient population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: BMT patients (148 received autologous marrow; 45 received allogeneic marrow) from an 18-month period, including patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (57 patients), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (54), <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> (68), <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> (8), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (5), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (1), were studied to determine the rate of alloantibody formation to RBC and HLA antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 2,410 RBC antibody screens were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients received 3,921 packed RBCs and 5,915 single-donor platelet units; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> were irradiated and administered via white cell-reduction filters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seven (3.6%) of 193 patients had RBC antibodies upon hospital admission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four (2.1%) of 193 developed RBC antibodies during the course of BMT: 3 patients had one RBC antibody and 1 patient had two RBC antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RBC antibodies included anti-E (n = 2), anti-M (n = 1), anti-Jkb (n = 1), and anti-Lu14 (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, 98 percent of patients (189/193) did not develop new (182/186) or additional (7/7) RBC antibodies during BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>BMT patients were also screened weekly for HLA antibody formation (60-cell panel) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Upon admission, 170 (85%) patients were negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Of these, 8 (4.7%) developed persistent HLA antibodies (mean panel-reactive antibody score, 33 +/- 29%) and 9 (5.3%) were variably positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Thus, in our setting and population, RBC antibody formation was 0.1 percent per unit transfused, and the HLA <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948201" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">alloimmunization</z:e> rate was 5 to 10 percent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: As RBC antibody screens are done every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday on this BMT service and as RBC antibody formation is low in these patients, screening for unexpected antibodies might be possible on a more infrequent basis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Also, the rate of HLA <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948201" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">alloimmunization</z:e> in this population receiving filtered blood components is low </plain></SENT>
