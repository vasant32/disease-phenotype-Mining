<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Nine isolates of Escherichia coli were recovered from seven blood cultures over a period of 3 months from a 19-month-old female with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Initial isolates were susceptible to extended-spectrum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23066">cephalosporins</z:chebi>, including <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3508">ceftazidime</z:chebi> (MIC, &lt; or = 0.25 microgram/ml), but gradually became resistant to this drug (MICs, &gt; or = 128 micrograms/ml) and other <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23066">cephalosporins</z:chebi> and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50695">monobactam</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2960">aztreonam</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Molecular typing methods, including plasmid profile analysis, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, and arbitrarily primed PCR, indicated that the nine isolates were derived from a common ancestor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Dot blot hybridization and PCR analysis of total <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> DNA using blaSHV- and blaTEM-specific DNA probes and primers identified the presence of a blaTEM beta-lactamase gene in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the isolates and a blaSHV gene in the isolates with elevated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3508">ceftazidime</z:chebi> MICs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Isoelectric focusing analysis of crude lysates showed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> nine isolates contained an enzyme with a pI of 5.4 corresponding to the TEM-1 beta-lactamase, and those isolates containing an SHV-type beta-lactamase demonstrated an additional band with a pI of 7.6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The first of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3508">ceftazidime</z:chebi>-resistant isolates appeared to hyperproduce the SHV enzyme compared to the other resistant isolates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>DNA sequencing revealed a blaSHV-1 gene in the first <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3508">ceftazidime</z:chebi>-resistant isolate and a novel blaSHV gene, blaSHV-8, with an Asp-to<z:chebi fb="1" ids="32654">-Asn</z:chebi> substitution at amino acid position 179 in the remaining four isolates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3508">ceftazidime</z:chebi>-resistant isolates also showed a change in porin profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The patient had received multiple courses of antimicrobial agents during her illness, including multiple courses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3508">ceftazidime</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This collection of blood isolates from the same patient appears to represent the in vivo evolution of resistance under selective pressure of treatment with various <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23066">cephalosporins</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
