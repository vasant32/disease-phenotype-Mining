<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Such effects include the collapse of the profits of the British indigo monopoly, the growth in economic power of Germany based on coal tar chemistry, and an economic crisis in India that led to more humane tax laws and, ultimately, the independence of India and the end of the British Empire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Additional consequences were the development of antiseptic surgery and the synthesis of a wide variety of useful drugs that have eradicated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> and alleviated pain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Many of these drugs, particularly the commonly used <z:chebi fb="29" ids="35480">analgesics</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35358">sulfonamides</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35850">sulfones</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36333">local anesthetics</z:chebi>, are derivatives of <z:chebi fb="6" ids="17296">aniline</z:chebi>, originally called "blue oil" or "<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17296">kyanol</z:chebi>." Some of these <z:chebi fb="6" ids="17296">aniline</z:chebi> derivatives, however, have also caused <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0000334'>agranulocytosis</z:mp>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0012119'>methemoglobinemia</z:hpo> (that is, "blue people") </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Exposure to <z:chebi fb="6" ids="17296">aniline</z:chebi> drugs, particularly when two or three <z:chebi fb="6" ids="17296">aniline</z:chebi> drugs are taken concurrently, seems to be the commonest cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0012119'>methemoglobinemia</z:hpo> today </plain></SENT>
