<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To explore the relationship between the hematopoietic inhibitor and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of CD34+ cells in patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (SAA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The inhibiting activity to the growth of both BFU-E and CFU-GM was analysed by in vitro <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53448">methylcellulose</z:chebi> culture and CD34+ cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was assayed with a kit of programmed cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> assay and flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sera from two SAA patients suppressed the growth of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hematopoietic progenitor cells and induced CD34+ cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum immunoglobulin fraction assay showed that the inhibiting activity was in the IgG fraction which bound specifically to CD34+ cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There was an inhibitive IgG fraction, which induced CD34+ cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, in the serum of SAA patients and CD34+ cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> might be a part of the pathogenesis of SAA </plain></SENT>
