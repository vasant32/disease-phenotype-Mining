<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The case of a 33-year-old man with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> who experienced recurrent episodes of hypoxemia and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002113'>pulmonary infiltrates</z:hpo> during infusions of antithymocyte globulin (ATG) is described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>With the use of high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi>, the patient's original episodes resolved, and were subsequently prevented before additional administrations of ATG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rare reports of an association between ATG and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lung injury are found in the literature, but this is the first report of successful steroid-supported re-exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although the mechanism of ATG-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lung injury remains uncertain, it may be parallel to the mechanism of transfusion-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lung injury because the pathogenesis of the latter relies, in part, on antileukocyte antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ATG-related toxicity should be included in the differential diagnosis of new, infusion-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002113'>pulmonary infiltrates</z:hpo>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> may be a useful therapeutic consideration in the management </plain></SENT>
