<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sca-1 is the "stem cell antigen" marker used to identify the primitive murine <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSC</z:chebi> population, the expression of which decreases upon differentiation to other mature cell types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sca-1(+) <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSCs</z:chebi> maintain the bone marrow stem cell pool throughout the life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>Aplastic anemia</z:hpo> is a disease considered to involve primary stem cell deficiency and is characterized by severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> and a decline in healthy blood cell generation system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Studies conducted in our laboratory revealed that the primitive Sca-1(+) BM-<z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSCs</z:chebi> (bone marrow hematopoietic stem cell) are significantly affected in experimental Aplastic animals pretreated with chemotherapeutic drugs (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">Busulfan</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">Cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>) and there is increased Caspase-3 activity with consecutive high Annexin-V positivity leading to premature <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in the bone marrow hematopoietic stem cell population in Aplastic condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Sca-1(bright), that is, "more primitive" BM-<z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSC</z:chebi> population was more affected than the "less primitive" BM-<z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSC</z:chebi> Sca-1(dimâ€‰) population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The decreased cell population and the receptor expression were directly associated with an empty and deranged marrow microenvironment, which is evident from scanning electron microscopy (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The above experimental evidences hint toward the manipulation of receptor expression for the benefit of cytotherapy by primitive stem cell population in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>Aplastic anemia</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
