<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirty of these patients also received an infusion of HLA-haploidentical marrow cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Only those patients having evidence of hematologic recovery within 3 mo after ATG therapy were considered responders to the immunosuppressive regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of 53 patients evaluable for response, 21 had complete or partial responses and 7 had minimal improvement by defined criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The remaining patients did not respond or died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Factors correlated with response to therapy included a short duration of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> and a high admission granulocyte count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirty-six patients (66.7%) are surviving between 18 and 43 mo, and 18 have died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>Deaths</z:hpo> were due to <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> and/or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Short duration of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> and high granulocyte counts also correlated with survival, as did younger age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Four patients with complete or partial responses had a recurrence of severe <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> 6-17 mo after their first course of ATG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Three of these patients were retreated with ATG (and oxymetholone in two cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three had second responses to therapy, but two of the three have had second relapses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The fourth patient responded to oxymetholone alone, but died after a second relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Mismatched marrow infusion had no effect on the incidence of response or survival </plain></SENT>
