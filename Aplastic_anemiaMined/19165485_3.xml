<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In most cases, T cell-mediated immune destruction of hematopoietic cells results in peripheral blood <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow hypoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A subset of the heterodimeric interleukin-23 receptor gene (IL-23R) is significantly associated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_346'>autoimmune-mediated diseases</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To examine whether IL-23R single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) might contribute to AA, we selected three IL-23R SNPs with amino acid changes (rs11209026: p.Arg381Gln; rs41313262: p.Val362Ile; and rs11465797: p.Thr175Asn) and compared their frequencies in 279 AA patients and 184 ethnically matched healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The three SNP prevalences were similar between the AA patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Arg381Gln variant, which has a strong protective effect against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inflammatory bowel disease</z:e>, showed no association with AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, IL-23 levels in sera were measured in the AA patients and in controls, and there were no significant differences among them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that these three IL-23R SNPs and serum IL-23 level have no apparent impact on susceptibility to AA </plain></SENT>
