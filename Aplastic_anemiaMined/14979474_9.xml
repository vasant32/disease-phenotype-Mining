<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The annual incidence was 4.02 cases per million births, the median age at diagnosis was 60 days, and 59% of the cases presented by 3 months of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three patients had a familial occurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> (PSL), and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> (CsA) was added to the therapy in 17 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Forty-seven patients received transfusions, and 13 underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cumulative probabilities of a medication-free or a transfusion-free state prior to HSCT were 36% and 69%, respectively, at more than 5 years after diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients were weaned from PSL therapy without HSCT, and CsA was not associated with weaning from therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Transfusion and medication were stopped at 249 days and 933 days after diagnosis in 34 and 13 patients, respectively, who achieved a state of independence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No initial findings predicted the treatment dependence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>More than 20% of patients experienced sustained <z:mp ids='MP_0005639'>hemosiderosis</z:mp> and/or adverse effects of PSL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The ages and reticulocyte counts at diagnosis of the patients who underwent HSCT were lower than in the patients who did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>HSCT led to the highest success (85%) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> previous reports, even though 5 alternative donors were included in our study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Two cord blood transplants from unrelated donors failed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest the need for developing an integral treatment strategy including selective HSCT for refractory <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
