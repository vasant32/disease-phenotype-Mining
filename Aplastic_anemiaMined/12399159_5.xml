<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It was proposed that a bioactivation of FBM leading to formation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51718">alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehyde</z:chebi>, atropaldehyde (ATPAL) could be responsible for toxicities associated with the parent drug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Other members of this class of compounds, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="15368">acrolein</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32585">4-hydroxynonenal</z:chebi> (HNE), are known for their reactivity and toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It has been proposed that the bioactivation of FBM to ATPAL proceeds though a more stable cyclized product, 4-hydroxy-5-phenyltetrahydro-1,3-oxazin-2-one (CCMF) whose formation has been shown recently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="17478">Aldehyde</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (ALDH) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> transferase (GST) are detoxifying enzymes and targets for reactive <z:chebi fb="5" ids="17478">aldehydes</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This study examined effects of ATPAL and its precursor, CCMF on ALDH, GST and cell viability in liver, the target tissue for its metabolism and toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A known toxin, HNE, which is also a substrate for ALDH and GST, was used for comparison </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interspecies difference in metabolism of FBM is well documented, therefore, human tissue was deemed most relevant and used for these studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ATPAL inhibited ALDH and GST activities and led to a loss of hepatocyte viability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Several fold greater concentrations of CCMF were necessary to demonstrate a similar degree of ALDH inhibition or cytotoxicity as observed with ATPAL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This is consistent with CCMF requiring prior conversion to the more proximate toxin, ATPAL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>GSH was shown to protect against ALDH inhibition by ATPAL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In this context, ALDH and GST are detoxifying pathways and their inhibition would lead to an accumulation of reactive species from FBM metabolism and/or metabolism of other endogenous or exogenous compounds and predisposing to or causing toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Therefore, mechanisms of reactive <z:chebi fb="5" ids="17478">aldehydes</z:chebi> toxicity could include direct interaction with critical cellular macromolecules or indirect interference with cellular detoxification mechanisms </plain></SENT>
