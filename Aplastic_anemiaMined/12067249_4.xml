<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These toxicities are believed to be mediated by the formation of the reactive species 2-phenylpropenal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>4-Hydroxy-5-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="30396">phenyl</z:chebi>-[1,3]oxazinan-2-one is a metabolic precursor for 2-phenylpropenal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>4-Hydroxy-5-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="30396">phenyl</z:chebi>-[1,3]oxazinan-2-one exists in equilibrium with 3-oxo-2-phenylpropyl <z:chebi fb="1" ids="13941">carbamate</z:chebi>, which can undergo beta-elimination to form 2-phenylpropenal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The work presented here investigates the interaction between 4-hydroxy-5-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="30396">phenyl</z:chebi>-[1,3]oxazinan-2-one and human serum albumin (HSA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HSA (40 mg/mL) was found to decrease the half-life of 4-hydroxy-5-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="30396">phenyl</z:chebi>-[1,3]oxazinan-2-one from 4.57 +/- 0.44 h to 1.07 +/- 0.10 h at pH 7.4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This decrease in the half-life of 4-hydroxy-5-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="30396">phenyl</z:chebi>-[1,3]oxazinan-2-one was due to increased beta-elimination of 3-oxo-2-phenylpropyl <z:chebi fb="1" ids="13941">carbamate</z:chebi>, presumably through HSA-mediated general base catalysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The k(cat) for HSA-catalyzed decomposition of 4-hydroxy-5-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="30396">phenyl</z:chebi>-[1,3]oxazinan-2-one was determined to be 12.04 min(-)(1) M(-)(1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Competitive binding assays using <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="5855">ibuprofen</z:chebi> showed that HSA-catalyzed decomposition of 4-hydroxy-5-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="30396">phenyl</z:chebi>-[1,3]oxazinan-2-one is dependent on the subdomain IIA binding site of HSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>LC/MS/MS analyses of trypsin digests of HSA incubations with either 4-hydroxy-5-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="30396">phenyl</z:chebi>-[1,3]oxazinan-2-one or 2-phenylpropenal identified HSA-2-phenylpropenal adducts formed specifically at residues His-242 and His-247 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These HSA-2-phenylpropenal adducts were found to be slowly reversible, with a decrease in alkylation of 74.0 +/- 0.6% after extensive dialysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, only the bis-adduct (His-242 and His-247) could be identified after dialysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate the first direct example of 2-phenylpropenal conjugation to a human protein in vitro and suggest the possibility that HSA may be involved in the development of felbamate toxicity either by antigen formation or as a route of detoxification of 2-phenylpropenal </plain></SENT>
