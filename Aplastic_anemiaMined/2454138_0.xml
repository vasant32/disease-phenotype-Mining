<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The gamma chain composition of 17 patients with varying degrees of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> was determined by high performance liquid chromatography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 10 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> had high G gamma levels (48.1-68.5%), while 5/7 patients in remission had G gamma in the range 30.0-38.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was also an association of higher G gamma values with higher HbF levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The average value of G gamma in the HbF of patients with active aplastic or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001908'>hypoplastic anemia</z:hpo> differed from those obtained both for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> adult and for newborn HbF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, in spite of activation of both the G gamma and A gamma genes, the former are more effectively expressed as HbF increases </plain></SENT>
