<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The hematopoietic growth factors stem cell factor (SCF) and flt3 ligand (flt3L) are produced within the hematopoietic microenvironment in a membrane-bound and soluble isoform </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To elucidate the relevance of the two isoforms in the network of early-acting cytokines, we examined the interaction of membrane-bound SCF with the soluble forms of SCF and flt3L in long-term cultures of human bone marrow cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Feeder layers of the murine SCF-deficient Steel stromal cell line transfected with human cDNA stably expressing SCF as a transmembrane molecule were used to support growth of mononuclear cells and CD34+ progenitors derived from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human bone marrow or from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151773" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoplastic marrow</z:e> of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The output of nonadherent progenitor cells representing colony-forming units (CFU) and high-proliferative potential colony-forming cells (HPP-CFC) was scored weekly in secondary <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53448">methylcellulose</z:chebi> cultures; the number of colonies derived from long-term culture-initiating cells (LTC-IC) was determined in nonadherent and adherent cells at 5 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Membrane-bound SCF expressed in the stromal layer was more effective than soluble SCF and soluble flt3L in maintaining clonogenic progenitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the transmembrane form of SCF effectively synergized with both exogenously supplied factors, although the effect of flt3L was superior to the effect of soluble SCF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In cultures of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow cells, addition of flt3L enhanced the total number of CFU and HPP-CFC-type progenitors, primarily of the granulocyte/macrophage lineage, by six- to ninefold after 3 weeks and of LTC-IC-derived colonies by 13-fold after 5 weeks of culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In cultures of AA cells, both the number and the survival rate of clonogenic precursors were severely impaired even in the presence of flt3L, which, however, yielded a two- to sixfold enhancement of CFU and HPP-CFC numbers at 1 to 2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In comparison with the hematopoietic function of human Dexter-type stroma cultures, murine feeders expressing high levels of membrane-associated human SCF were equivalent in supporting hematopoiesis during the initial 3 to 4 culture weeks when supplemented with flt3L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that soluble flt3L interacts with membrane-bound SCF in supporting the long-term growth of bone marrow progenitor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The hypothesis that SCF and flt3L function synergistically during the very early stages of human hematopoiesis is thereby reinforced </plain></SENT>
