<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe a case of a woman, affected by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000836'>hyperthyroidism</z:hpo>, who suffers from bone marrow <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> during Tapazole treatment, and literature has been reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Stopping <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50673">methimazole</z:chebi> and beginning a therapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi> in high dosage, intravenous IgG in high dosage, filgastrin and danatrol, medullary recover after 11 days of treatment is obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By analyzing our case and the 12 further cases described, we find that the prognosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> during the treatment of antithyroid therapy, is rather good </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Even if the pathogenetic mechanism of Tapazole induced bone marrow <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath>, it seems to be immuno-mediated in most cases, a direct toxicity in bone marrow cannot be excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In examined cases the antithyroid dosage was medium high (mean 40 mg/die) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore the use of Tapazole in low doses (15 mg/die) effective in almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> hyperthyroid patient must be considered, when possible, the best therapeutic choice, since it is safer in the incidence of important side effects such as bone marrow <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath>, especially in elderly patients or in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>chronic renal failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
