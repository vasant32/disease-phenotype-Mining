<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Donor neutrophils were positive for the NA1 antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patient's pretransplant serum contained a neutrophil specific antibody, anti-NA1, reactive against donor neutrophils, which was demonstrable by both granulocyte agglutination and granulocyte cytotoxicity assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The transplant preparative regimen consisted of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, 50 mg/kg/day for 4 days, and total lymphoid irradiation (750 rads, 26 rads/min by 4 meV linear accelerator) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A two plasma volume exchange (4,800 ml) by continuous flow centrifugation with an Aminco cell separator was performed one day prior to transplant because of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860218" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ABO incompatibility</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Following plasma exchange, anti-NA1 cytotoxic titer, 1:8 preexchange, was no longer detectable; anti-NA1 agglutinating titer had only decreased from 1:64 to 1:32 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>She experienced no adverse reaction to transplantation of 4:8 X 10(8) nucleated cells/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Marrow engraftment was demonstrable by Day 14 by steadily increasing leukocyte and platelet counts, red cells of donor ABO group, and bone marrow chromosomes showing a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> male, 46 XY karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This case of successful bone marrow engraftment without delayed neutrophil recovery in the presence of a neutrophil specific antibody NA1 suggest that neutrophil specific antigens are not functionally present on the pluripotent stem cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Histoincompatibility for neutrophil specific determinants need not eliminate the possibility of bone marrow transplantation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> between siblings identical for the major histocompatibility loci </plain></SENT>
