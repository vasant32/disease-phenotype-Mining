<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The positive rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> clones in 678 AA cases at first diagnosis from January 2002 to December 2009 were analyzed, and to compare the response rate and overall survival (OS) between AA patients with or without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> clones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were sequentially followed-up to assess the incidence rate and risk factors for AA evolving to overt <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: (1) Of 119/678 (17.6%) AA patients at initial diagnosis presented with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> clones,the positive rates of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> clones among non-severe AA (NSAA), severe AA (SAA) and very severe AA (VSAA) were 16.7% (37/ 222), 17.3% (45/260) and 18.9% (37/196), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no statistical difference among the three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>(Chi2 = 0.369; P = 0.832); (2) 678 newly diagnosed AA cases were divided into 5 subgroups according to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> clones, severity of disease and treatment regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no statistical difference among the five subgroups regarding 6m-response rate (RR) and OS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>(3) Serial follow-up revealed that persistent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> negative clones were found in 516 (76.1%) cases, and evolved to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> positive clones after therapy in 43 (6.3%) cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Persistent <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> positive clones were found in 72 (10.6%) cases, and disappeared the clones after treatment in 47 (6.9%) cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no statistical difference among the four subgroups in terms of the 6m RR (Chi2 = 2.489,P = 0.426) and OS (P = 0.477); (4) 17 out of 678 AA cases (2.5%) evolved to overt <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> and the estimated incidence of evolution to overt <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> was (3.7 +/- 0.9)% at 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The incidences of AA patients with or without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> clones at initial diagnosis evolved to overt <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> were 3.4% and 2.3%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was no statistical difference between the two groups, (Chi2 = 0.111; P = 0.739); and so was found in OS by Kaplan-Meier analysis (P = 0.868) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Cox regression model analysis showed that none of the severity of AA, with or without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> clone at initial diagnosis, treatment regimen and 6m RR was the risk factor for evolution to overt <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There is no difference between AA patients presented with or without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> clones at initial diagnosis regarding the RR and prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The appearance of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> clones in AA is not identified as a risk factor for developing into overt <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
