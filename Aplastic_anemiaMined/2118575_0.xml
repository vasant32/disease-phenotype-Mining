<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The CSA for granulocyte/macrophage (GM-CSA) in patients was equivalent to that of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> donors, while low burst promoting activity (BPA) was observed in PHA-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LCM</z:e> from 7 adult patients (61 +/- 17%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The ability of BPA production varied widely in 13 children (97 +/- 37%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In some patients, low production of BPA improved after successful treatment of antilymphocyte globulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The IFN-gamma in PHA-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LCM</z:e> disclosed no significant difference between patients and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>From these results, low production of BPA may have a role in the development of AA in certain patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is also suggested that therapy with recombinant cytokines such as GM-CSF and IL-3, detected as BPA in our culture system, could be effective for those patients </plain></SENT>
