<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Change of the proportion of T-lymphocyte subsets was observed in 5 patients with AA after the mononuclear cells were activated with phytohemagglutinin (PHA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Its was shown that the number of CFU-T of the patients with AA was apparently decreased in comparison with that of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (P less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Disorder of T-lymphocyte subsets took place in patients with AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The percentages of CD8 and CD25 lymphocytes were increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The helper: suppressor T-lymphocytes (CD4:CD8) ratio was significantly increased (P less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The ratio of CD4/CD8 in 5 patients with AA was further decreased after activating mononuclear cells with PHA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results showed that the increase of T-lymphocytes in patients with AA may account for the low level of CFU-T; the high level of CFU-T in patients with AA-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> may be related to the multiplication of bone marrow cells </plain></SENT>
