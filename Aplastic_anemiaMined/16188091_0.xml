<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Peripheral white blood cell gene expression profile of 7 benzene poisoning patients, including one <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, was determined by microarray </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seven chips from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> workers were served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cluster analysis of gene expression profile was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Differentially expressed immune genes associated with <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> poisoning were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the 2 779 target genes, 38 genes differentially expressed were identified, including 10 up-regulated genes such as CD59, TRA@, <z:chebi fb="17" ids="50099">MCP</z:chebi> etc, and 14 down-regulated genes such as HLA-DMB, HLA-DQA1, HLA-DPB1, ITGB2, PFC etc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cluster analysis showed that the expression profiles of 38 genes were associated with <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> poisoning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Differentially expressed immune genes may play an important role in the pathogenesis of <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> poisoning </plain></SENT>
