<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>Somatic mutations</z:hpo> in the PIG-A gene result in the deficiency of several <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24410">glycosylphosphatidylinositol</z:chebi>-linked proteins from the surface of blood cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This explains intravascular <z:mp ids='MP_0010163'>hemolysis</z:mp> but does not explain the mechanism of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> that is almost invariably seen in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In view of the close relationship between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> and idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0004157'>IAA</z:mp>), it has been suggested that the 2 disorders might have a similar cellular pathogenesis, namely, that autoreactive T-cell clones are targeting <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSCs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we searched for abnormally expanded T-cell clones by size analysis of the complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) in the beta variable chain (BV) <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>) of the T-cell receptor (TCR) in 19 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>, in 7 multitransfused patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019045" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemoglobinopathy</z:e>. and in 11 age-matched healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found a significantly higher degree of skewness in the TCR BV repertoire of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>, compared with controls (R(2) values 0.82 vs 0.91, P &lt;.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean frequency of skewed families per individual was increased by more than 2-fold in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>, compared with controls (28% +/- 19.6% vs 11.4% +/- 6%, P =.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, several TCR BV families were significantly more frequently skewed in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> than in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings provide experimental support for the concept that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>, like <z:mp ids='MP_0004157'>IAA</z:mp>, has an immune pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, the identification of expanded T-cell clones by CDR3 size analysis will help to investigate the effect of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSC</z:chebi>-specific T cells on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSCs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
