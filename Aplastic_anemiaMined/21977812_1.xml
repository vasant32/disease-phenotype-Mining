<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of Busui Shengxue Granule ((see text) Herbal granule for replenishing marrow to produce blood) on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (CAA) patients' integrin alpha 6 (VLA-6/CD49f) and laminin (Ln) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty-five patients were divided into experimental group and control group through random number table </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were 34 patients, 17 were male and 17 female, aged 2-67, with a medianage of 30.2 +/- 8.6, in the experimental group, including 17 patients of kidney-yin deficiency and 17 of kidney-yang deficiency, treated by Busui Shengxue Granule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were 31 patients in the control group, 16 were male and 15 female, aged 4-65, with a medianage of 31.2 +/- 8.0; administered Zaizhang Shengxue Tablet (see text) Herbal tablet for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both groups were treated for six months and compared with 10 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> persons after the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometry was adopted to detect the change in the expression of VLA-6/CD49f, receptor in mononuclear cells of CAA patients and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> persons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was applied to detect the expression of peripheral serum Ln </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CAA patients' VLA-6/CD49f was in the state of low expression and Ln in the state of high expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After the treatment, both VLA-6/CD49f and Ln were regulated to some extent and the change in the experimental group was better than that of the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Compared with the kidney-yin deficiency patients, those indices of kidney-yang deficiency patients were easier to correct </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The VLA-6/CD49f and Ln expressions of CAA patients are abnormal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The treatment with Busui Shengxue Granule makes both of them improved </plain></SENT>
