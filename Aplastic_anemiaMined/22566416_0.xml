<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patients ranged in age from 3 to 16 years, and the median time from diagnosis to transplantation was 32 months (range: 3-156 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The conditioning regimens consisted of fludarabine, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, and antithymocyte globulin with or without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">Graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GvHD) was prevented by the administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> A, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="168396">mycophenolate</z:chebi> mofetil, with or without anti-CD25 monoclonal antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The grafts were granulocyte colony-stimulating factor-mobilized bone marrow and peripheral blood from HLA antigen-haploidentical donors (3 cases) or peripheral blood only from unrelated HLA antigen-identical donors (3 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MSCs were intravenously injected at a median dose of 1.43 × 10(6)/kg (range: 0.85-2.5 × 10(6)/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean time for neutrophil and platelet recovery was 12.3 and 13.8 days, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> GvHD grade I and II developed in 2 cases, and no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GvHD was documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were alive and transfusion independent at a median follow-up of 15 months (range: 6-29 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our report suggests that cotransplantation of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cells and MSCs might provide an opportunity for therapy for children with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
