<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At day 0, megakaryocytes are mostly immature and only 3% of them are labeled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The number of labeled cells reached 23% after 12 days of culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Interleukin 3 (IL-3) and IL-6 added together at day 10 further increased this number to 31% 2 days later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mature labeled megakaryocytes were more numerous and more strongly labeled than immature ones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that c-fos could play a role in megakaryocytic terminal differentiation, either in the polyploidization or in the thrombopoietic function unique to these cells </plain></SENT>
