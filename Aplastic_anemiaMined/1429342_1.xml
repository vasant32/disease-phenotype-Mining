<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53448">methylcellulose</z:chebi> cultures of marrow cells from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normals</z:mpath> and the patients yielded no erythroid colonies in the absence of rhEpo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normals</z:mpath>, CFU-E and BFU-E colony formation was significantly increased by adding either rhIL-3 or rhGM-CSF with rhEpo, compared with rhEpo alone, and rhIL-3 was more potent than rhGM-CSF to form colony-forming units and burst-forming units of erythroid (CFU-E) (BFU-E) colonies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By adding rhIL-3 with rhEpo, CFU-E colony formation was increased in half of patients with RA, compared with rhEpo alone, and by rhGM-CSF, in one third </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Approximately one third or one fourth of the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> showed increased BFU-E colonies when rhIL-3 or rhGM-CSF were added to rhEpo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cultures containing rhIL-3 or rhGM-CSF with rhEpo yielded larger numbers of BFU-E colonies in half of the patients with nonsevere <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> than those containing rhEpo alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest that the combination of these growth factors, especially rhIL-3 with rhEpo, is applicable to the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> in some patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
