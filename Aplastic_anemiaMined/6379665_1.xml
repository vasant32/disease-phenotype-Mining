<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eighteen of 50 patients given one course of immunosuppression (IS) showed a response, as defined by self-sustaining peripheral blood counts, with no further need for transfusions; 8 of 27 and 2 of 7 patients given, respectively, two or three courses of IS responded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The overall response rate was 28 of 50 (56%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seventeen patients died, 5 are alive but pancytopenic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The actuarial six-year survival is currently 65% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The following prognostic factors on admission were significantly associated with response to IS: 1) age over 30 years (P = .005), 2) a short interval from diagnosis to treatment (P = .03), 3) a small number of transfusions before treatment (P = .004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The sex of the patient, the number of transfusions before treatment, and the number of CFU-c from unfractionated as well as from T-depleted bone marrow had no significant influence on response to IS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After one month from IS, however, patients responding to IS had a significantly (P = .01) higher number of CFU-c on T-depleted marrow cells, compared with nonresponders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The present study confirms that over 50% of patients with SAA can be successfully treated with IS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Older patients, with a short interval from diagnosis to treatment and with rapid recovery of CFU-c growth on T-depleted marrow, have the best chance for autologous hematopoietic reconstitution </plain></SENT>
