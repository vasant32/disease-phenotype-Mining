<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patients with allogeneic grafts were conditioned with regimens that included <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> and had sustained and complete marrow engraftment; subsequent tests were negative for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004818'>paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient receiving a syngeneic graft received marrow infusion without preceding immunosuppression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>He had prompt engraftment, and hematologic variables returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A Ham's test done at 3 years was negative, but a complement lysis sensitivity test done 10 years after grafting was positive; the patient, however, remains asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
