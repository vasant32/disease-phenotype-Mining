<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Naturin, a new Chinese medical herb produced by XingYa Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., has enhanced immune response, inhibited <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035369" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">retroviral infection</z:e> in animal models as well as in clinical studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results demonstrated that the inhibition of Natural Killer (NK) and Lymphokine-activated Killer (LAK) cell activity and lymphocyte proliferation was compromised by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035369" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">retrovirus infection</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0079864" disease_type="Experimental Model of Disease" abbrv="MAIDS">Murine AIDS</z:e>), even immunosuppression induced by surgical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_686'>amputation</z:mpath> can be restored by Naturin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is also shown that Naturin can protect the mice from lethal total body irradiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These studies indicated that Naturin possesses immunomodulatory effects in vivo for a broad range of stresses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results of the clinical studies on Naturin have demonstrated: (a) significantly improved symptoms of patients, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005558'>chronic leukemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e>, and association with the increased number and percentage of CD4 (Helper T-cell) which have been reduced in some patients, (b) Lymphocyte proliferation and NK cell activity which were suppressed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients can be significantly restored by Naturin treatment, (c) the addition of Naturin treatment to patients receiving radiotherapy and chemotherapy augments immune response and reduces radiation and chemotherapy injury, and (d) no cytotoxic side effects were found in patients given Naturin treatment for up to eight months </plain></SENT>
