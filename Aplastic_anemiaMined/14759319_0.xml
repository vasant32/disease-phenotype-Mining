<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has been proved that HPV B19 is associated with a variety of childhood diseases, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo> infectious, transient aplastic crisis, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001973'>idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003040'>arthropathy</z:hpo>, etc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There have been no any effective vaccines to prevent HPV B19 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> so far </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The HPV B19 genome is composed of 5.6 kb single strand DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This genome encodes a nonstructural protein NS1, two structural proteins VP1 and VP2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Most neutralizing linear <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> of HPV B19 cluster in the VP1 unique and VP1-VP2 junction regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only proteins encoded by genes of the VP1 unique and VP1-VP2 junction regions can stimulate bodies to produce protective antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Aim of the present study was to get the VP1 unique region gene of HPV B19 and to analyze the genetic diversity so as to further study its function and application </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The VP1 unique region gene of HPV B19 was amplified from the serum of a child with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001973'>idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura</z:hpo> by PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The purified PCR product was cloned into pGEM-T easy vector and transfected into the host strain E. coli (DH5 alpha) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Positive clones were chosen and then the target gene was sequenced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The target gene sequence of HPV B19 VP1 unique region was amplified and cloned successfully </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It had 705 nucleotides </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Compared with the relevant sequences published in Genbank, the sequencing results were revealed with two <z:chebi fb="9" ids="36976">nucleotides</z:chebi> changes in the HPV B19 VP1 unique region, but their coding amino acid were not changed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: It is suggested that genetic diversity exists in the VP1 unique region of HPV B19 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Construction of the recombinant plasmid of HPV B19 VP1 unique region gene might benefit to further study </plain></SENT>
