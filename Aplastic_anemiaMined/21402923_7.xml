<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The contributing mechanisms responsible for this phenotype remain elusive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we show that transformed human cell lines as well as primitive hematopoietic cells exhibit a high frequency of spontaneous chromosome breaks upon BMI1 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> and are hypersensitive to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50902">genotoxic agents</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Consistent with these observations, we found that BMI1 is recruited rapidly to DNA damage foci where it blocks transcriptional elongation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also show that BMI1 contributes to homologous recombination DNA repair and is required for checkpoint recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Taken together, our results suggest that BMI1 is critical for the maintenance of chromosome integrity in both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and transformed cells </plain></SENT>
