<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-vs.-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) is a serious complication that affects long-term survivors following bone marrow transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is the result of an immunologic reaction mounted by the grafted reticuloendothelial cells against the tissues of the recipient, and it affects multiple organ systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Involvement of the skin and mucosal surfaces of the head and neck region, in particular the oral cavity, occurs in a large number of patients with GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this report we present four patients with GVHD in whom mucosal lesions and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> of the head and neck region were prominent features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our observations indicate that the clinical and histological characteristics of these lesions vary according to the time elapsed from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, clinical examination of the head and neck region and biopsy of the oral mucosa are important not only in the diagnosis of the GVHD, but also in the evaluation of its progress and response to treatment </plain></SENT>
