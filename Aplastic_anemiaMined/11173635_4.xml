<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The association between severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) and DR2 antigen seems to be well established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, since discrimination between two DR2-associated splits, namely DR15 and DR16, rarely was performed, it remains unclear whether one or both of these subvariants are responsible for AA susceptibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we have analyzed the HLA-DR allelic distribution in a group of 37 AA patients of slavic origin from North-Western Russia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The experimental design included PCR-based amplification of DRB-specific sequences, followed by reverse dot-blot hybridization of the biotinylated PCR-product with the set of sequence-specific oligonucleotide probes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>HLA-DRB alleles were identified by non-radioactive enzymatic reaction, then standard serological specificities of HLA-DR antigen were estimated according to the WHO nomenclature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Whereas DR15 subtype occurred more often in the patients (23.0% vs. 13.3%, p&lt; 0.05), DR16 split did not show the same tendency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results, show the overall predominance of HLA-DR2 specificity (DR15+DR16) did not reach statistical significance (24.4% vs.17.5%, p&lt;0.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, we conclude that repeatedly reported DR2 frequency increase in AA patients is mainly attributed to the prevalence of DR15 subtype </plain></SENT>
