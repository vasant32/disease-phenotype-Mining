<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the different medical conditions associated with red cell <z:mp ids='MP_0000248'>macrocytosis</z:mp> were retrospectively reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One hundred forty-six children between 6 months and 12 years of age with a mean corpuscular volume greater than or equal to 90 fL were identified during a 13-month period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The most common association with <z:mp ids='MP_0000248'>macrocytosis</z:mp> was drug ingestion (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">anticonvulsants</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="15" ids="10110">zidovudine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressive agents</z:chebi>), observed in 51 (35%) of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Other conditions associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0000248'>macrocytosis</z:mp> were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002564'>congenital heart disease</z:hpo> (20), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Down syndrome</z:e> (12), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001923'>reticulocytosis</z:hpo> (11), and marrow failure/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> (6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Miscellaneous diseases were identified in 21 children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four cases had no apparent cause of their <z:mp ids='MP_0000248'>macrocytosis</z:mp>; 21 of them had just a slight elevation of the mean corpuscular volume (91 or 92 fL), suggesting that these values probably represent the upper limit of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No cases of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17439">vitamin B12</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37445">folate</z:chebi> deficiency were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The use of relatively new drugs such as valproate, <z:chebi fb="15" ids="10110">zidovudine</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressants</z:chebi> (for the treatment of diverse medical conditions) accounted for more than half of the cases of drug administration and 24% of the children with <z:mp ids='MP_0000248'>macrocytosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> had <z:mp ids='MP_0000248'>macrocytosis</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo>, suggesting that this finding might be the first manifestation of serious but treatable disorders such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
