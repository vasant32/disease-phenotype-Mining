<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There have been several cases of autoimmune <z:hpo ids='HP_0000820'>thyroid disease</z:hpo> (AITD) occurring after BMT, but AITD remission has been rarely reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We present four cases in which the remission or transfer of AITD occurred after an allogeneic BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (SAA) showed evidence of remission of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000872'>Hashimoto's thyroiditis</z:hpo> which they had before allogeneic BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One patient with SAA, which developed during treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8502">propylthiouracil</z:chebi> for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018213" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Graves' disease</z:e>, underwent allogeneic BMT and showed evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018213" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Graves' disease</z:e> remission following BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In one patient, new AITD occurred after an allogeneic BMT from an HLA-matched sibling who already had AITD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These cases support the evidence that the immune system is newly reconstituted after BMT, and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> can be an indication for BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To fully understand the real changes in autoimmune status after BMT, long-term prospective studies are necessary </plain></SENT>
