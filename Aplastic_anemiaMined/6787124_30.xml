<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The relative distribution of T cell subsets, as defined by the monoclonal antibodies OKT, was analyzed in peripheral blood lymphocytes of 8 children after bone marrow transplantation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The percentage of peripheral blood lymphocytes binding OKT3 (directed against a common T cell surface antigen and defining most peripheral T cells) reached <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values shortly after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 5 patients, lymphocytes binding OKT8 (directed against an antigen present on the suppressor/cytotoxic T cell subset) were found in high proportion, and lymphocytes binding OKT4 (detecting an antigen present on inducer/helper T cells) in low percentage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This resulted in an inverted ratio OKT4/OKT8 compared with that of lymphocytes from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients the lymphocytes bound abnormally high amounts of OKT10 (directed against an antigen present on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> thymocytes but not on mature peripheral T cells) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the course of time, a trend towards normalization was observed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> parameters investigated; however, the kinetics of the recovery showed a marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>From the analysis of this phenomenon, it is likely that, among other conditions yet unknown, a minimum of 20% of OKT4-positive lymphocytes is required for a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> proliferative response to T cell <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogens</z:chebi> in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No other correlation was found between any lymphocyte phenotype, as defined by the OKT antibodies, and proliferative response in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, lymphocytes from the patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-vs-host disease</z:e> (greater than 50% OKT8 positive) failed to suppress the proliferative response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogens</z:chebi> and antigens of the lymphocytes of the histo-identical bone marrow donor </plain></SENT>
