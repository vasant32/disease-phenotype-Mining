<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Culture system of bone marrow MSC from AA children and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> children in vitro was established, and the effects of Tα1 on expressions of tlr9 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="37709">ido</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> of MSC from AA children and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> children were determined by RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the bone marrow MSC from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> children did not express tlr9 and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="37709">ido</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow MSC from children with AA obviously expressed tlr9 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> , but did not express <z:chebi fb="2" ids="37709">ido</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>; AA children's MSC treated with Tα1 for 18 hours markedly down-regulated tlr9 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression, but up-regulated <z:chebi fb="2" ids="37709">ido</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression in the concentration- and time-dependent ways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that Tα1 can up-regulate the expression of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="37709">ido</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in bone marrow MSC from children with AA </plain></SENT>
