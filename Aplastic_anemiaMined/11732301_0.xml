<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SETTING: University Medical Unit at the National Hospital, Colombo, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Institute, Maharagama, and the Lady Ridgeway Children's Hospital, Colombo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: One to 5 ml of blood for serology was collected from 200 multiply transfused patients (those who have received five or more blood transfusions) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: The sera were tested for HCV specific antibodies using a third generation anti-HCV enzyme immuno-assay (EIA) kit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> sera giving positive or intermediate EIA results were re-tested by a commercial HCV Western blot confirmatory test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 200 patients, 10 (5%) were repeatedly positive and confirmed by the Western blot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>33% (7/21) of haemophiliacs and 10% (3/31) of thalassaemics were positive for antibodies to HCV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Antibodies were not detected in other groups of multiply transfused patients (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1263988" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">haemolytic disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemias</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>chronic renal failure</z:hpo>, haematological and other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the 200 patients, those who have had more than 80 blood transfusions had a significantly higher prevalence of antibodies to HCV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The frequency of HCV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> was also higher among those who had received factor concentrates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: 33% of haemophiliacs and 10% of thalassaemics who have received multiple transfusions were infected with HCV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings warrant a larger study among blood donors, and justify screening and decontamination of blood and blood products given to haemophiliacs and thalassaemics in Sri Lanka </plain></SENT>
