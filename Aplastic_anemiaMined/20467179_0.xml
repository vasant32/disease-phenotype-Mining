<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patient showed signs of EBV reactivation as early as 34 days after UBMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our weekly schedule for EBV monitoring failed to trace rapid changes in EBV <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> load and the patient eventually developed EBV-LPD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, early intervention with monoclonal antibody against CD20, rituximab, stopped the further progression of EBV-LPD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As several recent reports have suggested, the safety and efficacy of rituximab treatment for EBV-LPD is supported by our limited experience with post transplant EBV-LPD </plain></SENT>
