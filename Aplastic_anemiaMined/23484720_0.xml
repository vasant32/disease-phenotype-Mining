<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The proportion of the cytotoxic T cells and part of the T-cells subsets in peripheral blood were detected by flow cytometry in 35 cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, including 19 <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-RA), 16 <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>), 17 AA, 15 AML patients and 10 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> donors respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results showed that compared with the control group, the percentage of Tc1, Tc1/Tc2, CD8(+)HLA-DR(+), CD3(+)CD8(+)CD28(+), CD8(+)CD45RO(+) cells was significantly higher and the percentage of CD8(+)CD45RA(+) was significantly lower in AA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-RA group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in the percentage of Tc2 cells between AA/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-RA and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls; the percentage of CD8(+)CD45RO(+) cells was significantly higher and the percentage of Tc1, CD3(+)CD8(+)CD28(+), CD8(+)HLA-DR(+) was significantly lower in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> group, the percentage of CD8(+)CD45RA(+) was lower but the difference was not significant, and there was no difference in the percentage of Tc, Tc1/Tc2 cells between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> group and the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The percentage of Tc2 cells was significantly higher and the percentage of other parameters was significantly lower in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> group than those of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the cellular immune statuses in AA, the different stages of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> are different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In AA and the early stage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, the balance of Tc1/Tc2 shifts to Tc1, and the activation of T-cell subsets increases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the late stage of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, the balance of Tc1/Tc2 shifts to Tc2, the activation of T-cell subsets decreases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The former may be closely related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> while the latter may be one of the important mechanisms in which the malignant clones escape from immune effect </plain></SENT>
