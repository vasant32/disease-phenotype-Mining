<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report the results of the first prospective randomized multicenter study of immunosuppressive treatment in patients with previously untreated nonsevere <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) as defined by a neutrophil count of at least 0.5 x 10(9)/L and transfusion dependence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients were randomized to receive cyclosporin (CSA) alone or the combination of horse antithymocyte globulin ([ATG] Lymphoglobuline; Merieux, Lyon, France) and CSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The endpoint of the study was the hematologic response at 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One hundred fifteen patients were randomized and assessable with a median follow-up period of 36 months; 61 received CSA and 54 ATG and CSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the CSA group, the percentage of complete and partial responders was 23% and 23%, respectively, for an overall response rate of 46% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A significantly higher overall response rate of 74% was found in the ATG and CSA group, with 57% complete and 17% partial responders (P = </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with CSA alone, the combination of ATG and CSA resulted in a significantly higher median <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> level and platelet count at 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fewer patients required a second course of treatment before 6 months due to a nonresponse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the CSA group, 15 of 61 (25%) patients required a course of ATG before 6 months because of disease progression, compared with only 3 of 54 (6%) in the ATG and CSA group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The survival probabilities for the two groups were comparable, 93% (CSA group) and 91% (ATG and CSA group), but at 180 days, the prevalence of patients surviving free of transfusions, which excluded patients requiring second treatment because of nonresponse, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, disease progression, or relapse, was 67% in the CSA group and 90% in the ATG and CSA group (P =.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the combination of ATG and CSA is superior to CSA alone in terms of the hematologic response, the quality of response, and early mortality, and a second course of immunosuppression is less frequently required </plain></SENT>
