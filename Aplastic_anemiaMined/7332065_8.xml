<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These patients, however, exhibited many features similar to other constitutional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic disease</z:e>, such as Fanconi's <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, which are atypical for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272170" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Shwachman syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These features include severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo>, markedly decreased colony forming units in culture (CFU-C), a response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi>, and leukemic transformation </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These patients demonstrate the extreme clinical severity which can be seen in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272170" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Shwachman syndrome</z:e>, as well as the gamut of shared characteristics among the various syndromes associated with constitutional hematologic aberrations </plain></SENT>
