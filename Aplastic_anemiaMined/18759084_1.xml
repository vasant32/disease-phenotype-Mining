<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Clinical and laboratory features of children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> diagnosed in the past six years at our centre were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Various investigations done included a complete blood count and peripheral smear examination, plasma <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>, urine hemosiderin, acid ham test, <z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi> lysis test, immunophenotyping of erythrocytes by sephadex column gel card and of granulocytes by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were 18 children with a marked male predominance (M 14: F 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000980'>Pallor</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000952'>jaundice</z:hpo>, dark urine and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> manifestations were the major presenting complaints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One girl suffered an arterial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> children had cytopenia in at least one cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Children were treated with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="4315">danazol</z:chebi>, stanazolol, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> variously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall response rate was 61% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Children with classical <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> performed slightly better with response rates of 66% (6/9) as compared to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> group which has a response rate of 55% (5/9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Amongst various variables only <z:chebi fb="1" ids="4315">danazol</z:chebi> correlated with better response (p=0.029) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> is an uncommon disease in children and should be included in the differential diagnosis of children presenting with cytopenia </plain></SENT>
