<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is hypothesized that T lymphocytes play a major role in destroying the bone marrow (BM) stem cells of AA patients by infiltrating the BM and secreting excessive levels of anti-hematopoietic cytokines, interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We undertook this study to assess the pathogenic significance of anti-hematopoietic cytokines such as IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha in BM T cells and plasma of AA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Significantly elevated levels of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha were found in the BM plasma of AA patients compared to controls (p=0.05 and 0.006, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Intracellular IFN-gamma and not TNF-alpha in BM CD3+ T cells of AA patients was significantly higher compared to controls (p=0.04 and p=0.2, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A follow-up analysis of expression of these cytokines in BM T cells and their levels in BM plasma in five AA patients before and 180 days (6 months) after antithymocyte globulin (ATG) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> (CsA) therapy showed a decline 180 days after therapy compared to pre-therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We thus conclude that increased production of both IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha in the BM may contribute to disease pathogenesis in AA and ATG therapy may induce hematological remission by suppressing the elevated levels of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha in AA BM </plain></SENT>
