<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We established a B-cell line from the bone marrow of a patient in complete remission following allogeneic BMT for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> 18 months post-grafting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Differences in sex and isoenzymes allowed an exact determination of chimerism in our case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>While the patient showed persistent complete chimerism of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cell lineages, cells grown in culture were of recipient type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They expressed B-cell markers, showed a monoclonal rearrangement of the immunoglobulin genes and carried EBV-associated antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As direct preparations of cells from the patient did not contain detectable recipient-type cells, it appeared likely that small numbers of EBV-transformed B cells of the recipient survived for long periods in this patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For the development of secondary B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> in vivo, additional patho-physiological steps like severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft versus host disease</z:e> or T-cell suppression are obviously required because the patient was still free of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> 3 years post-grafting </plain></SENT>
