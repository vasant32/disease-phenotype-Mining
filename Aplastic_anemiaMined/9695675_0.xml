<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 34-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital because of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>She had been given a diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001973'>idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura</z:hpo> during her first pregnancy about 7 years earlier </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patient received a diagnosis of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) and was treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi>, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), but no hematological improvement was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Six months later, myeloblasts appeared in the patient's peripheral blood, and she was given a diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelocytic leukemia</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (FAB : M2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No chromosomal abnormalities were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As some dyshematopoietic features had been observed in the bone marrow when the patient was first given a diagnosis of AA, it is conceivable that she already had hypoplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) then </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>She was treated according to the JALSG-AML92 protocol and achieved complete remission (CR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In this case, the long-term administration of G-CSF may have played an important role in the transformation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> into <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It may be difficult to strictly distinguish AA from hypoplastic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with slight dysplastic features, as in this case, because we have no established criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Recently the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> in AA patients undergoing G-CSF treatment has become a concern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We should be careful about ruling out hypoplastic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> when diagnosing a condition as AA, especially when therapy includes G-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The patient is still in CR 26 months after intensive combination chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
