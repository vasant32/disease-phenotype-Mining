<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied the production of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) by peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 48 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Detectable concentrations of spontaneous GM-CSF production, ranging from 1.0 to 480 pg/ml (mean +/- SD, 51 +/- 100 pg/ml), were observed in 45 of 48 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These concentrations were not significantly different from those observed in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Phytohemagglutinin-stimulated production of GM-CSF in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, ranged from 1.0 to 2,610 pg/ml (mean +/- SD, 754 +/- 550 pg/ml), which was significantly higher than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The spontaneous production of GM-CSF increased following antilymphocyte globulin (ALG) treatment in 7 of the 11 ALG responders and in 4 of the 14 nonresponders (p = 0.08) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The present observations support the hypothesis that ALG functions as an inducer of hematopoietic growth factor in order to restore hematopoiesis </plain></SENT>
