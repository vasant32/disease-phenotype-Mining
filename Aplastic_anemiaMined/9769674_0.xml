<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As the patient did not react to the androgenic therapy and he had a healthy twin-brother with the same blood group and HLA system and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MCL</z:e>, differing only in Rh genotype, bone marrow transplantation was suggested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Attempted transplantation without immunosuppression and with a small number of bone marrow cells was performed in 1976 at the Military Medical Academy (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="34840">MMA</z:chebi>) in Belgrade, but it was unsuccessful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient suffered from a serious <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> and hemorrhagic syndrome, and survived due to blood transfusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were 56 blood transfusions with more than 20 liters of blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At that time bone marrow transplantations were not performed in Yugoslavia, only <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34840">MMA</z:chebi> started this method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patient could not be transported, so the author with his associates decided to perform a new transplantation with immunosuppressive therapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> and with sufficient number of bone marrow cells, believing that it was the only chance their patient had to get better </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Without special equipment, improvising a <z:mp ids='MP_0001924'>sterile</z:mp> room, the author performed a new transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two weeks later first signs of improvement of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> occurred, whereas after reticulocytic crisis, 45 days later, the number of blood cells reached <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On the occasion of examining Rh genotype of our patient it was established that, instead of previous Rh genotype inherited from his father, after retransplantation he had a new Rh phenotype acquired from his brother who inherited it from their mother </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It was a proof that the transplantation was a complete success </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>On the occasion of 20th anniversary of that event in 1977, the whole team, which had performed the retransplantation, met their ex-patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Today he is healthy, employed and a successful sportsman </plain></SENT>
