<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Patients who undergo bone marrow transplantation are generally immunosuppressed with a dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (CYA) which is usually calculated based on the patient's weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At these high doses of CYA, serious cardiotoxicity may occur, but definitive risk factors for the development of such cardiotoxicity have not been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since chemotherapeutic agent toxicity generally correlates with dose per body surface area, we retrospectively calculated the dose of CYA in patients transplanted at our institution to determine whether the incidence of CYA cardiotoxicity correlated with the dose per body surface area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eighty patients who were to receive CYA 50 mg/kg/d for four days as preparation for marrow grafting underwent a total of 84 transplants for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043194" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome</z:e>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004430'>severe combined immunodeficiency</z:hpo> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fourteen of 84 (17%) patients had symptoms and signs consistent with CYA cardiotoxicity within ten days of receiving 1 to 4 doses of CYA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six of the 14 patients died with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The dose of CYA per body surface area was calculated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients and the patients were divided into two groups based on daily CYA dose: Group 1, CYA less than or equal to 1.55 g/m2/d; Group 2, CYA greater than 1.55 g/m2/d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cardiotoxicity that was thought to be related to CYA occurred in 1/32 (3%) of patients in Group 1 and in 13/52 (25%) patients in Group 2 (P less than 0.025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>Congestive heart failure</z:hpo> caused or contributed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in 0/32 patients in Group 1 v 6/52 (12%) of patients in Group 2 (P less than 0.25) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in the rate of engraftment of evaluable patients in the two groups (P greater than 0.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the CYA cardiotoxicity correlates with CYA dosage as calculated by body surface area, and that patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiencies</z:hpo> can be effectively prepared for bone marrow grafting at a CYA dose of 1.55 g/m2/d for four days with a lower incidence of cardiotoxicity than patients whose CYA dosage is calculated based on weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This study reaffirms the principle that drug toxicity correlates with dose per body surface area </plain></SENT>
