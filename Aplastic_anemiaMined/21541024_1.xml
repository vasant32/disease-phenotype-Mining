<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Transplantation of these cells is a first-line treatment option if HLA-matched related donors are available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>First-line immunosuppressive therapy may be offered as alternative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim was to compare the outcome of these patients in controlled trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A systematic search was performed in the bibliographic databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, and The Cochrane Library </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To show an overview of various outcomes by treatment group we conducted a meta-analysis on overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We evaluated whether studies reported statistically significant factors for improved survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: 26 non-randomized controlled trials (7,955 patients enrolled from 1970 to 2001) were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We did not identify any RCTs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Risk of bias was high except in 4 studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Young age and recent year of treatment were identified as factors for improved survival in the HSCT group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Advanced age, SAA without very severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, and combination of anti-lymphocyte globulin with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> A were factors for improved survival in the IST group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In 19 studies (4,855 patients), summary statistics were sufficient to be included in meta-analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Considerable <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> did not justify a pooled estimate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Adverse events were inconsistently reported and varied significantly across studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Young age and recent year of treatment were identified as factors for improved survival in the transplant group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Advanced age, SAA without very severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, and combination of anti-lymphocyte globulin with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> A were factors for improved survival in the immunosuppressive group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Considerable <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of non-randomized controlled studies did not justify a pooled estimate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Adverse events were inconsistently reported and varied significantly across studies </plain></SENT>
