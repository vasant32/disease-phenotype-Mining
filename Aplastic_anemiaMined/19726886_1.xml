<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-nine bone marrow specimens were collected from 20 AA patients, 19 specimens from initial diagnosis and 10 from follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>T cell clonality assay was performed using IdentiClone TCRB Gene Clonality Assay kit (InVivoScirbe Technology, USA) and automatic genetic analyzer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients' clinical information and laboratory parameters were also analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Five patients had definitive underlying factors related with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> B virus (4 cases) and <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> exposure (1 case) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Putative T cell clones were detected in bone marrow specimens of 11 (58%) out of 19 patients at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The location of putative T cell clones of TCRB gene (diversity region, Dbeta; joining region, Jbeta; variable region, Vbeta) was distributed in Dbeta2+Jbeta2 (6 cases), Dbeta1+Jbeta1 (3 cases), Vbeta+Jbeta1 (2 cases), and Dbeta1+Jbeta2 (2 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, among seven patients who underwent stem cell transplantation, five patients with no T cell clones detected at diagnosis developed new T cell clones during the follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Putative pathogenetic T cell clones were detected in most of AA patients in the current study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>T cell clonality assay would be useful for investigating the pathophysiology of acquired AA </plain></SENT>
