<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To analyze the outcome of childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> received allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and immunosuppressive therapy (IST) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The clinical data of 125 consecutive children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) in our hospital were retrospectively analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: According to the clinical manifestations, the 125 AA children were divided into two groups: SAA (n = 79) and NSAA (n = 46) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference between the two groups in sex, age and follow-up duration (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up was 25 (6 - 89) months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>103 cases received IST and 22 received allogenic HSCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In SAA group, the response rate was better in patients received allogenic HSCT (n = 21) than in those received IST (n = 58) (85.7% vs 53.4%, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SAA patients received IST were further divided into two groups: 47 received antithymocyte globulin (ATG) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi>-A (CsA) combined therapy, 11 received CsA alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in total response rates (55.3% vs 45.5%, P = 0.555) and cure rates (42.6% vs 27.3%, P = 0.499) between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In NSAA group, 45 patients received IST and 1 received allogenic HSCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the IST treated NSAA patients, there was also no statistic significance in cure rates (36.4% vs 32.4%, P = 0.806) and total effective rates (63.6% vs 64.7%, P = 0.949) between ATG and CsA combined therapy (n = 11) and CsA alone therapy (n = 34) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The outcome of children with AA received allogenic HSCT was obviously better than those received IST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>IST is still the choice for patients without suitable donors for HSCT </plain></SENT>
