<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Quantitative bone histology was carried out in five osteosclerotic adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The bone was extremely hard in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, and open biopsy was usually required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One patient, aged 18 years, presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001908'>hypoplastic anemia</z:hpo>, and the most probable explanation for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011001'>osteosclerosis</z:hpo> is a marrow stem cell defect leading to defective osteoclasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Another had the dominant form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011002'>osteopetrosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Her bone contained cartilage remnants, and there were many large, morphologically abnormal osteoclasts, which lacked <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cytoplasmic acid phosphatase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The third patient had <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>chronic renal failure</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002749'>osteomalacia</z:hpo>; here the <z:mp ids='MP_0005605'>increased bone mass</z:mp> might have resulted from an inability of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> osteoclasts to resorb bone, due to the surface coating of osteoid, though an earlier increase of bone formation cannot be excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The fourth patient, who suffered from systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100495'>mastocytosis</z:hpo>, had high turnover bone, with greatly increased bone formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The fifth patient, with fluorosis of bone, also had increased bone formation and resorption, the process being much more pronounced in the head of her pathologically fractured femur than it was in the iliac crest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In this patient some osteoclasts had reduced acid phosphatase activity and long cytoplasmic extensions, both changes similar to those observed in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29262">diphosphonate</z:chebi>-treated animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Very diverse processes can result in the <z:mp ids='MP_0010872'>increased cancellous bone mass</z:mp> producing the radiographic appearance of diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0011001'>osteosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
