<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and ten patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> who needed long-term platelet transfusion were regularly screened for platelet associated antibodies by a combination of platelet suspension immunofluorescence test (PSIFT) and lymphocytotoxicity test (LCT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Subsequently 13 of the patients (56.5%) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and 7 of the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (70%) became alloimmunized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The overall incidence was 60.6% (20/33) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The concordance of PSIFT and LCT was 100%, suggesting that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the platelet associated antibodies were of HLA specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The identified antibodies were anti-A2, A11, A24, B5, B40, B46, B57, B60 and B62 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Most of them were antibodies against the high frequency HLA antigens in the Chinese population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no dose-response relationship in the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948201" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">alloimmunization</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The interval between the initiation of platelet transfusion and the development of antibody varied from 10 to 192 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The immunization is of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> or none response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In our study group, about 40% of the patients who did not develop alloantibody within six months will never do so </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We concluded that platelet transfusion should not be withheld for fear of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948201" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">alloimmunization</z:e> and that HLA matched or lymphocytotoxic compatible platelet-donors may be helpful to alloimmunized patients </plain></SENT>
