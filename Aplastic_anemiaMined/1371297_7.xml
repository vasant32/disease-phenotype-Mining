<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Literature review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> articles published in English language between 1987 and 1990 were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Those reporting studies without age limits as entry criteria and describing the effects of growth factors in individual patients were suitable for analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow transplantation related articles were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The meanfold increase of granulocytes for Granulocyte-Colony Stimulating Factor, Granulocyte Macrophage-Colony Stimulating Factor, and Interleukin 3 and of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> for erythropoietin were compared in subjects younger and older than 65, by Mann-Whitney U test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 68 studies, 23 were suitable for analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These included patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, chemotherapy-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854467" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myelosuppression</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001913'>granulocytopenia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854467" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myelosuppression</z:e> of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> and of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of 204 patients, 67 were 65 years of age or older and 42 were over 70 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No difference was seen in meanfold increase of granulocyte and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> in time of response to growth factors or in response in presence of an absolute neutrophil count lower than 1000/microliters between younger and older patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Early response to hemopoietic growth factors appears well maintained with advanced age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Prospective studies of the prolonged effects of these factors in older and younger patients are needed </plain></SENT>
