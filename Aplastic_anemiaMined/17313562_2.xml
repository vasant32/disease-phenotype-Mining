<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We treated two patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) and one patient with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (SAA) with HLA-mismatched stem cell transplantation (SCT) from NIMA-complementary donors (NIMA-mismatched SCT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The presence of donor and recipient-derived blood cells in the peripheral blood of recipient (donor microchimerism) and donor was documented respectively by amplifying NIMA-derived DNA in two of the three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Graft rejection occurred in the SAA patient who was conditioned with a fludarabine-based regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Grade III and grade IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD developed in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> on day 8 and day 11 respectively, and became a direct cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The findings suggest that intensive conditioning and immunosuppression after stem cell transplantation are needed in NIMA-mismatched SCT even if donor and recipient microchimerisms is detectable in the donor and recipient before SCT </plain></SENT>
