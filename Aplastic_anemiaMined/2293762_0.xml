<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We describe the clinical course of a 16 year old girl with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> who was treated by syngeneic bone marrow transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Engraftment was not obtained by simple infusion of bone marrow without immunosuppression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patient received a high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> and thoracoabdominal irradiation, followed by second marrow transplantation from the same donor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Incomplete but significant hematologic recovery was observed; however, marrow failure recurred 5 months after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Since donor and recipient pairs were genotypically identical, graft failure could not be attributed to immunological reactivity of recipient cells to donor non-HLA antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This case report implies that graft failure in some cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> might be mediated by inhibitory cells resistant to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> and irradiation </plain></SENT>
