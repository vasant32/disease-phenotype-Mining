<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Exposure of humans and experimental animals to <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> has been shown to result in hematotoxicity such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The oxidative activation of the <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> metabolite, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17594">hydroquinone</z:chebi> (HQ), in the bone marrow to the electrophilic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16509,39439">benzoquinone</z:chebi> (BQ) has been suggested to play an important role in <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi>-induced hematotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since the interaction of several <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35703">xenobiotics</z:chebi> with copper has been shown to result in their metabolism, in this study we have investigated the role of copper in the oxidation of HQ and HQ-induced toxicity to mice bone marrow stromal cells, target cells of HQ in the bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In phosphate-buffered saline, HQ underwent autoxidation slowly to BQ, while the presence of Cu(II) ions (1, 2.5, 5, 10, 50 microM) strongly accelerated the oxidation of HQ to BQ in a concentration-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Reaction of HQ with Cu(II) was also accompanied by the reduction of Cu(II) to Cu(I), the utilization of O2, and the concomitant generation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30492">H2O2</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The oxidation of HQ by Cu(II) could be blocked by the Cu(I)-specific <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38161">chelator</z:chebi> bathocuproinedisulfonic acid (BCS), particularly when the ratio of BCS to Cu(II) was 4:1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By observing the kinetics of the reactions derived from mixing 100 microM HQ and 100 microM Cu(II), it was found that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the Cu(II) was reduced to Cu(I) within 5 s, followed by consumption of O2 and the generation of BQ, which reached maximum levels at 4 min after mixing HQ and Cu(II) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, oxidation of HQ by Cu(II) also generated chemiluminescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the presence of myeloperoxidase, Cu(II)-mediated oxidation of HQ was increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Addition of Cu(II) to primary bone marrow stromal cell cultures significantly enhanced HQ-induced cytotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The enhanced cytotoxicity of HQ by Cu(II) could be completely prevented by adding BCS, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> (GSH), or dithiothreitol but not by catalase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Supplementation of stromal cells with 20 microM BCS in the absence of exogenously added Cu(II) significantly abated HQ-induced cellular GSH <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> and cytotoxicity, suggesting a possible involvement of endogenous copper in the activation of HQ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The above results indicate that Cu(II) strongly induces the oxidation of HQ and as such may be a factor involved in the oxidative activation and toxicity of HQ in target cells </plain></SENT>
