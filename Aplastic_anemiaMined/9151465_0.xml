<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fanconi <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (FA) has the similar features of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> but is characterized by spontaneous or induced <z:mp ids='MP_0008866'>chromosomal instability</z:mp> and a variety of congenital anomalies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A cytogenetic breakage study is used to enable the diagnostic differentiation between FA and the so-called "idiopathic" AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This method is based on the effect of the bifunctional <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agent</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27504">mitomycin C</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="172" ids="27504">MMC</z:chebi>) and alkylating <z:chebi fb="1" ids="25435">mutagen</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23704">diepoxybutane</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="23704">DEB</z:chebi>) on the chromosomes of peripheral lymphocytes in culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among thirty-three new cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> with unknown etiologies, three young male patients were confirmed as victims of FA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The methodology and clinical manifestations were discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A prenatal screening was also performed to exclude the possibility of homozygous FA in one fetus at risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The adequate dose of <z:chebi fb="172" ids="27504">MMC</z:chebi> used in our tests for diagnosis of FA were 20 ng/mL, while <z:chebi fb="3" ids="23704">DEB</z:chebi> did not work </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings may suggest genetic diversity or other contributing factors in the pathogenesis of FA </plain></SENT>
