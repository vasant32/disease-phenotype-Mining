<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with a sibling matched at the major histocompatibility region were transplanted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Transplantation was performed with 17-100 (median 33) days of original diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Conventional treatments included transfusion support with or without <z:chebi fb="5" ids="50113">androgens</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four of 36 patients intered on the transplant arm are alive after 4-20 (median 9) mo with full marrow reconstitution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only two are limited by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast only 12 of 31 conventionally treated patients are alive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Six of these survivors have improved, five incompletely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The 19 nontransplant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> have occurred within 1-11 (median 3) mo of diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Compared to nontransplant regimens, early transplantation more effectively restores <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> marrow function and decreases the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> mortality of severe marrow <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> (p = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Pending longer follow-up, early marrow transplantation appears to be the most effective available treatment for severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
