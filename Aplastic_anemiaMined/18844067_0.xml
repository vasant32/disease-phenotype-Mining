<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To quantify the CD4+ CD25+ CD127(low) regulatory T cell (Treg), the expression levels of forkhead/winged helix transcription factor FOXP3 and Notch1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) patients before and after treatment, and explore the significance of Treg in pathogenesis of AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: CD4+ CD25+ and CD4+ CD25+ CD127(low) T cells in peripheral blood were examined with FACS in 29 AA patients at active phase, 14 at recovery phase, 11 at unrecovery phase, and 15 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The levels of FOXP3 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and Notch1 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression were detected with RT-PCR, and the correlations between Treg, FOXP3 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and Notchl <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The percentages of peripheral activated CD4+ CD25+ T cells in AA patients at active phase (4.3 +/- 0.7)% and unrecovery phase (4.2 +/- 0.6)% were significantly higher than those in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (2.4 +/- 0.8)% (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The proportion of these cells in AA patients at recovery phase was reduced to (2.6 +/- 0.7)% (P &lt; 0.05), being no difference from that in control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The number of CD4+ CD25+ CD127(low) T cells in AA patients at active phase (2.4 +/- 1.2)% and unrecovery phase (2.5 +/- 1.1)% was decreased significantly compared with those in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (7.1 +/- 2.7)% (P &lt; 0.01) and in AA patients at recovery phase (5.3 +/- 1.0)% (P &lt; 0.01), there was no difference between the latter two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In active phase AA patients, the levels of FOXP3 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and Notchl <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> (0.260 +/- 0.011 and 0.018 +/- 0.005, respectively) were lower than that in control group (1.307 +/- 0.011 and 0.308 +/- 0.028, respectively) (P &lt; 0.01 and P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After treatment, the levels significantly increased to 1.287 +/- 0.012 and 0.281 +/- 0.013 (P &lt; 0.01 and P &lt; 0.01), but there was no difference with that of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CD4+ CD25+ CD2(low) T cells and FOXP3 were positively related with Notchl (P &lt; 0.01) in AA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The decreased number and suppressive activity of CD4 CD25+ CD127(low) Treg cells in the peripheral blood of AA patients cause over-activation of autoreactive T cells and suppression of haematopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One of the mechanisms maybe the reduced expression of Notch1 in the target cells </plain></SENT>
