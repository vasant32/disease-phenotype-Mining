<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to perform a more detailed analysis of skull base <z:hpo ids='HP_0002754'>osteomyelitis</z:hpo> in the inpatient population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also provide a more comprehensive evaluation of comorbid disease and severity of illness in this population and describe their effects on the duration and cost of hospital stay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Review of the California Hospital Discharge Database between the years 1990 and 2000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Information evaluated included age, race, insurance, charges and length of hospital stay, comorbid disease, severity of illness, and disposition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Data were analyzed using analysis of variance and linear regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall incidence of skull base <z:hpo ids='HP_0002754'>osteomyelitis</z:hpo> ranged from 57 to 95 cases annually (median 75.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Whites (69.3%) were more likely to present with the disease than Native Americans (13.2%), African Americans (6.5%), or Asians (2.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The majority of patients diagnosed with skull base <z:hpo ids='HP_0002754'>osteomyelitis</z:hpo> had Medicare or public assistance (62%) compared with those with Preferred Provider Organization or Health Maintenance Organization insurance (27%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001257'>Increased length</z:mp> of hospital stay and increased charges incurred during hospitalization were significantly associated (P &lt; .05) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002634'>arteriosclerosis</z:hpo>, facial nerve dysfunction, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Severity of illness and the presence of one or more comorbid conditions also significantly affected the duration and charges incurred during hospital stay (P &lt; .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The presence of concurrent illness with skull base <z:hpo ids='HP_0002754'>osteomyelitis</z:hpo> significantly affects the duration of hospital stay and the charges incurred during hospitalization </plain></SENT>
