<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A pivotal regulator of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> is vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we describe analysis of VEGF expression and microvessel density in the bone marrow of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow was examined at diagnosis and at the time of hematological remission after immunosuppressive therapy using anti-thymocyte globulin, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoids</z:chebi> or allogeneic stem cell transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At diagnosis, both VEGF expression and microvessel density were found to be significantly lower in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, 1.1 +/- 0.7 events per field, versus controls, 5.9 +/- 3.0 events per field; P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In response to successful therapy, VEGF and microvessel density in the bone marrow increased substantially </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serum VEGF levels were also found to be significantly lower at diagnosis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> compared to healthy controls (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, 51 +/- 35 pg/ml versus controls, 444 +/- 220 pg/ml; P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>VEGF in the serum increased substantially after successful immunosuppressive therapy or stem cell transplantation (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Taken together, these data show that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> is associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0005602'>reduced angiogenesis</z:mp> and reduced VEGF expression </plain></SENT>
