<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Genetic instability of bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNC) was measured by Comet assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The relationship between <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> parameters and genetic instability results was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The reciprocity of genetic instability and treatment responses to immunosuppressive therapy (IST) was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Comet assay parameters \[tail moment (TM), olive TM (OTM), comet %\] of AA patients were significantly higher than that of control group (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no statistic correlation of comet parameters of severe AA (SAA) BM hematopoietic cells with age, gender and peripheral blood cell count (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For the treatment response rate at six months after IST there was no statistical difference between comet cells of &lt; 21.64% and of &gt;/= 21.64%, and so did between OTM &lt; 1.58 and &gt;/= 1.58 in SAA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>IST had no effect on SAA BMHCGI, whereas, the Comet%, TM and OTM in SAA PR patients and Comet% in CR patients were significantly decreased than those before treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Comet parameters of two SAA patients were significantly increased before the development of clonal cytogenetic abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Increased BMHCGI may be one of the elements in the pathogenetic mechanisms in AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The genetic instability is irrelevant to the SAA patients overall response rate of IST at six months, but IST can alleviate the genetic instabilities in responded SAA patients </plain></SENT>
