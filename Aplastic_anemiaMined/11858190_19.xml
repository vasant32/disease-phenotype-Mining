<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For analysis, patients were divided into group I, transplantations from 1970-1976; group II, 1977-1983; group III, 1984-1990; and group IV, 1991-1997 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The overall incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD was 28% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Incidences of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD for groups I through IV were 20%, 46%, 41%, and 22%, respectively, reflecting added buffy coat infusions in groups II and III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five-year survival rates of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD for groups I through IV were 58%, 74%, 82%, and 76%, respectively (NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among group I patients, 50% were alive off immunosuppression, none were alive on immunosuppression, and 50% died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These figures were 76%, 0%, and 24% in group II; 80%, 10%, and 10% in group III; and 64%, 21%, and 14% in group IV patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>More serious <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> and skin <z:hpo ids='HP_0001371'>contractures</z:hpo> were seen in group I than in groups II, III, and IV (P = .0001, .02, .01 and P =.0003, .001, .05, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Lung complications, aseptic necroses, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>, and Karnofsky scores were comparable among groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Gastrointestinal complications seemed less frequent among groups II through IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>Diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> was more frequent in group IV than in groups I through III (P = .008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">Secondary malignancies</z:e> occurred in 33%, 6%, 3%, and 0% of patients in the 4 groups, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, over 28 years, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD has remained challenging, with only slight improvements in quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Decisive improvements in therapy and survival will have to await both a better understanding of the immunological events underlying <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD and better <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> prevention and control </plain></SENT>
