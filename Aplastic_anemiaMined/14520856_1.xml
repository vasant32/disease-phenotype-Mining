<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: From 1980 to 2000 125 patients with AA were treated with ALG made in Russia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two and three courses of ALG were performed in 25 and 8 patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The treatment was complicated most often with allergic reactions (AR) observed in 42.4% patients, hemorrhagic syndrome (HS) and infectious complications (IC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Goat ALG was more allergic than rabbit ALG (46.2 vs 34.6%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>If the second course was made with ALG of the same kind, AR occurred in 37.5% patients while ALG of the different kind produced complications only in 11.8% patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>HS was recorded in 37.3% patients, its frequency was unrelated to ALG kind and was not severe (71.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>IC occurred in 16.5% patients, their occurrence was also unrelated to the ALG kind and were of the first degree in 63.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Domestic ALG often results in AR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>To reduce frequency and severity of complications in ALG treatment, it is recommended to use long intravenous infusions (12-18 h) and change ALG kind in subsequent ALG courses </plain></SENT>
