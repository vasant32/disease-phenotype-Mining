<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Out of 68 cultures obtained after cloning of the CT lines, 43 showed varying, but always specific, anti-H-Y HLA-A2-restricted lytic capacity on a per-cell basis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We could show that the cloned cultures were composed of &gt;80% T cells that carry the HLA-A, -B, -C, and also the HLA-DR antigens identical to the original PBL </plain></SENT>
