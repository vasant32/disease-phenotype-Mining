<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: 31D8 monoclonal antibody (mAb) has been shown to bind heterogeneously to human neutrophils, identifying subsets of cells which differ in their functional response to chemotactic stimuli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study we used 31D8 mAb to determine whether differences in neutrophil subpopulations might explain the long-lasting decreased chemotaxis observed in bone marrow transplant recipients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty patients with self-sustaining hematopoiesis 1 to 5 years bone marrow transplantation (BMT) (15 allogeneic and 15 autologous) performed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL, 10 patients) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> in complete remission (8 patients), Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (2 patients), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (8 patients) and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (2 patients) were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neutrophil chemotaxis was evaluated using a modified Boyden chamber assay and 31D8 binding was determined by indirect immunofluorescence and cytofluorimetric analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Neutrophil chemotaxis was significantly impaired in the BMT group with respect to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The chemotactic defect strikingly correlated with autologous BMT and, in particular, with ALL as the pre-existing disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No differences between patients and controls were observed in the percentage of 31D8 bright and dull neutrophils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, when mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) was analyzed as a relative measure of 31D8 antigen expression on the overall neutrophil population, a significant decrease was observed in neutrophils from BMT patients with respect to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As for chemotaxis, the impairment of 31D8 binding was more evident in autologous BMT and strikingly correlated with ALL as the pre-existing disease regardless of age, sex and time since BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, a significant positive correlation between impaired chemotaxis and decreased 31D8 binding was found in our patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the decreased neutrophil chemotaxis observed in some BMT patients may be due in part to circulating 31D8 dull neutrophils, although the causes for the decreased 31D8 binding and for the quite pronounced neutrophil defect in ALL patients remain unknown </plain></SENT>
