<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>Monosomy</z:mp> 7 was demonstrated upon karyotypic analysis of bone marrow in both cases at the time <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> developed The first patient was a 25-year-old man diagnosed with AA at age 14, recovered from AA at age 15, developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> at age 21 and turned into <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> at age 25 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The second patient was a 27-year-old man diagnosed with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> at age 22, developed severe AA at age 25 and turned into <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> at age 27 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This latter patient received anti-lymphocyte globulin when he developed severe AA but did not respond well whereas the first patient fully recovered from AA with anabolic hormone treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Time to diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> in the patient who received immunosuppressive therapy was strikingly shorter than that who received conventional <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi> therapy (2 years vs 11 years after AA, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The presence of <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 in leukemic cells of both patients emphasizes its central role in the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> from AA/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, other factors such as choice of AA/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> therapy and patients response may modulate the time to emergence of <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7-carrying <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> clone and frank <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further studies into the biologic and genetic mechanisms involved in the development of leukemic clone arising from AA/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> should be explored </plain></SENT>
