<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>7 patients (35%) showed a good clinical response within 6 months; they were off transfusions and had greater than or equal to 0.8 x 10(9)/l neutrophils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>ATG had the greatest effect on red-cell production and the least on platelet production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The hematological recovery with ATG could not be predicted from the bone-marrow histology, CFU-c growth, or clinical data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, patients with strong HLA antibodies seemed to respond more often </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The actuarial survival was 55% at 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Under intensive supportive care, even 7 out of 12 non-responders were alive after 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>ATG appears to be a useful form of therapy for patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> who are not candidates for bone-marrow transplantation </plain></SENT>
