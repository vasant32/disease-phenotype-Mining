<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To date, however, it is still unclear to what extent hematopoietic progenitor cells (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HPCs</z:e>) from AA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> share biological properties and what the functional differences are between them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In trying to address this issue, in the present study we have analyzed, in a comparative manner, the proliferation and expansion capacities of bone marrow (BM) progenitor cells from AA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in response to recombinant cytokines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>BM samples from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects (NBM) and patients with AA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were enriched for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HPC</z:e> by immunomagnetic-based negative selection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Selected cells were cultured in the absence (control) or in the presence of early-acting cytokines (Mix I), or early-, intermediate- and late-acting cytokines (Mix II) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Proliferation and expansion were assessed periodically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In NBM and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cultures <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was also determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In NBM cultures, Mix I induced a nine-fold increase in total cell numbers and a 3.6-fold increase in colony-forming cell (CFC) numbers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In Mix II-supplemented cultures, total cells were increased 643-fold, and CFC 12.4-fold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In AA cultures, no proliferation or expansion were observed in Mix I-supplemented cultures, whereas only a four-fold increase in total cell numbers was observed in the presence of Mix II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cultures, a 12-fold increase in total cells and a 2.9-fold increase in CFC were observed in the presence of Mix I; on the other hand, Mix II induced a 224-fold increase in total cells and a 5.9-fold increase in CFC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath> was reduced in cytokine-supplemented cultures from NBM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In contrast, Mix II induced a significant increase in the rate of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrate that, as compared to their <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> counterparts, AA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> progenitors are deficient in their proliferation and expansion potentials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Such a deficiency is clearly more pronounced in AA cells, which seem to be unable to respond to several cytokines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> progenitors, on the other hand, are capable to proliferate and expand in response to cytokines; however, their rate of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> is increased by intermediate- and late-acting cytokines, so that the overall proliferation and expansion are significantly lower than those of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> progenitor cells </plain></SENT>
