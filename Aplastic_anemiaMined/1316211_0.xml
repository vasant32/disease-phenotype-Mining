<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A peripheral neutrophil count of 500 cells/cumm is considered to be a good indicator of risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, despite extreme <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> is rare in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> benign <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It may be presumed that adequate marrow reserve delivers mature neutrophil during <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Currently available methods such as determination of blood neutrophil concentration, differential counts, estimation of bone marrow cellularity provide a relatively crude estimates of the functional capacity of the neutrophil system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The use of endotoxin, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28195">etiocholanolone</z:chebi> and steroids have been introduced to determine the marrow neutrophil reserve with greater accuracy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this study, intravenous <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17650">hydrocortisone</z:chebi> 100 mg was used to evaluate marrow neutrophilic reserve in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results showed significant statistical differences (P less than 0.001) between controls and aplastic subjects in 2, 3, 4 and 5th hour groups after steroid injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity and specificity occurring 3 and 4 hours after steroid injection were 78.6% and 100%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> marrow neutrophilic reserve showed more than 1198/cumm of increment neutrophilic counts 4 hours after steroid injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No complication was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The present finding suggests that steroid may be useful as an accurate evaluator of marrow neutrophilic reserve </plain></SENT>
