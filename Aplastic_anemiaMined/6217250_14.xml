<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Forty patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancy</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> were given allogeneic marrow after conditioning with high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> alone or in combination with total body irradiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Between 28 and 3857 days after transplantation, their peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes were tested for reactivity in indirect cell-mediated lympholysis against <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> leukocytes from unrelated individuals, and the results were compared to those with cells from their healthy marrow donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An impairment of cell-mediated lympholysis was found with cells from most patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-vs-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) whereas cells from most short-term and long-term patients without GVHD had cell-mediated lympholysis reactivity comparable to that of cells from the marrow donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When interleukin 2 was added to the mixed leukocyte cultures during the sensitization phase, the impaired cell-mediated immunity of cells from most short-term patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD, but not that of cells from most patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GHVD, could be restored to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results suggest the impairment of cell-mediated immunity seen in cells of short-term patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD is attributable to helper cell defects or to ineffective communication between antigen-presenting cells and helper T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The impairment in cell-mediated immunity seen in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD, however, may reside on the effector cells (or their precursors) or may be due to the presence of suppressor cell activity </plain></SENT>
