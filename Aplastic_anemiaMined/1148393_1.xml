<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A complement-sensitive population of young red cells was found in five of six patients with AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These cells were rapidly cleared from the circulation and were undetectable in the oldest cell fraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Such cells were not found in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls or in a variety of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521860" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic disorders</z:e>, with the exception of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that in most patients with AA, even without any clinical manifestations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>, there is a population of dyserythropoietic, short-lived complement-sensitive cells </plain></SENT>
