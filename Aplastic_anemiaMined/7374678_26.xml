<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have investigated the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> in a young woman </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Her bone-marrow cells, obtained by means of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo>, showed exuberant erythroid growth in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53448">methylcellulose</z:chebi> despite marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0012133'>erythroid hypoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The erythroid nature of the colony growth was further confirmed through measurement of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> synthesis and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="33699">messenger RNA</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="5386">globin</z:chebi> accumulation in a liquid-culture system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, when whole bone fragments were similarly cultured, no appreciable <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> synthesis was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The experimental evidence suggests that, in this patient, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001908'>hypoplastic anemia</z:hpo> resulted from an unfavorable microenvironment </plain></SENT>
