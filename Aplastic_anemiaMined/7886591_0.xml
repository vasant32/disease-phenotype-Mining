<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it is costly and HLA typing to select the compatible donors contributed to its cost </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 53 prospective patients for BMT and their 114 siblings were analyzed to evaluate the use of locally prepared HLA-ABC common typing tray (ABCCT) during Mar 1988-Mar 1992 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 16, 9, 7, 5, 5 and 12 patients were diagnosed as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039730" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thalassemia</z:e>, ALL, ANLL and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0564737" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">other blood diseases</z:e>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It was found that 18 patients were HLA-identical (HLA-ID) with one of their siblings except one patient had 2 HLA-ID sibs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of those who appeared to be HLA-ID were further tested for the HLA-ABCDR typings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It was observed that 16 (88.89%) of 18 patients and 17 (89.47%) of 19 sibs were confirmed as HLA-ID </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After careful clinical screening, only 13 HLA-ID pairs were able to proceed to the mixed lymphocyte culture and confirmed their status of HLA-ID by this test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Finally, only 6 (46.15%) of 13 patients received BMT with a high rate of success, ie <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients have survived with bone marrow engraftment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, ABCCT is very useful for related BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It was highly efficient to exclude HLA-non-ID and haplo-ID yet the cost and workload were greatly reduced </plain></SENT>
