<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Transplantation from an HLA-matched sibling is the treatment of choice for young patients with acquired severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For older patients, the acceptable upper age limit for transplantation as first-line treatment varies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The current analysis, therefore, sought to identify age or ages at transplantation at which survival differed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied the effect of patients' age, adjusting for other significant factors affecting outcomes, in 1307 patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> after HLA-matched sibling transplantation using logistic and Cox regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Age categories (&lt;20 years, 20-40 years, &gt;40 years) were determined using Martingale residual plots for overall survival and categories based on differences in survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients aged over 40 years old were more likely to have had immunosuppressive therapy, a poor performance score and a longer interval between diagnosis and transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neutrophil recovery was similar in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> age groups but patients aged over 40 years had a lower likelihood of platelet recovery compared to patients aged less than 20 years (OR 0.45, P=0.01) but not compared to those aged 20-40 years (OR 0.60, P=0.10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared to the risk of mortality in patients aged less than 20 years, mortality risks were higher in patients over 40 years old (RR 2.70, P&lt;0.0001) and in those aged 20-40 years (RR 1.69, P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mortality risk was also higher in patients aged over 40 years than in those 20-40 years old (RR 1.60, P=0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Mortality risks increased with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Risks were also higher in patients with a poor performance score and when the interval between diagnosis and transplantation was longer than 3 months, implying earlier referral would be appropriate when this treatment option is being considered </plain></SENT>
