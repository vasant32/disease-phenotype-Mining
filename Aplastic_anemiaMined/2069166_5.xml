<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It was significantly higher in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls, both when PBMC were unstimulated or when they were stimulated with PHA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Results from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> patients were also significantly higher than patients who had received allogeneic bone marrow transplants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> patients, the TNF-alpha value produced by PBMC upon stimulation and the platelet count were inversely correlated, as well those patients who had high TNF-alpha values tended to have lower <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> and leukocyte values although this was not significant statistically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the increased production of TNF-alpha by PBMC plays a role in the severe suppression of hematopoiesis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
