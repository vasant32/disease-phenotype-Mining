<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several previous authors, as well as the manufacturer of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690,31163">Diamox</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27690">acetazolamide</z:chebi>) and Neptazane, have recommended routine blood counts for patients on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23018">carbonic anhydrase inhibitors</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four surveys are presented of current practices with regard to blood monitoring </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These include authors of case reports, 40 academic ophthalmologists, 81 ophthalmologists in private practice, and 66 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000501'>glaucoma</z:hpo> specialists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The vast majority does not routinely monitor blood counts of patients on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23018">carbonic anhydrase inhibitors</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The value of routine blood monitoring is questionable both because of (1) the idiosyncratic, non-dose-related mechanism of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0334044" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">dyscrasias</z:e> and (2) the variability of the timing of their <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Regular observation and questioning of patients for symptoms are thought to be preferable </plain></SENT>
