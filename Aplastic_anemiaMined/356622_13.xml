<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> showed marked cortical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_624'>involution</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the short-term survivors the medulla and perivascular spaces were lymphocyte-depleted and the epithelial cells formed pseudorosettes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In those surviving over 2 months, increasing numbers of small lymphocytes were present, presumably reconstituted with donor lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Phagocytosis of cellular debris was frequent, especially in patients with graft-versus-host reaction (GVHR) or treated with anithymocyte globulin (ATG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Plasma cells were numerous in perilobular tissue and were occasionally found within the medulla </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The findings are compatible with the concept that the thymus plays an important role in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immune deficiency</z:hpo> experienced after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation and in the subsequent lymphoid reconstitution </plain></SENT>
