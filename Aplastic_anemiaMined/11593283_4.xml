<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mechanism by which <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressive agents</z:chebi> can cause this syndrome is not clear, but it is probably related with cytotoxic effects of these agents on the vascular endothelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report eight patients who received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> A (CSA) after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation or as treatment for severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (SSA) who developed posterior leucoencephalopathy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The most common signs and symptoms were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neurological dysfunction occurred preceded by or concomitant with <z:mp ids='MP_0002842'>high blood pressure</z:mp> and some degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001919'>acute renal failure</z:hpo> in six patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Computerized tomography studies showed low-density white matter lesions involving the posterior areas of cerebral hemispheres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Symptoms and neuroimaging abnormalities were reversible and improvement occurred in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients when given lower doses of CSA or when the drug was withdrawn </plain></SENT>
