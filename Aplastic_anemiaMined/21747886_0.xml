<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Hypocellularity of bone marrow (BM), not associated with significant dyshematopoiesis, is often found in patients with isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, but its clinical implications have not been studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We prospectively studied the clinical features and natural history of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Adults with isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> (platelet counts &lt;100×10(9)/L) in the absence of dyshematopoiesis, cytogenetic abnormalities, or megakaryocytic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> and who had BM hypocellularity (below 30% in patients aged less than 60 years; below 20% in patients aged 60 years or more) were enrolled at Chungnam National University Hospital between January 2002 and December 2006 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They were monitored regularly for changes in platelet counts or development of additional cytopenia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty patients (17 men and 3 women) were enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median age was 29 years (range, 18-70 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At initial presentation, the platelet counts ranged from 12×10(9)/L to 99×10(9)/L (median, 63×10(9)/L) and were &gt;50×10(9)/L in 16 patients (80%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>BM cellularity ranged from 5% to 25% (median, 15%) and was ≤10% in 6 patients (30%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During the median 48-month follow-up (range, 12-90 months), platelet counts of 3 of the 20 patients recovered to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels (&gt;150×10(9)/L) after 12, 56 and 66 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three patients developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> after 11, 70 and 90 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two patients were consistent with moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, and 1 was confirmed as having refractory cytopenia with multilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the remainder of the patients, platelet counts remained unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> accompanied by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151773" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypocellular marrow</z:e> encompasses a group of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> conditions </plain></SENT>
