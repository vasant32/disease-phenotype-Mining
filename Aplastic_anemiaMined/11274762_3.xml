<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: To clarify the functional capacity of passenger leukocytes, we attempted to enhance their effect in rat heart allograft recipients by selective <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of recipient leukocytes using a monoclonal antibody (mAb) against a recipient-specific allotype of CD45 (RT7(a)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Although antibody treatment of the recipient alone led to profound <z:hpo ids='HP_0001888'>lymphopenia</z:hpo> and reversible <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854467" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myelosuppression</z:e>, additional transplantation of an major histocompatibility complex-incompatible heart graft from an RT7(b) donor led to lethal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> in the recipients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This lethal effect was completely abrogated by postoperative anti-CD3 treatment of the recipient and was partially abrogated or delayed by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of passenger leukocytes through additional anti-RT7(b) antibody treatment of the recipient or gamma-irradiation of the graft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest a role for both donor and recipient-type T cells for the induction of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> in this model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The study shows that, under defined conditions, allogeneic passenger leukocytes in a heart graft can have a profound effect on the recipient's immune system and bone marrow </plain></SENT>
