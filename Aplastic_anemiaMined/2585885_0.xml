<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent investigations have suggested the crucial role of NK cells in the regulation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hematopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, the cytotoxic activity of mononuclear cells from human bone marrow and peripheral blood was examined against three NK-sensitive target cell lines in 15 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> as well as 21 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Marrow mononuclear cells from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> demonstrated a high cytotoxicity comparable to peripheral blood NK cells to these target cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neither large granular lymphocytes nor the cells expressing known NK cell surface phenotypes increased in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1368107" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aplastic marrow</z:e> cell elements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1368107" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aplastic marrow</z:e> cells showed strong killing activity rather than binding at single cell assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>They consisted of non-adherent and adherent cell population in plastic adherence and were unresponsive to IFN treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The existence of cytotoxic cells with high NK-like activity may be responsible for the mechanism of marrow failure in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
