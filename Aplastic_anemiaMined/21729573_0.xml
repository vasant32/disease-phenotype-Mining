<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The records of 114 children with acquired NSAA treated in hospital between January 1996 and January 2009 were analyzed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received stanozolol with the dose of 0.1 mg/(kg·d) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Some patients were treated with supportive care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidence and the risk factors of progression severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (SAA) including gender, age, absolute neutrophil count, absolute reticulocyte count, dependent or independent of transfusion, the ratio of granulocytes and erythrocytes were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results indicated that at a median follow-up of 52 months (range 5 - 181), 6 patients (5.3%) progressed into SAA, 93 (81.6%) remained in NSAA, and 15 (13.2%) had complete remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with dependent of transfusion (platelet count &lt; 10 × 10(9)/L and/or <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> &lt; 70 g/L) have higher risk to progress into SAA (19.2% vs 1.1%) (p = 0.016); patients with lower absolute neutrophil count (ANC) (&lt; 0.8 × 10(9)/L) or with lower absolute reticulocyte count (ARC) (&lt; 40 × 10(9)/L) at diagnosis have higher risk to progress into SAA (8.1% vs 0%) (p = 0.029); (9.1% vs 1.7%) (p = 0.034); Those patients with lower ANC (ANC &lt; 0.8 × 10(9)/L) and lower ARC (ARC &lt; 40 × 10(9)/L) have higher risk into progress to SAA (19.2% vs 1.1%) (p = 0.016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that NSAA patients treated with Stanozolol progress into SAA with the rate of 5.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Those patients with dependent of transfusion or ANC &lt; 0.8 × 10(9)/L or/and ARC &lt; 40 × 10(9)/L have higher risk of progress into SAA </plain></SENT>
