<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) were collected on days 5 and 6 of G-CSF (10 microg/kg/day), and T cells were depleted using an immunoadsorption column (n = 15) or magnetic cell sorting (n = 7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Marrow harvesting was performed 48 hr after the last leukapheresis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two patients (9.1%) that developed graft failure had a successful engraftment again using unpurged PBSC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median time to neutrophils &gt; or = 0.5 x 10(9)/l and platelets &gt; or = 20 x 10(9)/l without platelet transfusions were 12 days and 17 days, respectively </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CD34(+)-enriched PBSC in combination with unmanipulated marrow seem to play a role in overcoming the sensitization to histocompatibility antigens without an apparent increase in GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The stem cell component therapy may be feasible for the high-risk SAA adult patients </plain></SENT>
