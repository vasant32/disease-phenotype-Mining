<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The quantity of CD8+ CD25+ and CD8+ HLA-DR+ cells in PB and the expressions of perforin, granzyme B, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-beta (TNF-beta) and FasL in 29 SAA (14 untreated and 15 recovered) patients and 12 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls were analyzed by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The fraction of CD8+ CD25+ T cells in CD8+ T cells was (3.67 +/- 2.58)% in untreated SAA patients, (5.19 +/- 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>29)% in recovered patients and (4.84 +/- 2.31)% in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls, and that of CD8+ CD25+ T cells in CD3+ cells in the three groups was (2.25 +/- 1.35)%, (2.98 +/- 1.35)% and (2.11 +/- 1.88)%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They had no statistic difference among the 3 groups (P &gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The fraction of CD8+ HLA-DR+ T cells in CD8+ T cells was (39.30 +/- 8.13)% in untreated patients, which was significantly higher than that in recovered patients [(20.65 +/- 5.38)%] and controls [(18.34 +/- 6.68)%] (P&lt;0.001), while there was no statistic difference between the latter two groups (P&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CD8+ HLA-DR+ T cells in CD3+ cells was (27.81 +/- 7.10)% in untreated group, which was significantly higher than that of recovered group [(12.02 +/- 3.03)%] and controls [(8.50 +/-2.33)%] (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>And that in recovered group was higher than that in control group (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The expressions of perforin, granzyme B, TNF-beta and FasL of CD8+ HLA-DR+ T cells in untreated group were 8.51%, 96.08%, 72.11% and 94.25% respectively, which were higher than those in recovered group (1.78%, 85.20%, 34.38% and 51.20%) and controls (1.86%, 82.09% ,17.92% and 32.91%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no statistic difference between recovered patients and controls (P&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There were elevated quantity of CD8+ HLA-DR+ T cells and high expressions of perforin, granzyme B, TNF-beta and FasL in SAA, which might contribute to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
