<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The conventional method done by the manual supravital staining cannot subclassify the group of less than 2% of corrected reticulocyte count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The newly-developed flow cytometer provides different maturation fractions by measuring its fluorescent intensity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The reticulocytes are believed to shift to the circulation from the bone marrow earlier in more severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the role of reticulocyte maturation fractions and bone marrow reticulocyte in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: By using a fully automated counter, the roles of the reticulocyte with maturation and their shifting from bone marrow were evaluated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Different groups of subjects (243 in total) including aplastic, nutritional, and infiltrative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemias</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> due to excess destruction and blood loss were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Each subject had bone marrow examination for morphologic diagnosis and reticulocyte evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both the absolute count and the maturation fractions of reticulocytes showed significant difference among marrow infiltration, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001878'>hemolytic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both the absolute reticulocyte count and less mature fractions were lowest in aplastic group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The marrow reticulocyte counts and shift ratio to circulating blood added little benefit in the classification of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The automated reticulocyte count with maturation fractions helps classify <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemias</z:hpo>, particularly for those with low reticulocyte count by the manual method </plain></SENT>
