<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Amplification refractory mutation system-polymerase chain reaction was used to amplify the polymorphic segments of the IFN-γ +874T/A gene in the samples obtained from 54 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and 51 healthy adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Further, enzyme linked immunosorbent assay was used to assay IFN-γ levels in the blood plasma of 35 patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> before immune suppression therapy and 20 healthy blood donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the frequency of IFN-γ +874 TT genotype in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> was significantly higher than the corresponding frequency in the healthy adults (42.6% vs. 17.6%, χ(2)=13.78, p=0 </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The response rate in severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> patients with increased IFN-γ levels in the blood plasma was higher than that in severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> patients with decreased IFN-γ levels in the blood plasma (73.7% vs. 25.0%, p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the 35 patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, 15 showed the IFN-γ +874 TT genotype, whereas response in 11 patients, the high response rate was significantly in the favor of the IFN-γ +874 TT genotype (73.3% vs. IFN-γ +874 non-TT 35%, p&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the IFN-γ +874T/A gene polymorphism may be correlated with response to immunosuppressive therapy </plain></SENT>
