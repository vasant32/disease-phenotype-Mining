<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: A retrospective analysis was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From 2001 to 2010, 48 patients had SLE related PLE and their clinical characteristics were: age 40.8 ± 14.3 years, male-to-female ratio 1:8.6, mean symptom duration 4.3 ± 3.4 weeks, initial presentation and concomitant activity of SLE in 21(43.8%) and 37 (77.1%) patients, &lt;20% patients developed gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, mean serum albumin level 24.4 ± 5 g/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty (62.5%) patients had diffuse non-erosive erythematous GI mucosa with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> inflammatory cells in lamina propria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Protein leakage was at the small bowel in 15 (31.3%) patients, terminal ileum/caecum in 16 (33.3%) patients and ascending colon in 11 (22.9%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirty (62.5%) patients responded initially well to a combination of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> (AZA) and 33 (68.8%) patients were maintained well by the above therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Higher potent induction and maintenance therapy were required in patients with: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000093'>proteinuria</z:hpo> (p &lt; 0.01), history of previous immunosuppressive therapy (p &lt; 0.02) and requirement of higher potent induction therapy (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>PLE as initial SLE presentation was associated with better prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Four reversible adverse events were reported: one had AZA-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001733'>pancreatitis</z:hpo>, two developed AZA-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001908'>hypoplastic anemia</z:hpo> and one developed steroid <z:hpo ids='HP_0000709'>psychosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One patient developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019360" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="ZONA">shingles</z:e> in the fourth month and responded to oral <z:chebi fb="4" ids="2453">acyclovir</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No <z:hpo ids='HP_0001907'>thromboembolic events</z:hpo> were reported and one patient died of SLE <z:hpo ids='HP_0000112'>nephropathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: There appears to be increasing prevalence of SLE related PLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A diagnosis can be made using 99m Tc-labeled HSA scintigraphy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>PLE generally responds well to immunosuppressive therapy </plain></SENT>
