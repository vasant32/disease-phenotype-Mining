<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Cardiac pathologic findings were analyzed in 22 necropsy cases from a series of 29 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastatic cancer</z:e> who had been treated with ablative therapy followed by bone marrow transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some cardiac alterations were similar to those that occur in patients with hematologic and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">neoplastic diseases</z:e> not treated with bone marrow transplantation, and consisted of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001640'>cardiomegaly</z:hpo>, cardiac <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, foci of <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> due to shock associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001399'>hepatic failure</z:hpo>, myocardial abscesses secondary to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153252" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">systemic candidiasis</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038160" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">staphylococcal infection</z:e>, fibrinous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001701'>pericarditis</z:hpo>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0005639'>hemosiderosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Other cardiac alterations were more specifically related to factors associated with transplantation procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Six patients exhibited a distinctive interstitial reactive change characterized by the presence of (1) moderate to large numbers of Anitschkow cells, occurring alone or in small cellular aggregates and histiocytes, histiocytic cells with nuclei of the Anitschkow type, lymphoid cells, and plasma cells, and (2) nuclei of the Anitschkow type in cardiac vascular and endocardial smooth muscle, endothelial and Schwann cells, and occasional cardiac muscle cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This alteration may have been induced by abnormal immune mechanisms, as suggested by the observation that five of the six patients with interstitial change had clinical evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two patients developed fatal congestive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>cardiac failure</z:hpo> in the early post-transplant period and exhibited myocardial damage with histologic and post-transplant period features indicative of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Findings in these two patients consisted of necrotic muscle cells, which exhibited multiple contraction bands, diastase-resistant <z:chebi fb="61" ids="27565">PAS</z:chebi> staining, and intracellular fibrin deposits; microthrombi, which were composed of fibrin and occasionally of fibrin and platelets; and extravasated erythrocytes and fibrin strands in the interstitium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One of the two patients also exhibited unusual nuclear alterations, which were characterized by replacement of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> chromatin by palely stained fibrous and filamentous material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Clinicopathologic analysis strongly suggested that the fatal cardiotoxicity in both patients resulted primarily from effects of high doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, which were administered as part of a four drug regimen that provided <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> ablation and immunosuppression for bone marrow transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our findings emphasize the need for less toxic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35610">antineoplastic</z:chebi> and immunosuppressive therapy for use in bone marrow transplantation procedures </plain></SENT>
