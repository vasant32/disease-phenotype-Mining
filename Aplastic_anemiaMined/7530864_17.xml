<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Oral exposure of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi>/2 mice to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29865">benzo[a]pyrene</z:chebi> (BP) has been shown to result in hematotoxicity which is manifested as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hematopoiesis is regulated by bone marrow stromal cells, in this study we have characterized the bone marrow stromal toxicity induced by BP and BP-derived metabolites, particularly <z:chebi fb="2" ids="36141">quinones</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Incubation of stromal cells with various concentrations of BP-1,6-, 3,6-, 6,12-, or 7,8-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="36141">quinone</z:chebi> for 24 hr resulted in a significant decrease of cell survival in a concentration-dependent manner, while cells treated with BP or BP-7,8-dihydrodiol did not exhibit any significant <z:mp ids='MP_0000340'>loss of cell</z:mp> survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among the BP <z:chebi fb="2" ids="36141">quinones</z:chebi> examined, BP-1,6-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="36141">quinone</z:chebi> was the most cytotoxic to stromal cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cytotoxicity induced by BP-1,6-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="36141">quinone</z:chebi> also exhibited a time-dependent relationship </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment of stromal cells with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50866">1,2-dithiole-3-thione</z:chebi> (D3T) resulted in a significant induction of both cellular reduced <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> (GSH) content and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36141">quinone</z:chebi> reductase (QR) activity in a concentration-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, D3T pretreatment did not offer any protection against BP-1,6-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="36141">quinone</z:chebi>-induced toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, dicumarol, a potent inhibitor of QR, or buthionine sulfoximine, a specific inhibitor of GSH biosynthesis, did not potentiate BP-1,6-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="36141">quinone</z:chebi>-induced cytotoxicity was not altered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, incubation of stromal cells with BP-1,6-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="36141">quinone</z:chebi> resulted in a significant <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of cellular ATP content and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> morphological changes, which preceded the <z:mp ids='MP_0000340'>loss of cell</z:mp> survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition to BP-1,6-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="36141">quinone</z:chebi>, other cytotoxic BP <z:chebi fb="2" ids="36141">quinones</z:chebi> also exhibited a capacity to deplete cellular ATP level in stromal cells, while BP, which was not cytotoxic to stromal cells, did not elicit any significant decrease in cellular ATP level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest that mitochondria may be a potential target of BP <z:chebi fb="2" ids="36141">quinones</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Overall, the above results indicate that neither cellular GSH and QR nor reactive oxygen species appear to be involved in BP <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36141">quinone</z:chebi>-induced stromal cell injury and that BP <z:chebi fb="2" ids="36141">quinones</z:chebi> may elicit cytotoxicity to stromal cells through directly disrupting <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> energy metabolism </plain></SENT>
