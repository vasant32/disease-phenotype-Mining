<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For deeper insight into T-cell receptor repertoires we developed next-generation-sequencing-spectratyping, which employs high coverage Roche/454 sequencing of T-cell receptor Î²-chain amplicons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For automated analysis of high-throughput-sequencing data, we developed a freely available software, the TCR profiler </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Gene usage, length, encoded amino acid sequence and sequence diversity of the complementarity determining region 3 were determined and comprehensively integrated into a novel complexity score </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Repertoires of CD8+ T-cells from children with idiopathic or <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo>-induced very severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (n=7), children two months after bone marrow transplantation (n=7) and healthy controls (children n=5, adults n=5) were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Complexity scores clearly distinguished between healthy and diseased, and even between different <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immune deficiency</z:hpo> states </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The repertoire of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> patients was dominated by public (i.e. present in more than one person) T-cell receptor clonotypes, whereas only 0.2% or 1.9% were public in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> children and adults, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The CDR3 sequence ASSGVGFSGANVLT was highly prevalent in three cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (15-32% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> sequences), but was only low expressed in idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (2-5%, n=4) or healthy controls (&lt;1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>15 high frequent sequences were present exclusively in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Next-generation-sequencing-spectratyping allows in-depth analysis of T-cell receptor repertoires and their restriction in clinical samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A dominating clonotype was identified in <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> that may be associated with disease pathogenesis and several <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic-anemia</z:hpo>-associated, putatively autoreactive clonotypes were sequenced </plain></SENT>
