<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Intractable <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> or that presumably associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019372" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herpes virus infections</z:e>, sometimes require bone marrow transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the use of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for the treatment of intractable <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Placenta Hominis (PH), steam boiled and roasted, and Cervi Cornus Colla (deer antler glue) has been used in China for hundreds of years to treat <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After consent was obtained, we prescribed these two materials for a 74-year-old female with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and a 26-year-old male with presumably a virus-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Concomitant conventional therapy was continued in both patients as prescribed by their respective attending physicians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Conventional therapy with steroid hormones, immunosuppressive drugs, platelet and erythrocyte transfusions were not effective in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, both patients suffered from serious side effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In two patients, ingestion of Placenta Hominis and Cervi Cornus Colla with TCM prescriptions increased the platelet and enhanced the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> concentration in several months of therapy accompanied by a dramatic improvement in quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The addition to conventional therapy of PH and Cervi Cornus Colla, the latter of which is very easy to obtain, may be one of the potentially advantageous choices in case of otherwise intractable <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
