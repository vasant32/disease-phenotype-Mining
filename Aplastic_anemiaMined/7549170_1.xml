<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The <z:chebi fb="29" ids="35480">analgesic</z:chebi> efficacy of the novel <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">anticonvulsant</z:chebi> felbamate was evaluated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100661'>trigeminal neuralgia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND SETTING: This trial was offered in a tertiary referral center to three outpatients with severe pain who had exhausted other medical options, yet did not wish to undergo surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTIONS: Felbamate was prescribed as the sole <z:chebi fb="29" ids="35480">analgesic</z:chebi> for approximately 1 month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OUTCOME MEASURES: A visual analogue scale was utilized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Felbamate potently diminished the severe pain of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100661'>trigeminal neuralgia</z:hpo> and was well tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The drug was withdrawn because of subsequent reports elsewhere of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001399'>hepatic failure</z:hpo> associated with it when used for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary evidence suggested that felbamate was effective in relieving <z:hpo ids='HP_0100661'>trigeminal neuralgia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Stabilization of neuronal membrane depolarization was the most likely mechanism of action </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, significant potential risks preclude further use of felbamate in the management of nonmalignant pain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Principles that have proven useful in screening for new <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">anticonvulsant</z:chebi> drugs might be relevant to the development of methods by which to search for new <z:chebi fb="29" ids="35480">analgesic</z:chebi> drugs </plain></SENT>
