<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Within the AA-prone dog, a singular phase of progressive decline in blood levels of granulocytes and monocytes was noted along with a similar reduction in marrow progenitors committed to granulocyte/monocyte differentiation (CFU-GM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Measured radioresistance of the preAA CFU-GM in vitro, relative to control CFU-GM from nonirradiated animals, revealed only slightly increased resistance to gamma rays, but significantly increased resistance to fission <z:chebi fb="112" ids="30222">neutrons</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Within the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MPD</z:e>-prone dogs, four preclinical phases (i.e. suppression, partial recovery, accommodation, and preleukemic transition) preceding development of overt <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MPD</z:e> were evidenced by the monitored change in blood granulocyte/monocyte counts and marrow progenitor levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analysis of radioresistance of preMPD CFU-GM revealed marked changes with time of exposure and, in turn, with preclinical phase transitions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Gamma ray resistance increased in the initial phases of exposure, with maximal levels occurring during the middle phase of exposure (accommodation, phase III) followed by a tailing off of resistance at later times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Resistance to fission <z:chebi fb="112" ids="30222">neutrons</z:chebi> by preMPD CFU-GM was observed as well, but somewhat later in the exposure course and at a much lower, more consistent level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These differential patterns of radioresistance expressed by marrow CFU-GM of chronically irradiated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MPD</z:e>-prone dogs to gamma rays and fission <z:chebi fb="112" ids="30222">neutrons</z:chebi> gave rise to preclinical phase-specific 'relative biological effectiveness' (RBE) values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>From these observations, we conclude that: (i) CFU-GM of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MPD</z:e>-prone dogs acquire and maintain marked radioresistance to low linear energy transfer (LET) gamma rays, but only marginally elevated radioresistance to high-LET fission <z:chebi fb="112" ids="30222">neutrons</z:chebi> during the course of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> gamma ray exposure; and (ii) CFU-GM of the AA-prone dog, in contrast, acquire little change in resistance to gamma rays, but, surprisingly, marked resistance to <z:chebi fb="112" ids="30222">neutrons</z:chebi> relative to progenitors from nonirradiated controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results support the concept that acquired radioresistance of vital granulocyte/monocyte lineage-committed hematopoietic progenitors is temporally, perhaps causally, linked to the processes mediating hematopoietic recovery and accommodation under <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> irradiation, and in turn to preclinical events of evolving <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MPD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In addition, the marked differential responses of progenitors to gamma and neutron irradiation in vitro might suggest differences in the nature of cellular lesions elicited by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> gamma irradiation, in vivo </plain></SENT>
