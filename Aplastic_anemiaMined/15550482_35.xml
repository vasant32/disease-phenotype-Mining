<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Approximately 10% to 15% of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> or other <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> syndromes are carriers of hTERC sequence variants whose functional significance, in most cases, is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We screened 10 reported and 2 newly discovered hTERC variants from such patients and found that 10 of these negatively affected telomerase enzymatic function when they were used to reconstitute telomerase enzymatic function in human cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Most functional deficits were due to perturbations of hTERC secondary structure and correlated well with the degrees of telomere shortening and reduced telomerase activity observed in peripheral blood lymphocytes of the representative patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also found no evidence of dominant-negative activity in any of the mutants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, loss of telomerase activity and of telomere maintenance resulting from inherited hTERC mutations may limit marrow stem cell renewal and predispose some patients to <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
