<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 39-year-old patient with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA), resistant to therapy, received recombinant human IL-3 (rhIL-3) on a phase I/II trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During treatment she developed disseminated <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp>, suggestive of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002633'>vasculitis</z:hpo>, and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0007133'>progressive peripheral neuropathy</z:hpo> culminating in complete <z:hpo ids='HP_0003470'>paralysis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>She died 25 days after beginning treatment from profuse <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On autopsy, evidence of vascular leaks with widespread <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> and extensive hemorrhagic involvement of peripheral nerves was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An additional feature was massive reactive erythrophagocytosis in lymph nodes, spleen and bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The coincidence between rhIL-3 administration and the dramatic events suggest a causal relation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As a possible pathogenic mechanism, an rhIL-3 induced excessive stimulation of macrophages and production of secondary cytokines such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor (TNF) is suggested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>TNF is considered as a major factor in the development of both a vascular leak and reactive erythrophagocytosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This case report can be regarded as an example of the possible unusual pathologic phenomena we may expect to see in the near future with increasing use of growth factors </plain></SENT>
