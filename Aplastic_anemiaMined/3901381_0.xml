<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the data obtained draws attention to the pronounced relative <z:hpo ids='HP_0100827'>lymphocytosis</z:hpo>, disordered balance of the immunoregulatory subpopulations of T lymphocytes (T mu and T gamma) associated with an appreciable increase in the number of cytotoxic T suppressor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The lowering of spontaneous and optimal Con A dose-induced production of leukocyte migration inhibition factor and deficiency of the activity of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> killers can be determined by potentiation of the suppressor activity of T lymphocytes or by the influence of factors produced by T suppressors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The goal-oriented correction of the high suppressor activity of T cells may appear promising in the complex of therapeutic measures used in the management of the patients' population with idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
