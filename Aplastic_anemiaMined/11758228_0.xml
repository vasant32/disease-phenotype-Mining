<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To explore the relationship between thrombopoietin (Tpo) levels and reticulated platelet (RP), blood platelet count (BPC), maturity of megakaryocytes in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001973'>idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura</z:hpo> (CITP), and the prediction evaluation according to Tpo levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Serum level of Tpo was measured by a sandwich-ELISA procedure, RP by flow cytometry after stained with thizole orange (TO), and maturity of megakaryocytes by laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The serum level of Tpo was (204.05 +/- 65.70) ng/L in 23 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls and (345.46 +/- 222.23) ng/L in 33 patients with CITP, being no significant difference between the two groups (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Compared with controls, serum Tpo levels in 22 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>(AA) patients [(1427.62 +/- 468.84) ng/L] and 10 <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) patients [(596.09 +/- 462.95) ng/L] were increased significantly (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The RPC was significantly lower in AA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The RP% was increased significantly in CITP and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Tpo level was higher in CITP patients with no response to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoid</z:chebi> therapy than in those with response (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Serum level of Tpo was not increased in patients with CITP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The RP%, RPC and Tpo levels could reflect thrombocytopoiesis and differentiate the causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The serum level of Tpo could be useful in prediction of the response to therapy in CITP patients </plain></SENT>
