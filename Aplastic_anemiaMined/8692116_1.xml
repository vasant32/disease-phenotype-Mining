<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The conditioning and myeloablative treatment regimens were chosen according to the underlying disease and type of transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The observation period comprises 1 to 115 months after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After allogeneic transplantation from HLA-identical family donors, the probabilities of disease-free survival were for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> in first complete remission (CR) (n = 35) 77%, for <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoid leukemia</z:hpo> in 1st CR (n = 7) 72% and in 2nd CR (n = 10) 40%, in first <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phase of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (n = 34) 50% and in severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (n = 7) 100% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Following myeloablative therapy and autologous transplantation the probabilities of disease-free survival were 47% in relapsed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> (n = 22) and 42% for relapsed high-grade non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eight of 10 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> myeloid and 7 of 8 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoid leukemia</z:hpo> suffered a leukemic relapse after autologous bone marrow transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three of 8 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278841" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">relapsed testicular cancer</z:e> survived relapse-free </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment failures were due to more advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft versus host disease</z:e> after allogeneic transplantation and caused by relapse after autologous transplantation </plain></SENT>
