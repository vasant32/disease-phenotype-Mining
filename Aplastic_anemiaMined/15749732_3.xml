<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In order to explore the relationship between IL-15 and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA), bone marrow (BM) fibroblast-like stromal cells (BMFSCs) were obtained from BM samples of 23 AA patients by density centrifugation and primary culturing in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Indirect immunofluorescence labeling as well as flow cytometry and confocal laser scanning microscopy analysis were used to determine the expression of membrane-bound IL-15 (mIL-15) on the surface of BMFSCs derived from AA patients (AA-BMFSCs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The effects of IFN-gamma and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> (CsA) on the expression of mIL-15 were also investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>[(3)H]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> incorporation test as well as specific antibody inhibition and Transwell separation experiment was adopted to functionally evaluate the expression of mIL-15 on the surface of AA-BMFSCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>mIL-15 was found to be over-expressed on the surface of AA-BMFSCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>IFN-gamma further significantly up-regulated its expression, which, however, was inhibited by CsA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, a tight correlation was found between the expression of mIL-15 and IL-15Ralpha on the surface of AA-BMFSCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>AA-BMFSCs had the capability to stimulate the proliferation of T lymphocytes, which was partly or completely inhibited by using neutralizing anti-IL-15Ralpha antibody, neutralizing anti-IL-15 antibody, blocking anti-IL-2/15Rgamma(c) mAb or Transwell chambers with a 0.3-mum pore size membrane to block the direct cell-to-cell contact between AA-BMFSCs and T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Apparently, BMFSCs as the most important component of BM hematopoietic microenvironment usually over-express mIL-15 in AA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, AA-BMFSCs may indirectly participate in the T cell-mediated destruction of hematopoietic progenitors in AA by recruiting T cells to BM and stimulating them in situ </plain></SENT>
