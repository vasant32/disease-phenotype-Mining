<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> received an ABO incompatible bone marrow transplant (BMT) from an HLA identical sibling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Weekly HLA antibody screens were performed as part of the BMT protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At the time of transplant, a hemolytic anti-Le(a) was detected in the Le (a-b-) donor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Le (a-b+) recipient had no red cell or LCT antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A hemolytic anti-Le(a) was detected in the recipient on day 8, but no LCT reactivity was noted at this time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On day 15, the LCT panel demonstrated reactivity with 9 of 50 panel cells without apparent HLA specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">Graft vs. host disease</z:e> (GVHD) was present on the skin at this time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> was increased, but by day 20 the GVHD worsened and the LCT titers increased to 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This strong reactivity was noted only in the Le (a+) panel members (12/50) and was neutralized with commercial Lewis substance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On day 34 there was no evidence of GVHD, but the lymphocytotoxic anti-Lea continued to be present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The patient began experiencing renal and gastrointestinal difficulties by day 48, and expired on day 60 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In renal transplants the kidneys retain their Lewis type and secrete Lewis substance in the urine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In our experience BMT patients retain their Lewis type regardless of the type of the donor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The Lewis system has been linked to renal allograft rejection, and Lewis antigens may function as transplantation antigens in BMT patients as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In addition, lymphocytotoxic Lewis antibodies can mask other significant HLA antibodies and must be identified when screening patients in need of plateletpheresis products </plain></SENT>
