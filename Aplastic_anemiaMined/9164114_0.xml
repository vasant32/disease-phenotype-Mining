<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four samples of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> marrow from eight control subjects and 19 samples of hyperplastic marrow in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> were examined with a 1.5T <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> unit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The former showed low intensity on opposed-phase T1-weighted images, while the latter showed high intensity on both fast STIR and opposed-phase T1-weighted images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> spectroscopy quantitatively confirmed that the water: fat ratio was increased and the transverse relaxation time of water was changed in hyperplastic bone marrow, compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In summary, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging is able to detect hematopoietic regions among a wide range of bone marrow of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, while <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> spectroscopy allowed us to quantitatively analyze the cell population of hyperplastic hematopoietic marrow in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
