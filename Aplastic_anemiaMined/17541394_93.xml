<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MSCs were given to three patients for graft failure and four patients were included in a pilot study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>HSCT donors were three human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical siblings, three unrelated donors and one cord blood unit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The conditioning was myeloablative in four patients and reduced in three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MSC donors were HLA-identical siblings in three cases and haploidentical in four cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neutrophil counts &gt;0.5 x 10(9)/l was reached at a median of 12 (range 10-28) days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Platelet counts &gt;30 x 10(9)/l was achieved at a median of 12 (8-36) days </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two patients developed grade II, which in one patient evolved into <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One <z:hpo ids='HP_0004430'>severe combined immunodeficiency</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp>) patient died of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004030" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aspergillosis</z:e>, the others are alive and well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One patient, diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> had graft failure after her first transplantation and severe Henoch-Sch√∂nlein <z:hpo ids='HP_0000979'>Purpura</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="24" ids="50430">HSP</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>After retransplantation of MSCs and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSCs</z:chebi>, she recovered from both the <z:chebi fb="24" ids="50430">HSP</z:chebi> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Thus, co-transplantation of MSC resulted in fast engraftment of absolute neutrophil count (ANC) and platelets and 100% donor chimerism, even in three patients regrafted for graft failure/rejection </plain></SENT>
