<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The first group of 20 patients was isolated in a conventional hospital room, while management of the aplastic phase in the second group of 25 patients was performed in a laminar air flow (LAF) unit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received total decontamination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a retrospective analysis the number of positive blood cultures during the neutropenic period was 85% in the first group, as compared with 40% in the second group, and the number of febrile episodes was 85% versus 64%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Despite the fact that the septic morbidity was lower in the LAF group, mortality during the neutropenic period (15% in group I versus 16% in group II) was unaffected and survival rate (45% in group I versus 36% in group II) did not improve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that LAF protection will only have a positive impact on survival rate if the incidence of non-infectious complications of BMT, such as organ toxicity or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e>, is likewise reduced </plain></SENT>
