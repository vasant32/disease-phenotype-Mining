<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>TT virus (TTV) is widespread throughout the world and can be detected in 50-95% of healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> C virus (HCV) infected patients coinfected with TTV, histological activity indices were higher than patients with HCV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There are studies which indicate that TTV can cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>While TTV is known to be transmitted through blood transfusions and by fecal-oral route, published information on transplasental transmission is controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The aims of this study were to detect the frequency of TTV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> among healthy pregnant women and to search whether TTV is transmitted transplasentally during pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For this purpose, plasma samples collected from 54 women and their newborns were investigated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> loads were determined for infected newborns, and their respective mothers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Also, ten mothers whose newborns were tested negative for TTV-DNA were enrolled in <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> load tests for comparison </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>TTV-DNA was detected in 49 (90.7%) of 54 women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of 49 newborns whose mothers were infected with TTV, only 4 (8.2%) were found positive for TTV-DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no statistically significant difference in TTV-DNA loads between mothers who transmitted the virus and those who did not (Mann-Whitney U analysis Z=-0.071, P=0.944) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>As a result, transplasental transmission of TTV is possible but occurs in low frequency and independent of <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> load </plain></SENT>
