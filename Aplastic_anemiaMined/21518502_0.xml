<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study was aimed to explore whether the perforin gene 1 (PRF1) mutation is the basis of genetic susceptibility to pathogenesis of acquired severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (SAA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DNA exon2 and exon3 of PRF1 gene in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in 31 SAA patients and 15 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls were amplified by PCR; the sequencing was performed by using ABI pRISM 373OXL sequencer; the mutation loci were sought through checking sequences with GenBank-reported sequences; after the mutation sequences were found, those were cloned into M13 phage vector, then the corresponding sequences of gained 2 chromosomes were sequenced respectively to determine the distribution of different mutations on chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results showed that (1) one homozygous mutation (822 C &gt; T, synonymous mutation) and one heterozygous mutation (907 G &gt; A, methionine 303 valine) were found in PRF1 coding region of 2 SAA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These mutations were not detected in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>(2) 1 SNP (rs885822) in the coding region was detected in SAA patients and controls, and the heterozygosity rate between the 2 groups was different (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that perforin gene mutation may be one risk factor in the aberrant proliferation and activation of cytotoxic T cells in pathogenesis of a part of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
