<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Hepatosplenic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026946" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fungal infection</z:e> (HSF) is a distinct form of invasive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026946" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fungal infection</z:e> with main involvement of the liver, spleen, and occasionally the kidney </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with HSF in childhood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed pediatric patients with the diagnosis of HSF in a tertiary medical center in Taiwan between July 1999 and June 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The definition of HSF included imaging studies demonstrating multiple focal lesions in the liver and/or spleen with or without a microbiologic evidence for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026946" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fungal infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The clinical characteristics and outcomes were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified 15 pediatric patients with HSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients had diagnosis of hemato-oncologic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e>, and two patients had severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, and most patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001433'>hepatosplenomegaly</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The detection rate of computed tomography scan (15/15, 100%) was superior to abdominal sonography (10/15, 67%, p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ten (91%) of the 11 patients with microbiologic evidence were infected by Candida species </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Neither recurrence nor breakthrough <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026946" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fungal infection</z:e> was noted when the patients underwent further chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Six patients (40%) died before the end of the study, but no mortality was directly related to HSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Candida species was the major pathogen for HSF, and computed tomography scan was a good diagnostic tool to detect the multiple focal lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Under adequate antifungal treatment, HSF could be cured without recurrence in spite of further chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation </plain></SENT>
