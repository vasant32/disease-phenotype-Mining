<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To set up the experimental conditions to induce aplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> in rats by oral and subcutaneous administration of <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: 6 groups with 6 male Wistar rats weighting 150 g each were formed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Each group with different conditions; 3 of them as experimental groups: 1) ES group (<z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> 2 mL/Kg supplied subcutaneously), 2) EOI and 3) EOII groups (<z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> 1.14 and 2 mL/Kg supplied orally); and 3 groups as control: 4) TS and 5) TO groups (supplied only with the vehicle subcutaneously. and orally, respectively) and 6) C group without treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">Benzene</z:chebi> was supplied during four weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Blood counts were done at 0, 15 and 30 days of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>EOI and EOII treatment was interrupted because of a severe damage to rats and the other groups except TO group continued until 60 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When the treatment ended haematological determinations continued for 60 days every two weeks including osmotic fragility test and bone marrow smears in order to observe permanent changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The rats treated with <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> 4 weeks showed a reduction in concentration of <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> of nasal and gastric mucosae, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0002813'>microcytosis</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0000248'>macrocytosis</z:mp> in EOI and EOII groups respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The animals treated with <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> 60 days (ES) showed persistent reduction in <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> and platelet concentration, <z:mp ids='MP_0000248'>macrocytosis</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001888'>lymphopenia</z:hpo> until day 60 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the neutrophil concentration kept lower than the controls after day 75 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In these animals blast cells and increased peroxidase positive cells were seen in peripheral blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Also an increased osmotic fragility of erythrocytes was observed and the bone marrow exhibited deep hypocellularity until day 120 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The administration of <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> subcutaneously damaged irreversibly the myeloid progenitor cells, causing permanent reduction in concentration of erythrocytes, platelets and neutrophils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>These results are similar to those reported with the inhalatory exposition to <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>With the method here assayed long periods of treatment and expensive and sophisticated experimental conditions are avoided </plain></SENT>
