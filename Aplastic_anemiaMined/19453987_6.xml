<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221123" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Hemolytic transfusion reactions</z:e> (HTRs) can occur with transfusion of platelets (PLTs) containing ABO-incompatible plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Reported cases have involved group O donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two cases of PLT-mediated HTRs associated with the same group A plateletpheresis component, collected from a donor taking high doses of probiotics are reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: Case 1 was a 40-year-old 69-kg group B stem cell transplant patient who received one-half of a group A plateletpheresis component </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0003418'>back pain</z:hpo> occurred 10 minutes into the transfusion, accompanied by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Case 2 was a 5-year-old 26-kg group B male with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> who received the other half of the same plateletpheresis component, volume reduced to 37 mL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001279'>Syncope</z:hpo> occurred immediately after the transfusion, with laboratory evidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0010163'>hemolysis</z:mp> a few hours later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Serologic investigation of posttransfusion samples from both patients revealed positive direct antiglobulin tests: C3d only for Case 1 and immunoglobulin (Ig)G and C3d for Case 2; the eluates contained anti-B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The group A donor's anti-B titer was 16,384 at saline and IgG phases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Donor lookback revealed that the donor had donated 134 apheresis PLTs over many years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For 3 years, he had intermittently taken probiotics; 3 weeks before the index donation, he began taking three tablets of probiotics every day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Lookback of prior group B recipients uncovered a case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0010163'>hemolysis</z:mp> that was not recognized at the time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The solubilized probiotic inhibited anti-B in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Non-group O PLT donors can have high-titer anti-A or anti-B that might mediate HTRs, and probiotic ingestion in blood donors represents a novel mechanism of stimulating high-titer anti-B </plain></SENT>
