<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe two children affected by severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, not responsive to immunosuppressive therapy, who underwent allogeneic bone marrow transplantation using a HLA-partially matched family donor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both cases presented 2 first class HLA-antigens (A and B) disparity between donor and recipient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The pretransplant conditioning regimen consisted of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, thoracoabdominal irradiation, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="22601">arabinoside</z:chebi>, and antilymphocyte globulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft versus host disease</z:e> (GVHD) prophylaxis, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">Cyclosporine</z:chebi>-A was administered at usual dosages for 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A full marrow engraftment was observed in both cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only grade I <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD, promptly responsive to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> therapy, developed with no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Five months after transplant, both children progressively developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, renal function impairment, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001895'>normochromic anemia</z:hpo>, with erythropoietin serum levels lower than expected for the haematocrit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After antihypertension treatment and supportive therapy, the clinical picture progressively improved, while treatment with recombinant human erythropoietin completely corrected the long-lasting <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The two children are alive and well 28 months after the transplant, with a Karnofsky score of 100% and a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> peripheral blood count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The authors suggest that, once immunosuppressive therapy has failed, BMT from donors other than HLA-identical sibling is a feasible approach in children affected by severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, not having an HLA-identical donor </plain></SENT>
