<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We compared the effects of CAP and its <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35801">nitroso</z:chebi> derivative on DNA synthesis, CFU-C growth, and cell viability in human bone marrow and on mouse CFU-S viability in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As previously reported from this laboratory, CAP inhibited DNA synthesis only when used in high concentrations (greater than 3 x 10(-4)M), and the inhibition was largely reversible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It also caused a reversible concentration-dependent inhibition of CFU-C growth but did not affect marrow cell viability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In sharp contrast, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35801">nitroso</z:chebi>-CAP inhibited DNA synthesis in much lower concentrations and caused irreversible inhibition of CFU-C growth and cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> at 5 x 10(-5)M as well as irreversible mouse CFU-S damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a rapidly growing human lymphoid cell line, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35801">nitroso</z:chebi>-CAP caused accumulation of cells in the G2M phase and increasing cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> within the arrested population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We have postulated from these and other observations that CAP-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> occurs in the predisposed host who provides the milieu for the transformation of the p-<z:chebi fb="4" ids="16301,29423,29424,29785,29786,33101">NO2</z:chebi> group of the drug to toxic intermediates </plain></SENT>
