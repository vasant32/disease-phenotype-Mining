<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The potent inhibiting activity was demonstrated in six of 20 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Five of the six patients were severe AA (SAA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The suppressive effect did not change after elimination of monocyles and lymphocytes from target MNC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The haematopoietic inhibitory activity of sera from three of the six patients was almost totally neutralized by the MoAb against gamma-IFN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> these three patients were SAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that inhibitor of haematopoietic progenitor cells is present in most of SAA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In some patients, the inhibitor was gamma-IFN, which play an important role in the pathogenesis of SAA </plain></SENT>
