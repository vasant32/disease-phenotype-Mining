<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> involves an acquired mutation in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001417'>X-linked</z:hpo> PIG-A gene, which leads to incomplete bioassembly of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24410">glycosylphosphatidylinositol</z:chebi> (GPI) anchors and absent or reduced surface expression of GPI-linked proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The origin and mechanisms by which the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> clone becomes dominant are not well understood, but recently resistance to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> has been postulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To test the hypothesis that the PIG-A mutation and absence of GPI-linked surface proteins directly confer resistance to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, we isolated peripheral granulocytes from 26 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> and 20 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls and measured <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induced by serum starvation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Granulocytes from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> were relatively resistant to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> (38.8% +/- 14.1%) as compared with granulocytes from controls (55.0% +/- 12.0%, P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, this resistance to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was not related to the dominance of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> clone because patients with a low percentage of GPI-deficient granulocytes had a similar rate of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> as those with a high percentage of GPI-deficient granulocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similarly, the resistance to granulocyte <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was not influenced by the degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> or a prior history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To investigate formally the importance of GPI-linked surface proteins in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, we introduced the PIG-A cDNA sequence into the JY5 GPI-negative B-lymphoblastoid cell line using two different methods: (1) stable transfection of a plasmid containing PIG-A, and (2) stable transduction of a retroviral vector containing PIG-A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We then measured rates of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induced either by Fas antibody, serum starvation, or gamma-irradiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>With each stimulus, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of JY5 with stable surface expression of GPI-linked proteins was not statistically different from the parent JY5 cell line or the JY25 (GPI-positive) cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our data confirm that granulocytes from patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> have a relative resistance to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> as compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> granulocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, this resistance does not vary with the level of expression of GPI-linked proteins, and stable introduction of PIG-A cDNA with correction of GPI-linked surface expression does not change the rate of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Taken together, our data do not support the hypothesis that the PIG-A mutation and absence of GPI-linked surface proteins directly confer resistance to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the resistance to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> is not related to the PIG-A mutation, indicating that other factors must be important in the origin of this phenomenon and the clonal dominance observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
