<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To explore the effects of infusion with human mesenchymal stem cells from bone marrow on bone marrow hematopoietic function and survival in mice with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA), immuno-mediated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> mice model was established according to Yao's method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirty BALB/c female mice were divided into AA model group, MSC group and radiation group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In MSC group, 1 x 10(6) MSC was infused by intravenous injection at 3 days after establishment of model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The changes of blood count, the number of nuclear cells in a single thigh-bone, colony-forming units (CFU), pathological features of bone marrow and survival rate of mice were observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the number of white blood cells in peripheral blood of AA model group at day 7 after establishment of model was (0.65 +/- 0.05) x 10(9)/L, which was significantly lower than those in MSC group and radiation alone group, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>Pancytopenia</z:hpo> was found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three groups at day 10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At day 14 the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> was continued in AA model group while it was less severe in MSC and radiation groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In MSC group the number of nucleated cells in single thigh bone and pathological slice as well as CFU-GM were significantly higher than those in AA model group, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The survival rate of mice in MSC group was 80.0% which was higher than that of group in AA model (18.2%, p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences between MSC group and radiation alone group in bone marrow hematopoiesis and survival rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that MSC infusion reduces the degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> and improve survival of immuno-mediated AA mice model </plain></SENT>
