<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although nonmyeloablative is favored over myeloablative transplantation for many patients, graft rejection remains problematic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One strategy to decrease rejection is to protect donor activated T cells in the graft from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> (MTX) by genetically modifying the cells to express MTX-resistant <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23743">dihydrofolate</z:chebi> reductase (Tyr22-DHFR), leaving the immunosuppressive effects of MTX to act solely on activated host T lymphocytes, shifting the balance to favor allogeneic engraftment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To evaluate MTX resistance of Tyr22-DHFR(+) T lymphocytes in vivo, we transplanted dogs with autologous CD34(+) cells modified with YFP and DHFR-GFP lentivirus vectors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Dogs were then treated with a standard MTX regimen (days 1, 3, 6, and 11) following immune activation with a foreign antigen as a surrogate assay to mimic early transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: DHFR-GFP(+) gene marking was maintained in CD3(+) CD25(+) and CD4(+) T lymphocytes after MTX treatment while the level of T lymphocytes that expressed only a fluorescent reporter (YFP(+) ) decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data show that Tyr22-DHFR expression protects T lymphocytes from MTX toxicity in dogs, highlighting a clinically relevant application for preserving donor T lymphocytes during post transplantation immunosuppression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings have implications for clinical translation of MTX-resistant T cells to facilitate engraftment of allogeneic cells following nonmyeloablative conditioning and minimize the risk of rejection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In summary, Tyr22-DHFR expression in T lymphocytes provides chemoprotection from MTX-mediated elimination in the context of immune activation in vivo </plain></SENT>
