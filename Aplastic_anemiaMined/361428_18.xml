<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A stem cell lesion caused by a toxin, virus or microenvironment defect is the main hypothesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An autoimmune origin has been recently suspected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In an attempt to demonstrate the autoimmune origin of the disease, 17 patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> were treated with antilymphocyte globulin (ALG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nine patients showed no improvement, developed infectious or hemorrhagic complications and died within 1 to 7 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, eight patients had a prompt rise of granulocyte and reticulocyte counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although the hematological reconstitution is not complete, these eight patients are still alive between 11 months and 24 months after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study shows that ALG may have a beneficial effect in the treatment of patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
