<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although a Th1-mediated pathology is well described for AA, molecular mechanisms driving disease progression remain ill defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The NOTCH signaling pathway mediates Th1 cell differentiation in the presence of polarizing cytokines, an action requiring enzymatic processing of NOTCH receptors by γ-secretase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using a mouse model of AA, we demonstrate that expression of both intracellular NOTCH1(IC) and T-BET, a key transcription factor regulating Th1 cell differentiation, was increased in spleen and BM-infiltrating T cells during active disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Conditionally deleting Notch1 or administering γ-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) in vivo attenuated disease and rescued mice from lethal BMF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In peripheral T cells from patients with untreated AA, NOTCH1(IC) was significantly elevated and bound to the TBX21 promoter, showing NOTCH1 directly regulates the gene encoding T-BET </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treating patient cells with GSIs in vitro lowered NOTCH1(IC) levels, decreased NOTCH1 detectable at the TBX21 promoter, and decreased T-BET expression, indicating that NOTCH1 signaling is responsive to GSIs during active disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Collectively, these results identify NOTCH signaling as a primary driver of Th1-mediated pathogenesis in AA and may represent a novel target for therapeutic intervention </plain></SENT>
