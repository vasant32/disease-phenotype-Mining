<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The treatment of this disease consists of supportive therapy with blood products and finally phase, where there are two possibilities: immunosuppression and bone marrow transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunosuppression means the use of antilymphocyte or antithymocyte globulins, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1456831" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">anabolic steroids</z:e>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">Cyclosporine</z:chebi> A, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi>, and recently haemopoietic growth factors [1] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The advantage of bone marrow transplantation compared to other kinds of treatment has been established in multicentric trials [2] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Goals of study: 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To show and analyze clinical characteristics in patients with aplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo>; 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To study survival according to gender, age and kinds of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty three patients with aplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> are included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>They were treated at the Institute of Haematology, Clinical Centre of Serbia, from 1988 to 1995 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For description of data we used parameters for the arithmetic mean and standard deviation; for nonparametric tests-median </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Student's T-test was used for comparison of differences among the mean values from nonparametric analytic models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>From nonparametric models, Fisher's test was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>For data analysis of survival Kaplan-Mayer's model was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty three patients with aplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>There were 17 (52%) men and 16 (48%) women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The youngest patient was 15 and the oldest 73 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The average age of patients was 40.18 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>In the group up to 30 years there were 16 (48%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>In the group from 31 to 45 years there were 4 (12%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>In the group from 46 to 60 years there were 4 (12%) patients, and in the group from 61 to 75 years 9 (28%); clinical signs (<z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp>, exhaustion) and anaemic signs (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000980'>pallor</z:hpo>) were present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients (33) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>In 12 (36%) patients high body temperature was established and in 21 (64%) patients there was no temperature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Signs of haemorrhagic syndrome were established in 26 (79%) patients and 7 (21%) patients had no such signs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>No significant statistical difference in survival (Lee-Desu = 0.071; DF = 1; p = 0.789) related to sex, was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>According to the duration of the disease by year, and over this period, the difference was statically very significant (Lee-Desu = 20.735; DF = 1; p = 0.000) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Therefore, in patients with a longer duration of the disease than one year the chance for a longer survival is better </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>We compared the group of patients treated with antilymphocytic globulin with the group treated with other methods (androgenic hormones and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">Prednisolone</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">Cyclosporine</z:chebi> A and bone marrow transplantation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Between these two groups the difference was statistically significant (Lee-Desu = 2.742; DF = 1; p = 0.018) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>Therefore, survival of patients of the second group was longer thanks to a successful bone marrow transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>The group of patients treated by bone marrow transplantation was compared with the group of patients treated with other three methods; the difference was statistically significant (Lee-Desu = 7.346; DF = 1; p = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>The best method of treatment is bone marrow transplantation in comparison to the other three methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>Survival was also analyzed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four studied age groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>No statistically significant difference was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Aplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> is a serious, relatively rare illness, appearing with almost equal frequency in men and women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>Two peaks were noticed: in the younger age group up to 30 years (48%) and over 60 years (27%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>According to survival, there was a group with short survival, up to 12 months, and a group with longer survival, over 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Gender and age had no influence on duration of survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>Only the duration of the disease had a positive effect on survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>In comparison to other methods, the most efficacious treatment was allogenic bone marrow transplantation </plain></SENT>
