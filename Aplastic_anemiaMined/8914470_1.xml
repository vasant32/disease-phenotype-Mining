<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Even when left ventricular contractility and pump function were within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range, its afterload had a tendency to increase in transfusion-dependent patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients who had impairment of cardiac pump function died of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>congestive heart failure</z:hpo> within one year after abnormal findings in stress-velocity relation were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the stress-velocity relation is a sensitive, useful and noninvasive index for detecting asymptomatic myocardial dysfunction in patients with transfusion-dependency and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is necessary for these patients to undergo examinations of echocardiography at regular intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In case of abnormally in the stress-velocity relation, treatment for afterload mismatch and more effective chelation should be recommended to reduce the burden on the heart </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thereby, the heart is kept in better condition and the prognosis of these patients will be improved </plain></SENT>
