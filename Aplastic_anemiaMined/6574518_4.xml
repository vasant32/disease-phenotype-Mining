<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Significant in vivo stimulation of granulopoiesis was induced in mice by the administration of an extract from the urine of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="26667">Sialic acid</z:chebi> has been identified as an important molecular component for the in vivo biological activity of this granulopoietic factor, "granulopoietin," which is distinct and different from endotoxin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Urine from patients with AA was successively fractionated by Sephadex G-50 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52153">DEAE</z:chebi>-cellulose chromatography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The resultant extract, which we refer to as AA urinary extract, contained approximately equal to 44 international units of erythropoietin per A unit of protein and induced 15,000 colonies of granulocyte/macrophage precursor cells (granulocyte/macrophage colony-forming units, CFU-gm) per A unit of protein with mouse bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eight daily intraperitoneal injections of this extract in mice induced a 6.2-fold increase in peripheral blood granulocytes and a 14.6-fold increase of splenic CFU-gm, with concomitant increases in the proliferation rates of CFU-gm in both bone marrow and spleen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment of the AA urinary extract with sialidase significantly diminished these granulopoietic effects in vivo (P less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, both extracts (i.e., native AA and sialidase-treated AA urinary extracts) revealed high granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor activity in vitro when clonal assays were performed with mouse bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Increased in vivo and in vitro granulopoietic activities were found in the concanavalin A "break-through" fraction, indicating that these activities were due to protein(s) that did not bind to the lectin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results reveal that this urinary extract from patients with AA is capable of inducing significant granulopoiesis in mice and that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26667">sialic acid</z:chebi> is an important component in the maintenance of this granulopoietic effect in vivo but not in vitro </plain></SENT>
