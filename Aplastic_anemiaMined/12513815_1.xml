<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The result showed that the diagnostic rates of bone marrow imprint and biopsy were both significantly higher than bone marrow smear, especially in the cases with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011974'>myelofibrosis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and metastatic <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> in bone marrow (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference between bone marrow imprint and biopsy, however the bone marrow imprint observed more clearly and more simple and convenient than the bone marrow biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that bone marrow imprint is important for diagnosing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
