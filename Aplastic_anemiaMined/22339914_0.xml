<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> A (CsA) whole-blood concentration on the early response to immunosuppressive therapy (IST) in severe and very severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (SAA/VSAA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ninety SAA/VSAA patients treated with rabbit antithymocyte globulin (ATG) plus CsA as first line therapy in our hospital were retrospectively analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CsA levels between the response group and non-response group, and response rates of patients with variant CsA levels were compared respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: (1) There was no significant difference in the beginning unmodified CsA blood concentration between IST responded and non-responded SAA/VSAA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The beginning unmodified C(0) 133.91 ug/L in IST 2-month responders was higher than that of 49.9 ug/L in non-responded SAA patients (P = 0.009); (2) The mean CsA C(0) and C(2) levels during the third month following IST were significantly different in responders and non-responders(197.52 µg/L vs 161.49 µg/L, P = 0.024, and 738.76 µg/L vs 615.46 µg/L, P = 0.009), and no significant difference in other periods of IST (P &gt; 0.05); (3) The response rate (87.5%) was significantly higher in patients with CsA C(0) ≥ 200µg/L the third month following IST than those of 55.6% in patients with CsA C(0) 150 - 200 µg/L (P = 0.023) and 59.3% in patients with CsA C(0) &lt; 150 µg/L (P = 0.046), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The response rate was significantly higher of C(2) ≥ 700 µg/L group than that of C(2) &lt; 700 µg/L group (80.5%vs 55.3%, P = 0.012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The CsA concentration related to the early IST response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The third month CsA concentrations was the most important for the response and maintaining CsA levels with C(0) ≥ 200 µg/L and C(2) ≥ 700 µg/L may improve the response to IST in SAA/VSAA </plain></SENT>
