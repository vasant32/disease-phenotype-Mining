<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>An immunologic crossreactant of erythropoietin seemed to develop and persist in serum samples from a patient during treatment and remission of idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It had a steeper slope to radioimmunoassay log-dose response lines and a larger molecular size than erythropoietin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On fractionation of serum, the apparent crossreactant was bound by staphylococcal Protein A at pH 7.5 and recovered by elution from it at pH 3.0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Adsorption of serum from the patient, and from one of two similarly affected children, with rabbit IgG linked to <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2511">agarose</z:chebi> appeared to remove completely the apparent crossreactant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These treated sera gave radioimmunoassay log-dose response lines essentially parallel to that given by the International Reference Preparation (IRP) for erythropoietin and estimates of immunoreactive erythropoietin appropriate to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The apparent crossreactant of erythropoietin is thus accounted for by heterophilic antibodies to rabbit IgG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These developed in the patient following treatment with rabbit antilymphocyte globulin but seem to have arisen spontaneously in the children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus iatrogenic and idiopathic antibodies to rabbit IgG interfered in a radioimmunoassay for erythropoietin in serum through their ability to react with the radioimmunoassay anti-erythropoietin antiserum raised in rabbits </plain></SENT>
