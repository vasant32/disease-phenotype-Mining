<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The prognosis for AA with EF has generally been poor, but a few reports suggest a role for immunosuppressive therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have seen four cases of AA complicating EF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> and anti-thymocyte globulin without any benefit </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The second transplanted patient appears to be the only reported case of long term cure of both the AA and EF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our four patients constitute the largest reported series of AA with EF and shed light on clinical aspects of the disease, and on the pathogenesis, particularly on responsiveness to different therapies; furthermore, there are implications to the treatment of AA in general </plain></SENT>
