<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 30-year-old man was diagnosed with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> in 1997 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>He received mPSL pulse therapy and was treated with ATG and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi>, resulting in remission and exacerbation; however, his <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> gradually progressed and transfusions were required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>He was referred to our hospital for further treatment by allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (allo-BMT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Before allo-BMT, he suffered febrile <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>His white blood cell count was &lt;100/microl despite daily administration of G-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although we detected asymptomatic stones in his gallbladder (GB) and common bile duct (CBD) by a screening test before allo-BMT, we decided to remove the stones after BMT because of his severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>He underwent allo-BMT from an HLA-matched unrelated donor after conditioning with a reduced-intensity regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On day 9 after BMT, he developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> obstructive suppurative <z:mp ids='MP_0003254'>cholangitis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Germ-free care was transiently stopped and endoscopic biliary drainage (EBD) was performed for the stones in the common bile duct </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Engraftment of WBC was confirmed on day 24, and the stones were removed using endoscopic sphincterotomy on day 57 after confirmation of platelet recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We could perform EBD safely before hematological engraftment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A strategy for the management of asymptomatic stones of the GB and CBD has not yet been established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The possibility of removing stones before BMT should therefore be considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Consideration should also be given to the possibility of improving <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> obstructive suppurative <z:mp ids='MP_0003254'>cholangitis</z:mp> by EBD and antibiotics before hematological engraftment in such cases when stones cannot be removed before BMT </plain></SENT>
