<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mean growth velocity, expressed as a standard deviation score, for the children who underwent bone marrow transplantation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0003006'>neuroblastoma</z:hpo> was -2.83 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This was significantly (p less than 0.005) less than the standard deviation scores for children with transplants for <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> nonlymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, which were -0.98, -0.07, and -1.05, respectively </plain></SENT>
