<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To determine the levels of T-lymphocyte subset, serum <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-2 (IL-2) in CAA patients before and after treatment, and to analyse the regulation of their changes comparatively with the group treated with conventional treatment and a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Before treatment, CD4 was lower, CD8 higher, CD4/CD8 ratio also lower, TNF-alpha and IL-2 were higher in the ZZD treated group than those in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control group, with significant difference (P &lt; 0.05), but after ZZD treatment, these indexes were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> inversely changed, as compared with those before treatment and with those in the control group, the difference was significant (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: ZZD might relieve the hemopoietic inhibition so as to promote the recovery of hemopoietic function through improving the T-lymphocyte subset and reducing the release of hemopoietic negative ragulatory factors such as TNF-alpha and IL-2 etc </plain></SENT>
