<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The model of immune <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> mice was induced by means of 6.0 Gy60Co gamma-ray irradiation and lymphocyte infusion through tail vein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mice were divided into 3 groups: the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> group, the AA control group and the ligustrazine group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mice of the ligustrazine group were fed by 4 mg of ligustrazine injection twice a day by gastrogavage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the 10th day, CD34 antigen expression intensity of bone marrow cell membrane was measured by flow cytometer analysis system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CD34 antigen expression intensity of ligustrazine group was 77.6 +/- 6.5, with no statistic difference from that in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> group (80.0 +/- 2.6), while that of the control group was much higher (68.6 +/- 4.5, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Ligustrazine could promote proliferation of stem and progenitor cell of AA mice through influencing on bone marrow micro-environment so as to increase the CD34 antigen expression of bone marrow cells </plain></SENT>
