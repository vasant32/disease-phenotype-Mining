<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report one case of colonic EBV-LPD after a single course of immunosuppressive therapy for AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patient developed multiple <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009375" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colonic tumors</z:e> 3 months after receiving immunosuppressive therapy, which consisted of rabbit antithymocyte globulin (ATG), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>-predonisolone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The histological findings of biopsy specimens revealed that atypical lymphocytes had infiltrated colonic glands </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical staining for CD20 was positive, and in situ hybridization for EBV-encoded small <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> was also positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The EBV <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> load in peripheral blood was slightly increased to 140/10(6) white blood cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After the cessation of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressant</z:chebi>, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009375" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colonic tumors</z:e> spontaneously regressed, and the EBV <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> load decreased to undetectable levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This is the first report of the single use of rabbit ATG inducing colonic EBV-LPD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Because a single use of immunosuppressive therapy containing rabbit ATG can cause EBV-LPD, we should carefully observe patients receiving rabbit ATG for AA </plain></SENT>
