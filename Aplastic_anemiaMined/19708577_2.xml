<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: We obtained MSC cultures from BM cells of donors and AA patients and induced differentiation of mesenchymal cells with use of relevant reagents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Morphological changes in MSC were studied with light microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A relative level of expression of differentiation marker genes in MSC cultures before and after induction of differentiation was analysed with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: By morphological characteristics, MSC cultures in AA patients before and after differentiation induction do not differ from donor cultures, but relative expression of the genes of differentiation markers demonstrated that expression was different in male and female donors; MSC before and after induction of differentiation differ in donors and AA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Further studies are needed for detection of functional changes in precursors of stromal microenvironment and understanding of the disease pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
