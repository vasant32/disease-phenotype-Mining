<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>By using Dexter-type long-term marrow cultures (D-LTMC), it has been shown previously that hematopoietic progenitor cells (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HPC</z:e>) from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) have a deficient proliferation in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The studies reported to date, however, have focused exclusively on granulomonocytic progenitors and no information exists on erythroid or multipotent progenitor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, in such studies, the input progenitor cell numbers were significantly below <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels, thus suggesting that the rapid disappearance of myeloid progenitor cells from AA D-LTMC could also be due, at least in part, to their reduced number at culture <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we have followed the kinetics of myeloid, erythroid, and multipotent progenitors, from 24 AA patients subjected to immunosuppressive therapy (including patients that achieved complete, partial, or no remission at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>), throughout a seven-week culture period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For analysis, we grouped <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients based on their initial content of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three types of progenitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, we were able to evaluate separately the kinetics of these cells in D-LTMC from patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and subnormal levels of progenitor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At the time of marrow sampling, most patients showed decreased levels of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HPC</z:e>; in fact, only 21%, 8%, and 16% of them showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels of myeloid, erythroid, and multipotent progenitors, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When cultured in D-LTMC, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HPC</z:e> from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> AA patients analyzed showed a relatively fast disappearance from the cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Indeed, myeloid progenitors could be detected for only six weeks, whereas erythroid and multipotent progenitors disappeared from the cultures after two and one weeks of culture, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> marrow D-LTMC, myeloid, erythroid, and multipotent progenitors were detected for at least seven, five, and three weeks, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Such a deficient proliferation was observed even in cultures of AA patients that contained <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HPC</z:e> at culture <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, no correlation was found between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HPC</z:e> proliferation in D-LTMC and response to treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Thus, the results of this study indicate the presence of a functional in vitro deficiency in the hematopoietic system of patients with AA, including those that achieved partial or complete remission after immunosuppressive treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, this work suggests that such a proliferation deficiency is more pronounced in erythroid and multipotent progenitors than in their myeloid counterparts </plain></SENT>
