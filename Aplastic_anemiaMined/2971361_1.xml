<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> in Thailand was studied by using in vitro progenitor cells culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 37 patients who had active disease, the numbers of colonies derived from erythroid and granulocyte-macrophage progenitor cells (BFU-E and CFU-GM) were markedly decreased both in the blood and bone marrow as compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Co-culture of patients' cells with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> blood cells was performed in order to verify an immunologically mediated mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 8 of 26 patients, there were very low numbers of colonies both BFU-E and CFU-GM in the blood and bone marrow with significant suppression of colony formation in co-culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Suppressor cells may have caused the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The rest had low colony formation and no suppression in co-culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These patients may have absent or defective stem cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>None had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colony formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> in Thailand may result mostly from defects involving the stem cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Only some patients had cell mediated suppression of hematopoiesis as detected by co-culture </plain></SENT>
