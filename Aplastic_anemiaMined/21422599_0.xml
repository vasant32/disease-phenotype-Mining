<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the effects of blood lead level on <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> parameters in children suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seventeen children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> disease (15 male and 2 female, age 3-12 y) were recruited in the study group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fifty one healthy children (45 male and 6 female, age 3-12 y) having <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> blood profiles and not suffering from any <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> disease(s) were used as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Blood lead level and <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> parameters were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mean blood lead level was significantly higher while δ-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17549">aminolevulinic acid</z:chebi> dehydratase (δ-ALAD) activity, a biomarker for lead exposure was significantly lower in the study group as compared to the control group (p &lt; 0.05 for each) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Activity of the <z:chebi fb="11" ids="22586">antioxidant</z:chebi> enzyme catalase (CAT) was significantly higher in the study group than in the control group (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was a significant negative correlation of blood lead levels with δ-ALAD (r = -0.45; p &lt; 0.05) and GSH (r = -0.32; p &lt; 0.05), and a positive correlation with TBARS (r = 0.41; p &lt; 0.05) and CAT (r = 0.37; p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
