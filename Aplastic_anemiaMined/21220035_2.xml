<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively compared the outcomes of 225 patients with adult acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT) from matched related donors (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRDs</z:e>), and those treated by alloHSCT from alternative donors (ADs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Univariate and multivariate analyses of factors associated with survival were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed that age at alloHSCT of ≤ 31 years, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e>, successful engraftment, absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (aGVHD), and platelet engraftment at ≤ 21 days, were independent predictors of longer survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, time to aGVHD and cumulative nonrelapse mortality (NRM) were better in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> than in AD recipients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using propensity score matching (PSM), we performed a case-control study comparing 25 patients in each group who underwent alloHSCT from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRDs</z:e> and ADs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pretransplantation clinical factors were well balanced in either group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median survival time was similar, and no statistically significant difference in transplantation outcomes was apparent when <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> and AD recipients were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our results suggest that alloHSCT from an AD should be considered earlier in adult patients with AA who do not have an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
