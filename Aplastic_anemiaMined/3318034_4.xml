<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Lymphoid cell engraftment was monitored for several years after bone marrow transplantation by Y-chromatin staining of T and B lymphocytes in the peripheral blood and/or by immunoglobulin allotyping in the serum of 20 of 52 pediatric patients grafted successively between October 1973 and October 1983 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Data on 2 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004430'>severe combined immunodeficiency</z:hpo>, grafted earlier in December 1968 and April 1971, are also included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These children received an allogeneic bone marrow graft for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (n = 7), severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (n = 11), or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004430'>severe combined immunodeficiency</z:hpo> (n = 4) and were informative for this study, because they differed from their donor by sex (n = 16) and/or by immunoglobulin phenotype (n = 13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of 16 pairs in which the donor was of the opposite sex, 11 patients ultimately showed circulating T and B lymphocytes of donor origin after bone marrow transplantation; in the remaining 5, there was an incomplete chimerism of the circulating lymphoid cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of 13 pairs with a difference in immunoglobulin phenotype between donor and recipient, 8 patients exhibited donor allotypes 3 months or later after transplantation, in 3 of them together with recipient allotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the remaining 5 patients, recipient allotypes were detected after transplantation, but the simultaneous presence of donor-type immunoglobulin production could not be excluded in 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The persistence of either a split (T lineage of donor origin and B lineage of recipient origin) or mixed (T and/or B lineage of donor and recipient origin) chimerism was related to the type of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 3 children circulating B cells of donor-origin did not fit with the recipient origin of the sessile immunoglobulin-secreting plasma cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This implies that different immune compartments--e.g., bone marrow and peripheral lymphoid tissues--should be investigated following allogeneic bone marrow transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A prolonged presence of recipient-type lymphoid cells increased the risk of leukemic relapse in the patients investigated </plain></SENT>
