<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Mutations in TERC, the gene for the <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> component of telomerase, cause short telomeres in congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and in some cases of apparently acquired hematopoietic failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether mutations in genes for other components of telomerase also occur in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We screened blood or marrow cells from 124 patients with apparently acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and 282 control subjects for sequence variations in the TERT, DKC1, NHP2, and NOP10 genes; an additional 81 patients and 246 controls were examined for genetic variations in TERT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Telomere lengths and the telomerase activity of peripheral-blood leukocytes were evaluated in patients carrying genetic variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Identified mutations were transfected into telomerase-deficient cell lines to examine their effects and their mechanism of action on telomerase function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Five heterozygous, nonsynonymous mutations (which cause an amino acid change in the corresponding protein) were identified in TERT, the gene for the telomerase reverse transcriptase catalytic enzyme, among seven unrelated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Leukocytes from these patients had short telomeres and low telomerase enzymatic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In three of these patients, the mutation was also detected in buccal mucosa cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Family members carrying the mutations also had short telomeres and reduced telomerase activity but no evident hematologic abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results of coexpression of <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> TERT and TERT with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>-associated mutations in a telomerase-deficient cell line suggested that haploinsufficiency was the mechanism of telomere shortening due to TERT mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Heterozygous mutations in the TERT gene impair telomerase activity by haploinsufficiency and may be risk factors for marrow failure </plain></SENT>
