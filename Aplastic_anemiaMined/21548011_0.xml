<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> is a rare and often lethal condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Current knowledge of lymphoid and hematopoietic development in mice, as well as understanding regulators of human hematopoiesis, have led to the recent discovery of genetic causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, in the absence of mutations of specific genes or a distinct clinical phenotype, many cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> are labeled as idiopathic, while congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immune deficiencies</z:hpo> are described as combined <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immune deficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PROCEDURE: We describe the case of a 33-week gestation age male with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001561'>polyhydramnios</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>hydrops</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001541'>ascites</z:hpo> who was noted to be pancytopenic at birth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow examination revealed a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151773" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypocellular marrow</z:e> with absent myelopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An immune workup demonstrated profound B <z:hpo ids='HP_0001888'>lymphopenia</z:hpo>, near <z:mp ids='MP_0008046'>absent NK cells</z:mp>, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> T cell number </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Due to the similarity of the patient's phenotype with the IKAROS knockout mouse, studies were performed on bone marrow and peripheral blood to assess a potential pathogenic role of Ikaros </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: DNA studies revealed a point mutation in one allele of the IKAROS gene, resulting in an amino acid substitution in the DNA-binding zinc finger domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Functional studies demonstrated that the observed mutation decreased Ikaros DNA-binding affinity, and immunofluorescence microscopy revealed aberrant Ikaros pericentromeric localization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our report describes a novel case of congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> associated with mutation of the IKAROS gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, these data suggest a critical role of IKAROS in human hematopoiesis and immune development </plain></SENT>
