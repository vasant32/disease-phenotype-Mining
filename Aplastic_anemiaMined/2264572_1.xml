<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have recently demonstrated that two <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17698">chloramphenicol</z:chebi> (CAP) metabolites known to be produced by intestinal bacteria, dehydro-CAP (DH-CAP) and nitrophenylaminopropane (NPAP), are much more cytotoxic to bone marrow in vitro than CAP itself </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since colony stimulating factors (CSFs) play an essential role in hematopoietic cell growth, toxicity from CAP metabolites could also involve interaction with CSF or CSF-producing cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we found that increasing concentrations of rhGM-CSF or rhG-CSF completely reversed the inhibitory effect of CAP (2 x 10(-4) M) on human CFU-GM growth and on the growth of KG-1 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>GM-CSF also reversed the inhibitory effect of CAP on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Inhibition by DH-CAP (50% at 5 x 10(-7) M), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35801">nitroso</z:chebi>-CAP (NO-CAP) (60% at 5 x 10(-6) M) and NPAP (35% at 10(-5) M) was not affected by either CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition to their inhibitory effect on cell growth, DH-CAP (5 x 10(-6) M) and NO-CAP (5 x 10(-6) M) inhibited CSF production by buffy coat cells 50-70% without affecting cell viability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neither CAP nor NPAP inhibited CSF production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that the dual toxic-inhibitory effect of some intestinal metabolites of CAP such as DH-CAP on hematopoietic cell growth on the one hand, and on CSF production on the other, renders them very potent as potential mediators of CAP induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
