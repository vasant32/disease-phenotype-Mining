<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Lethally x-irradiated CM-S cells from various passages and clones, representing different stages in the progression of the transformed growth phenotype, were tested for their ability to affect the survival and proliferation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human cord or adult blood leukocytes in co-culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One clone, CM-SM, which is tumorigenic in athymic mice, consistently immortalized umbilical cord mononuclear cells but did not immortalize adult peripheral blood leukocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Six autonomous monocyte-like diploid cell lines were obtained and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> were found to be of cord origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three lines were tumorigenic in athymic mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Attempts to immortalize human leukocytes with cell-free supernatants from CM-S cells were unsuccessful </plain></SENT>
