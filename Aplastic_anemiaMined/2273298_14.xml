<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>rEpo was administered by i.v. injection three times a week for at least four weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The doses were 3,000, 6,000, or 12,000 U/day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Despite an elevated "endogenous" Epo level, a greater than 1.5 g/dl increase in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (Hb) concentration was observed in one patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA), one patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess of blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>), and one patient with AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A greater than 50% decrease in red cell transfusion requirement was observed in one patient with RA and one patient with AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One RA patient and one AA patient have received rEpo as maintenance therapy for more than 64 and 100 weeks, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>They no longer need red cell transfusions and have had a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> Hb concentration and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ferrokinetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No side effect was seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that rEpo may benefit some patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and AA who are dependent on red cell transfusions while further studies will be necessary to elucidate the mechanism by which rEpo stimulates erythropoiesis and improves <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> in patients with these diseases </plain></SENT>
