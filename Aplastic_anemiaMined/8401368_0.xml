<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report two patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo>-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> who received recombinant human GM-CSF following HLA-identical sibling allogeneic BMTs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both patients were conditioned with CY 200 mg/kg given over 4 days and received GM-CSF at 250 micrograms/m2 beginning 6 h after marrow infusion and continuing daily until the absolute neutrophil count was &gt; 1.0 x 10(9)/l for 2 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both patients had prompt engraftment, achieving an absolute neutrophil count of &gt; 0.5 x 10(9)/l on day 13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neither patient had side-effects attributable to the GM-CSF although one patient developed severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD after the cessation of GM-CSF therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our experience suggests that GM-CSF can be safely used in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> patients undergoing BMT and that GM-CSF may be useful to decrease the incidence of graft failure associated with less intensive conditioning regimens </plain></SENT>
