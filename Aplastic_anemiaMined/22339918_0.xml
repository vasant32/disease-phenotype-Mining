<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 29 AA patients and 22 controls were recruited in present research </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The expressions of IL-18 and IL-18BP were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expressions of IL-18 and IL-18BP were measured in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The levels of the IL-18 in plasma of AA and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normals</z:mpath> were (365.5 ± 160.6) pg/ml and (175.9 ± 92.8) pg/ml (P &lt; 0.01); and the expression of IL-18 in severe AA patients (441.3 ± 116.9) pg/ml were higher than that in non-severe AA patients (326.4 ± 167.0) pg/ml (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The level of IL-18BP was increased in plasma of AA (1788.6 ± 523.8) pg/ml than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normals</z:mpath> (1083.6 ± 489.6) pg/ml (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>But the ratio of IL-18/IL-18BP in AA patients was much higher than that in controls (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RT-PCR revealed the levels of IL-18 and IL-18BP <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> were up-regulated in AA patients when compared to controls, but the ratio of IL-18/IL-18BP was significantly elevated in AA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: IL-18/IL-18BP imbalance may play an important role in pathogenesis of AA and regulating the balance of IL-18 and IL-18BP may be a therapeutic approach to AA </plain></SENT>
