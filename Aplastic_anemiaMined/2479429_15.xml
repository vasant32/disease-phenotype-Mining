<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In untransfused and pretransfused SAA patients, spontaneous and lectin-induced production of these cytokines by PBMNCs was strongly enhanced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cytokine production in untransfused SAA patients did not differ from that in pretransfused patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Similar relative frequencies of activated (HLA-DR+) lymphocyte subpopulations present in the PBMNCs demonstrated cytokine overproduction per cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cytokine production was studied in three SAA patients before and after blood cell transfusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Spontaneous and lectin-induced production of these cytokines was abnormally high and unaffected by blood transfusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In another patient exhibiting abnormal cytokine production, the hematopoietic response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin-A</z:chebi> in vivo was accompanied by normalization of cytokine production in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that overproduction of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha by lectin-stimulated PBMNCs is an intrinsic abnormality of SAA unrelated to blood transfusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Normalization of production of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha accompanying a clinical response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin-A</z:chebi> may cautiously be taken as further evidence suggesting a pathogenetic role of cytokine overproduction in SAA </plain></SENT>
