<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and IL-6 production in bone marrow fibroblasts from five children with AA in response to cytokines and <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> challenge with cytomegalovirus (CMV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cytokine-stimulated IL-6 production in patients' fibroblasts was significantly reduced, whereas GM-CSF production was found to be comparable to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Also, CMV-mediated stimulation of IL-6 production was significantly lower in bone marrow fibroblasts from patients with AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During the late phase of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010823" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">CMV-infection</z:e>, IL-6 production was suppressed in CMV-infected fibroblasts from patients with AA with 90% inhibition of IL-6 protein production and marked reduction in IL-6 mRNA accumulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Defective IL-6 production in bone marrow fibroblasts might contribute to hematopoietic suppression in some patients with AA </plain></SENT>
