<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This work employs an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> mapping of carbonic anhydrase (CA), isoform I (CA I), for detection of the main immunodominant <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our interest has arisen from an observed <z:mp ids='MP_0002020'>spontaneous tumor</z:mp> regression in patients who developed an <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> type syndrome after a high-dose therapy with autologous stem cell transplantation and whose sera contained high titer of anti carbonic anhydrase (anti-CA) autoantibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There are many indications that the presence of these autoantibodies may provide significant survival benefit for the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Western blot analysis confirmed strong immunoreactivity of the patients' sera with several CA isoforms and the CA I has been selected for our study as a highly abundant and widely distributed isoform </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The applied analytical approach consists of specific fragmentation of CA I protein followed by immunospecific isolation of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> reacting with polyclonal anti-CA I autoantibodies of patients in spontaneous remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We improved the standard <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> mapping schema by incorporating the benefits of magnetic carriers and biomagnetic separation techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mass spectrometry has been applied for detection and identification of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> and the acquired results were verified by bioinformatic tools </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The candidate <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> of CA I (NVGHS, DGLAV, SSEQL, and SLKPI) are discussed herein as potential therapeutic targets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This work highlights the usefulness of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> mapping technique based on magnetic microspheres for effective and rapid determination of immunodominant <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> of the target protein </plain></SENT>
