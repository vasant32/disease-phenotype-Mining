<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: PB T cells subpopulation and BM T cells intracellular IFN-gamma and IL-4 were serially analyzed by flow cytometry (FCM) before and during treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>HLA-DRB1 * 1501 phenotype was analyzed by PCR-SSP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The predictive potentials of different parameter combinations for clinical responsiveness were statistically assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> evaluated parameters, CD8+ cell intracellular IFN-gamma had the relatively best diagnostic value with sensitivity and specificity of 94.3% and 62.5%, and positive and negative predictive value of 84.6% and 83.3% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Positive CD8+ cell intracellular IFN-gamma plus Tc1/Tc2 &lt; 50 could increase the positive predictive value to 92.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A multivariable model consisting of absolute neutrophil count (ANC), BM T cell intracellular IFN-gamma, Tc1/Tc2 ratio and HLA-DRB * 1501 phenotype of the patients was finally established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The multivariable model is superior to each of the single parameters in terms of predictive power of IST therapeutic outcome, and its higher accuracy and the clinical application make it potentially useful in practice </plain></SENT>
