<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-nine patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> (n = 21) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (n = 17) and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (n = 1) were treated with allo-PBSCT from HLA matched siblings (n = 36) or unrelated donors (n = 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six patients were in CsA + MTX group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CsA was given at a dosage of 2 mg.kg(-1).d(-1) by continuous intravenous injection for 24 h, since on day(-1) and injection of CsA was changed to oral administration of CsA around day 18 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CsA was tapered by 10% per week after day + 90 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MTX was given at the dosage of 15 mg at day + 1, and 10 mg at day + 3, + 6 and + 11, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients were included in MMF + CsA + MTX group with the same dosage of CsA and MTX as above but omitted at day + 11 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MMF of 2 g/day was added orally from day + 1 to day + 28 post transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients in both groups were successfully engrafted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The days of recovery of neutrophils and platelets were not significantly different between two groups (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD in MMF + CsA + MTX group (7.6%) was significantly lower than that in CsA/MTX group (46.2%, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Incidence of grade II approximately IV GVHD in MMF group was 0 while that in control group was 23.0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The incidence of severe mucositis was lower in MMF group (15.4%) than in the control group (30.8%) (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The regimen of MMF + CsA + MTX for prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD in allo-PBSCT is more efficient than that of CsA + MTX, without adversely affecting the engraftment and relapse rate </plain></SENT>
