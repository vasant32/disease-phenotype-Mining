<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients with SAA received allogeneic HSCT from haploidentical or unrelated donors (14 from haploidentical donors and 6 from unrelated donors) from November 2005 to May 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Conditioning regimen consisted of fludarabine (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FLU</z:e>), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (Cy) and anti-thymocyte immunoglobulin (ATG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients were administrated with G-CSF-primed bone marrow and mobilized peripheral blood as grafts from haploidentical donor or only mobilized peripheral blood from the unrelated donor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the median time of neutrophil and platelet engraftment were 14 (11 - 20) d and 17 (13 - 31) d respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients who achieved engraftment had complete hematologic recovery with complete donor chimerism, except for two patients who developed graft failure in 2 months after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four cases developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> grade IIGVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD occurred in 7 of the 16 evaluable cases (6 limited, 1 extensive) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>14 patients got disease-free survival with follow-up to January 2012 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The disease-free survival rate was 68.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the haploidentical or unrelated donor hematopoietic stem cell transplantation may become a viable therapeutic option for severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> patients who lack suitable human leukocyte antigen-matched donors and fail immunosuppressive therapy </plain></SENT>
