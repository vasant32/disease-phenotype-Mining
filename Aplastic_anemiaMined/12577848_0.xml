<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To examine the pattern of changes in the count of peripheral granulocytes in children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemias</z:hpo> (AA), receiving a combined immunosuppressive therapy with antithymocytic globulin (ATG) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> in combination with granulocytic colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: 31 children (17 boys and 14 girls) aged 2-15 years (median 9 years) with newly diagnosed severe and very severe acquired AA took a combined immunosuppressive therapy with ATG and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> in combination with G-CSF in an initial dose of 10 micrograms/kg a day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A three-linear and response was recorded in 19 (61%) children, an isolated granulocytic response was in 26 (84%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The interval median before the recovery of granulocytes to 1.5 x 10(9)/l and 5 x 10(9)/l was 19 and 38 days, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Use of G-CSF may increase the count of granulocytes in the vast majority of patients with AA, without dramatic influence on the frequency of a three-linear response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intermittent use of G-CSF may maintain the count of granulocytes long at the safe level and reduce the cost of treatment </plain></SENT>
