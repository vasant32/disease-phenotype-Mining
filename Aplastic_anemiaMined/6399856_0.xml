<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>GVHD is mediated by T cells that contaminate harvested marrow in proportions ranging from 5-50% of the mononuclear cell population </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although T-depleted bone marrow cell recoveries were 2 logs below total harvested buffy coat cell numbers, the TCD mononuclear population was more than 99% viable and was enriched twofold for Ia+ cells as judged by cytofluorographic analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This method is at least the equivalent of those employing lectin column or monoclonal antibody/complement lysis techniques and is simpler to perform </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Successful engraftment of adult patients can safely be obtained with as few as 4 X 10(8) total mononuclear cells following the 24-h procedure suggesting that prolonged or repeated T-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> procedures do not interfere with stem cell engraftment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Preliminary results suggest that this method of TCD may ameliorate GVHD in histoincompatible transplants </plain></SENT>
