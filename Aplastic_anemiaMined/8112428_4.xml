<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have examined the effect of mast cell growth factor (MGF), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and interleukin-3 (IL-3), singly or in combination, on the growth of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) bone marrow in clonogenic assay and long-term bone marrow culture (LTBMC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MGF stimulated colony-forming unit-granulocyte/macrophage (CFU-GM), burst-forming unit-erythroid (BFU-E), and mixed colony-forming unit (consisting of granulocyte-macrophage and erythroid elements) (CFU-GEM) colony formation from both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and AA marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The three-factor combination stimulated the greatest number of colonies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Marrow from less severely affected AA patients was stimulated to produce the highest number of colonies, and a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> response was possible if progenitors were present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When added to LTBMC, MGF alone had little effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>GM-CSF and IL-3 stimulated increased numbers of progenitor cells harvested each week from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and AA LTBMC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This resulted in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colony numbers in some patients, the majority of whom were less severely affected than the patients who did not respond in LTBMC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The three-factor combination was additive for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CFU-GM production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, no further increases in AA LTBMC resulted from the addition of MGF to GM-CSF and IL-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The partial correction in clonogenic assay with MGF in some AA patients raises the possibility of therapeutic benefit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We failed to demonstrate increased progenitor cell numbers in AA LTBMC, however </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further studies may overcome possible limitations to progenitor cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
