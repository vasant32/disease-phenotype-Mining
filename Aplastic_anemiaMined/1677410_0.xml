<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Candida <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> is extremely rare </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there has been a steady increase in the incidence of candida <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> during the last decade because of increasing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006840" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">candida infections</z:e> in immunocompromised hosts, drug addicts, premature babies, and those who have received prosthetic joint operations or intraarticular injections of steroids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report herein two cases of candida <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo>: a 27-year-old man with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and transfusional <z:mp ids='MP_0005639'>hemosiderosis</z:mp>, and a 60-year-old man with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002758'>osteoarthritis</z:hpo> who received repeated intra-articular injections of steroids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Definite diagnoses were made after repeated smear examinations of synovial fluids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the first case, candida <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> occurred about 2 weeks after an antecedent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0877445" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">candidemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> relapsed once due to inadequate antifungal treatment, it was finally successfully treated with systemic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="2682">amphotericin B</z:chebi>, oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48339">ketoconazole</z:chebi> and surgical drainage of the synovial fluid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the second case, it took several months to make the diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patient was also treated with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="2682">amphotericin B</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48339">ketoconazole</z:chebi>, and surgery with a satisfactory outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that since candida <z:hpo ids='HP_0001369'>arthritis</z:hpo> is a slow, less destructive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860281" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">joint infection</z:e>, it can almost always be resolved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Also, late orthopedic complications can be avoided by early diagnosis and prompt treatment, including aggressive antifungal therapy, adequate drainage and necessary surgical intervention </plain></SENT>
