<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The median age was 42 (eight to 73 years); the male:female ratio was 8:14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nineteen patients had severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, and three had moderate disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients received antilymphocyte serum initially while two patients received antithymocyte globulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5120">fluoxymesterone</z:chebi> 10 mg by mouth three times a day with antilymphocyte serum, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> during the course of antilymphocyte serum or antithymocyte globulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were seven responses (31.8 percent) to the first course with four complete responses and three partial responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Six of 15 patients who received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5120">fluoxymesterone</z:chebi> showed a response, compared with zero of five treated without <z:chebi fb="5" ids="50113">androgens</z:chebi> (p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eight patients with no initial response and a patient who experienced a relapse after a complete response were re-treated with either antithymocyte globulin (six) or antilymphocyte serum (three), with four of nine patients (44 percent) having a response (three complete responses, one partial response) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall, 10 of 22 patients (45 percent) had a response (six complete responses, four partial responses) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Median survival for those without a response is six months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Median survival for those with a response has not been reached, with follow-up ranging from 18 to 70 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This study shows the benefit of a second cycle of antilymphocyte serum or antithymocyte globulin and a possible role for concomitant <z:chebi fb="5" ids="50113">androgens</z:chebi> in this treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
