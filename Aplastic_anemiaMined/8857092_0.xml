<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hematopoietic regions were classified into two groups : 1) low intensity hematopoietic areas (LH) isointense to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> marrow and 2) high intensity hematopoietic regions (HH) with higher intensity than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> marrow on op-T1WI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>a) The signal intensity of LH was significantly lower than that of HH on STIR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>b) LH converted in to HH with improvement of laboratory data after therapy, whereas HH decreased with impairment of data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>c) In addition, HH were hyperintense to cerebrospinal fluid on op-T1WI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results indicated that the signal intensity of hematopoietic regions on op-T1WI reflected the cellularity in these regions and that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> included hypercellular regions relative to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> marrow </plain></SENT>
