<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Genetic differences that have been shown in the past to be associated with the Ah locus include an increased susceptibility to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596321" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">chemical carcinogenesis</z:e>, mutagenicity in vitro, and drug toxicity--manifested as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002605'>hepatic necrosis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, or shortened survival time </plain></SENT>
