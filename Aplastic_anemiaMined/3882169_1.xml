<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both patients rapidly recovered <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> marrow function, but marrow failure recurred 13 and 18 months later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because donor and host pairs were identical twins, these cases of graft failure could not have resulted from the usual cause of graft failure, ie, immunological reactivity of host cells against unshared minor histocompatibility antigens of the donor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These results imply that there are at least two mechanisms responsible for graft failure after marrow transplantation for severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
