<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cDNA that corrects one of four FA complementation subtypes, named Fanconi <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> Type C (FAC) has recently been identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We constructed a a simplified recombinant retrovirus (vMFGFAC) encoding only the FAC cDNA, and tested its ability to correct the FAC defect in a lymphocytic cell line and primary mobilized blood progenitor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, the gene transfer efficiency using a clinically applicable gene transfer protocol into <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> primitive hematopoietic progenitor cells, high proliferating potential colony forming cells (HPP-CFC), derived from CD34+ purified cord blood cells was examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The gene transfer efficiency was significantly enhanced when cells were transduced with supernatant while adherent to a 30/35 KD fragment of fibronectin, FN30/35, and was similar to efficiency obtained by coculture with retrovirus packaging cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Transduction of an FAC deficient lymphoid cell line with vMFGFAC supernatant resulted in an enhanced cell viability, and G-CSF mobilized peripheral blood cells from an FAC-deficient patient transduced with the vMFGFAC virus demonstrated enhanced progenitor cell colony formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that the vMFGFAC virus allows functional complementation of FAC in lymphoblasts and primary hematopoietic progenitors, and that primitive cord blood hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells can be transduced at an efficiency comparable to protocols using cocultivation if adherent to FN 30/35 fragment </plain></SENT>
