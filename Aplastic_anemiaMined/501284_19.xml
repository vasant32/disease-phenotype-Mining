<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>An IgM antibody, present in the serum of a female patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, is described that reacted in a modified complement-dependent cytotoxicity test with a subset of the B cells from HLA-A2-positive, but not HLA-A2-negative males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>With the exception of two HLA-A2 positive females, the antibody did not react with other cells from either HLA-A2-positive or HLA-2-negative females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cells of one of these and from HLA-A2-positive males were able to absorb the antibody from the serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cells from other donors were unable to absorb the antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mononuclear cells of the same patient were cytolytic in cell-mediated lympholysis (<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>) for phytohemagglutinin blasts from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> HLA-A2-positive males and one of the females reacting with antibody, but not with blasts from HLA-A2-negative males and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, the results obtained with the antibody in the complement-dependent cytotoxicity test showed an almost perfect correlation with cytolysis in <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the IgM antibody may be the first example with major histocompatibility complex restriction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Because the antibody reacted with the cells from two female donors, the restricting determinant is not, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> probability, the H-Y determinant </plain></SENT>
