<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The T cell-mediated effects of suppression of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hematopoiesis were observed by PBMNC of the patients when cocultured with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The stimulated effects of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi> on BFU-E and CFU-E with <z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> were also studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the PBMNC of 44.4% of the 63 patients suppressed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hematopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>41.3% of the patients responded to <z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> (MT) and 14.3% of the patients had very obvious decrease or absence of BFU-E, CFU-E and CFU-GM without evidence of immunological effects or response to <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>According to these findings, it may be useful for clinicians to choose better therapeutic regimens for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Such as BMT for the patients with hematopoietic stem cells deficiency; immuno-suppression treatment or splenectomy may be of benefit for those who suffered from immune mediated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (IMAA) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37894">androstenones</z:chebi> chosen for those sensitive to MT in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were 15 patients with IMAA treated with immuno-suppressive agents and 19 patients sensitive to MT treated with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="50113">androgens</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of them had satisfactory results </plain></SENT>
