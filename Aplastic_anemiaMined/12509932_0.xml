<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: G-BM plus G-PBSC transplantation was conducted between siblings or between parent and child </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>G-CSF was injected hypodermically into 14 stem cell donors 5 micro g x kg(-1) x d(-1) for 4 approximately 6 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the 3rd day after beginning of G-CSF injection bone marrow blood was extracted from the posterior superior iliac spine of the donors; on the 4th day G-PBSCs were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The collected stem cells were transplanted immediately into the bodies of the 14 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematological disease</z:e>, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelocytic leukemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The clinical outcomes, including the rate of engraftment, speed of engraftment, and the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft versus host disease</z:e> (aGVHD) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft versus host disease</z:e> (cGVHD) were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients got endurable engraftment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median time of recovery of neutrophil count to &gt;or= 1 x 10(9)/L was 14 days (range 12 approximately 18 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median time to achieve a platelet count &gt;or= 20 x 10(9)/L without transfusion was 13 days (range 11 approximately 65 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Seven of the 14 patients developed aGVHD, 4 being in the grade I and 3 being in grade II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Three of the evaluable 9 patients developed extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Two patients died of relapsed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>One patient received secondary PBSCT from hte same donor because of ill engraftment and developed grade IV GVHD and died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The other 11 patients were still alive and event-free with a median follow-up duration of 455 days (range 84 approximately 715 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: An effective treatment for malignant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematological disease</z:e>, G-CSF mobilized allogeneic bone marrow plus peripheral blood stem cells transplantation provides rapid and sustained engraftment without increase in incidence of aGVHD and cGVHD </plain></SENT>
