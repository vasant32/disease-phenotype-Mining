<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent studies from our laboratory have presented evidence that CP-oxamylethanolamine was an end product of CP biotransformation in birds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because this novel metabolic pathway has never been reported in other species, we have now expanded these investigations to rat and humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>[3H]CP was administered po (10 mg/kg) to adult male Wistar rats and to a human volunteer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Urine was collected and analyzed by HPLC and GC-MS for CP metabolite determination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In rat, the two most important metabolites in 0-24 h urine were CP-base and CP-acetylarylamine which together accounted for about 50% of the ingested radioactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The remainder was due to unchanged CP, CP-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="18058">oxamic acid</z:chebi>, CP-alcohol, CP-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="24302">glucuronide</z:chebi>, and CP-oxamylethanolamine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The presence of these end products was also demonstrated in man </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CP-oxamylethanolamine represented 0.74% and 1.37% of the ingested radioactivity in rat and human urine samples, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CP-oxamylethanolamine formation was confirmed in vitro with isolated rat hepatocytes, suggesting the involvement of liver in the production of this metabolite </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The origin of CP-oxamylethanolamine has been investigated with the use of hepatic liver microsomes from <z:chebi fb="1" ids="8069">phenobarbital</z:chebi>-treated rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The incubation of [3H]CP with this subcellular fraction led to the binding of a radiolabeled compound to the microsomal <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipids</z:chebi>, whereas no binding occurred when CP-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="18058">oxamic acid</z:chebi> was incubated with the microsomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Enzymatic hydrolysis of the microsome <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> fraction with phospholipase D from Streptomyces chromofuscus released CP-oxamylethanolamine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
