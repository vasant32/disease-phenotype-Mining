<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: In these last years, despite of routine application of anti-HCV testing, our blood transfusion center has been involved in 53 cases of alleged post-transfusion HCV <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> and look-back programs were set up with the goal of finding out the donors possibly involved in <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> transmission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Most of these patients were hematological cases with multiple transfusions given because of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (3 cases), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> with or without bone marrow transplantation (5/4 cases) but necessitating long-term platelet support, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and solid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients undergoing autologous PBSC transplantation (3/4 cases) and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> (2 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Only 32 patients were of the simple medical or surgical type, 9 transfused because of cardiac or vascular surgery, 8 because of spine surgery, 5 for different diseases and 5 for different types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Donor's infectivity was determined by ELISA anti-HCV testing, by recombinant immunoblotting assay, and by nucleic acid testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: No donors out of 267 traced of a total of 359 involved was found with anti-HCV seroconversion, or positive on PCR testing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This suggests that the responsibility for HCV transmission can only hypothetically be related to blood or blood components and that other transmission routes should be found out </plain></SENT>
