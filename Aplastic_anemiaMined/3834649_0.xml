<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patient assays revealed low colony formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In two patients, colony formation by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> marrow cells in coculture with lymphocytes was suppressed with a colony count increase following T lymphocyte removal from marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Suppressor cells may have caused the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most of the fibroblasts from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals enhanced granulopoiesis in the absence of the colony-stimulating factor, while those from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients failed to do so </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When the colony-stimulating factor was present in the cultures, the degree of suppression of colony formation by fibroblasts derived from the patients was far greater than that by those from the healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that most <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemias</z:hpo> arise from defects of the stem cells and the bone marrow fibroblasts which hold major responsibilities in creating a microenvironment inductive to hematopoiesis </plain></SENT>
