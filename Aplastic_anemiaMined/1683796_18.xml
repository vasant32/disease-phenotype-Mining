<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To determine whether patients with acquired asplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (AA) exhibit clonal hematopoiesis, we used restriction fragment length polymorphisms of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001417'>X-linked</z:hpo> genes phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK1) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17368">hypoxanthine</z:chebi> phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001417'>X-linked</z:hpo> probe M27 beta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of the 19 female patients studied, 18 (95%) patients were informative for at least one marker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of these, eight patients (42%) were heterozygous for PGK1, two (11%) for HPRT, and 16 (84%) for M27 beta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 13 (72%) patients, a monoclonal pattern was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analysis of purified cell suspensions of four of these patients showed that both myeloid and lymphoid cells were of monoclonal origin, indicating the involvement of an early stem cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The four patients who were studied at presentation <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> showed a monoclonal pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One of these patients showed a spontaneous recovery despite persistent clonal hematopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The presence of either clonal or polyclonal hematopoiesis did not show a correlation with the response to antithymocyte globulin (ATG) treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A relapse after ATG was also seen in a patient exhibiting polyclonal hematopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conversely, a monoclonal pattern did not preclude the occurrence of a partial or complete response to ATG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Other potential markers to study clonality, including cytogenetic abnormalities or point mutations of the N-ras protooncogene, were not found in any of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that patients with AA may exhibit clonal hematopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The significance with respect to evolution to disorders with clonal hematopoiesis like <z:hpo ids='HP_0004818'>paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> remains to be determined </plain></SENT>
