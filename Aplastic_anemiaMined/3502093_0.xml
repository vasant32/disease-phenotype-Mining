<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Daily intraperitoneal injection of 1.2 absorbance units (AU, A278) of urinary protein for three consecutive days induced statistically significant increases in rat blood platelet numbers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This increase was observed for 1 of 4 ITP urinary extracts and for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 AA urinary extracts, and occurred 24 h after the final injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In vitro levels of megakaryocyte colony-stimulating factor (Meg-CSF) in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> urinary extracts were similar to those of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> urinary extracts, and were in dramatic contrast to the markedly elevated levels of Meg-CSF in extracts from AA urine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A single intraperitoneal injection of 0.5 AU of AA urinary protein induced a significant increase in spleen-derived megakaryocyte colony-forming cells (CFU-meg) 48 h past injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the group injected with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> urinary extract, CFU-meg levels remained within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> limits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results provide evidence that urinary extracts of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> patients do not contain increased levels of Meg-CSF and a factor which directly stimulates in vivo CFU-meg production, and that the decrease in circulating platelet numbers that is characteristic of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> patients is not a primary in vivo determinant in the elaboration of these factors </plain></SENT>
