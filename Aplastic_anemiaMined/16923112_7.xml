<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, it remains unclear which patients will develop <z:hpo ids='HP_0004787'>fulminant hepatitis</z:hpo>, or whether <z:hpo ids='HP_0004787'>fulminant hepatitis</z:hpo> is caused by host-related factors or by virus-related factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A 30-yr-old man with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> since 3 yr of age underwent allogenic BMT, when HBsAb and HBcAb were positive but HBs antigen (HBsAg) was negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The donor was negative for HBsAg, HBsAb and HBcAb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After transplantation, the patient was complicated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-vs.-host disease</z:e> (GVHD), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010823" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cytomegalovirus infection</z:e>, intestinal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034155" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombotic microangiopathy</z:e> and aspergillus <z:hpo ids='HP_0002583'>colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>His serum HBV-DNA level was &gt;8.8 log of the genome equivalent (LGE)/mL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, he was diagnosed as having <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> B caused by HBV reactivation and 100 mg/d lamivudine treatment was started </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>On analysis of the HBV-DNA, two adjacent gene mutations in the core promoter region (T1762/A1764) were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Increased replication of the mutated HBV might have caused HBV reactivation which progressed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004787'>fulminant hepatitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
