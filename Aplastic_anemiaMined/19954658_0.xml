<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To explore the activation status of signal pathway of mTOR/S6 in bone marrow (BM) T lymphocytes of refractory/relapsed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> patients (AA), and the effects of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">rapamycin</z:chebi> (RAPA) and CTLA-4 immunoglobulin (CTLA-4Ig) on this pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: BM was collected from 13 refractory/relapsed AA patients, 8 newly diagnosed severe AA (SAA) patients and 10 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001891'>iron deficiency anemia</z:hpo> (IDA) (as controls) patients, and cocultured with RAPA and CTLA-4 Ig </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The expression of p-mTOR, p-S6 and Interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) in CD3(+)T cells was measured by flow cytometry (FCM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: (1) The expression of p-mTOR, p-S6 and IFN-gamma in CD3(+)T cells in refractory/relapsed AA group were significantly higher than those in controls (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>(2) The expression of p-mTOR and p-S6 in T cells in newly diagnosed SAA group, was similar to those in controls (P &gt; 0.05), but significantly lower than those in refractory/relapsed AA group (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The expression level of IFN-gamma in T cells were significantly higher than that in controls (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>(3) On exposure to RAPA, the levels of p-mTOR, p-S6 and IFN-gamma in T cells in refractory/relapsed AA patients were significantly lower than those before the exposure (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>And so were when exposed to CTLA-4 Ig (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: (1) The mTOR/S6 signal pathway is activated in refractory/relapsed AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>(2) The expression of p-mTOR, p-S6 and IFN-gamma in refractory/relapsed AA can be suppressed by RAPA or CTLA-4Ig </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>(3) The signal pathway of CD28/mTOR/S6/IFN-gamma might take part in immune pathogenesis of refractory/relapsed AA </plain></SENT>
