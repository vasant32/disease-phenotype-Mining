<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> aplastic crisis usually occurs shortly after <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, however, <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> serologies are usually negative and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> is often fatal if left untreated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE PRESENTATION: A 66-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with <z:mp ids='MP_0001954'>shortness of breath</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001962'>palpitations</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>She was found to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0100598'>pulmonary edema</z:hpo> secondary to a newly diagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> and was treated with rate control and anticoagulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>She was found to have an <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> that was reported to be longstanding and that was apparently being investigated by a hematologist, although no diagnosis had yet been achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Her blood work also revealed a mild <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023530" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">leucopenia</z:e> and pronounced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patient was admitted to ensure appropriate rate control of her <z:hpo ids='HP_0005110'>atrial fibrillation</z:hpo> and for work-up of her <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Review of the bone marrow biopsy performed by the hematologist revealed a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> marrow with no infiltrative process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results of the patient's blood tests ruled out a hemolytic process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was also no evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, toxin ingestion, or recent medication that could be associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>An abdominal ultrasound was ordered to rule out enlargement of the spleen and a possible consumptive <z:hpo ids='HP_0003256'>coagulopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The spleen was mildly enlarged with a diameter of 13 cm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The liver, however, was mildly cirrhotic and a small solitary liver lesion was seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A magnetic resonance imaging scan of the liver confirmed a single solitary solid mass and the alpha-fetal protein level in the serum was elevated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The patient's preliminary <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> serologies were positive for <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The patient was diagnosed with presumed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001402'>hepatocellular carcinoma</z:hpo> and referred to a hepatic surgeon for evaluation of treatment options </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>Hepatitis</z:hpo> associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> is an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> condition while milder more <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> presentations, such as this case, likely result from increased portal pressure generated from the resulting <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo>, which leads to a relative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001971'>hypersplenism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
