<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To identify a new diagnostic marker for the immune pathophysiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA), we screened sera of immune-mediated AA patients for the presence of antibodies (Abs) specific to proteins derived from a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cell line UT-7 using two-dimensional electrophoresis followed by immunoblotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The target proteins were identified by <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> mass fingerprinting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>Heterogeneous</z:hpo> nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) K was identified as a novel autoantigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay revealed high titers of anti-hnRNP K Abs in 85 (31%) of 273 patients with AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sixty-four patients received antithymocyte globulin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> after undergoing screening for anti-hnRNP K Ab, anti-DRS-1 Ab, anti-moesin Ab, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004818'>paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>)-type cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty (87%) of 23 patients with the presence of anti-hnRNP K Abs responded to the immunosuppressive therapy (IST), while 19 (46%) of 41 patients without the presence of anti-hnRNP K Abs responded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A multivariate analysis showed only <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>-type cells and anti-hnRNP K Abs to be significant factors for the prediction of a good response to IST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The detection of anti-hnRNP K Abs as well as <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>-type cells may therefore be useful for diagnosing the immune pathophysiology of AA </plain></SENT>
