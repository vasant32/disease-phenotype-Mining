<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Cytogenetic abnormalities have been described in a few patients with otherwise typical severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (SAA), and the possible clonal nature of this disease is a controversial issue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-nine patients with acquired severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> underwent cytogenetic examination on bone marrow cells at the time of diagnosis (n = 34) and/or at least twice after immunosuppressive therapy (IS) (n = 35) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified 2 major groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Group A: 51 patients (74%) were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and remained <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Group B: 18 patients (26%) had at least one abnormal cytogenetic analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This second group could be further subdivided as follows: (B1) chromosomal abnormalities not present at first examination and acquired in the course of the disease (n = 7); (B2) clonal cytogenetic abnormalities present at first examination and persisting (n = 3); (B3) reversible cytogenetic abnormalities (n = 8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most frequent abnormality was <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 (n = 8) followed by <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 (n = 2); 82% of patients are alive in group A and 61% in group B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three patients developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> from group B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This represents 4% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients or 17% of those with at least one abnormal cytogenetic test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Thus the majority of SAA patients have <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotypes in marrow cells at presentation and at follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with abnormal karyotypes exist and can be further subdivided into those with reversible and those with persistent abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The latter are at risk of developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
