<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Given the paucity of data on the use of agents other than <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> (CsA) in the maintenance phase of immunosuppressive therapy (IST) for severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (SAA) in children, we sought to describe our experience with tacrolimus in pediatric SAA, and to compare outcomes with a preceding series of patients who received CsA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eight patients with SAA diagnosed between 2003 and 2008 for whom no human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched sibling donor was identified underwent tacrolimus-based IST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These children were compared with a previously described series of 13 patients who had undergone CsA-based IST at our institution between 1990 and 2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients initially received equine antithymocyte globulin (ATG) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Complete response (CR) rate was 88% for tacrolimus and 85% for CsA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median time to CR was approximately 7 months in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median follow-up duration was 2.4 years for tacrolimus and 8.4 years for CsA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among responders with de novo SAA, relapse rate was 25% (n = 1) at 2 years for tacrolimus and 0% at 2 years and 23% (n = 3) at 5 years for CsA; no significant difference in relapse-free survival was detected between the two groups (P = 0.07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0004818'>Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</z:hpo> was seen in one patient on tacrolimus who had relapsed after CsA-based IST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Tacrolimus-based IST was well-tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These data provide evidence that tacrolimus may be a suitable alternative to CsA as part of an IST regimen for SAA in children who lack an HLA-matched sibling and may have a more favorable profile of side effects than CsA </plain></SENT>
