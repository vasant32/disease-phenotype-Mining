<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We performed an immunohistochemical analysis to study an autopsy case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and diabetic <z:mp ids='MP_0005638'>hemochromatosis</z:mp> caused by frequent blood transfusions, and extensive hemosiderin deposition was observed in the liver and pancreas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The pancreatic islets of the patient and a control subject were stained to detect glucagon, insulin, and proinsulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Significantly lower levels of immunoreactivity with both insulin antibodies and proinsulin antibodies, but not with glucagon antibodies, was observed in the islet cells in the patient's tissue than in the islet cells of the control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hemosiderin deposition in the islets is known to be exclusively distributed in the β-cells, thus, selective iron-induced damage to the β-cells may have affected insulin synthesis and secretion and led to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> in the patient </plain></SENT>
