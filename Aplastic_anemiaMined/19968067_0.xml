<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Blood samples were collected from 8 patients with BMF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Telomere lengths of mononuclear cells from 8 BMF patients and granulocytes from 3 of these 8 BMF patients (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these 3 patients were suffered from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>) were measured using Flow-FISH, and the results were compared with those of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Telomere lengths were measured by Southern blot in 3 patients, and the results were compared with those obtained from Flow-FISH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among these 8 BMF patients, 5 have decreased telomere length in their mononuclear cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, different white cell subgroups, specifically mononucleated cells and granulocytes, have different degree of telomere shortening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 3 BMF patients who underwent both Flow-FISH and Southern blot, 2 patients had consistent measurement results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Flow-FISH can be used for the measurement of telomere length in Chinese patients with BMF </plain></SENT>
