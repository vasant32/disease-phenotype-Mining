<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the advantage of using antithymocyte globulin (ATG) in the IST and its outcome of children with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="35738">MAA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-two children diagnosed with moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> from 1993 to 2006 were retrospectively reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eighteen patients treated with ATG, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> (CSA), and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi> are defined as the ATG group, the other 24 patients treated with CSA and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi> are defined as the non-ATG group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Survival and hematological response of the two groups were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Response rate and transfusion-independent survival of the ATG group were both significantly higher than those of the non-ATG group (83.33 vs. 41.7%, p = .006; and 83.33 vs. 50%, p = .043, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compared with non-ATG group, fewer patients in ATG group progress to severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (p = .03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Immunosuppressive therapy including ATG benefits children with moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
