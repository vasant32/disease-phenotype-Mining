<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, blood counts of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> children show wide age-related variation, therefore we must establish a system of adjustment for diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The data of children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> visiting our institutes from 1966 to 1990 were evaluated for this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RBC below 350 x 10(4)/microliters, WBC below 4,000/microliters or neutrophils below 1,500/microliters, platelets below 8 x 10(4)/microliters, reticulocytes below 4 x 10(4)/microliters and lymphocytes over 60% were seemed to satisfy the diagnostic criteria of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> proposed by the Study Group of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemopoietic Disorders</z:e> sponsored by the Ministry of Health and Welfare of Japan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fifteen children (4.6%) did not meet these criteria and as such were diagnosed as atypical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirteen of them were in a pre-aplastic state and developed typical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> within 6 months to 8 years after the initial diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clinical findings of these patients showed the decrease in number of megakaryocytes and committed stem cells in bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three of these patients developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> non-lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, and 2 of them were diagnosed as Fanconi's <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
