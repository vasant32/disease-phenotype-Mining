<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four trichothecenes, T-2 toxin, HT-2 toxin, DAS and DON have been tested on human platelet progenitors (CFU-MK) using a culture model of CFU-MK optimized for toxicological studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Trichothecenes cause, at low concentrations, cytotoxic effects in megakaryocyte progenitors, which could induce <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity of human CFU-MK is compared to respective sensitivities of human red blood cell progenitors (BFU-E) and white blood cell progenitors (CF-U-GM) that were described in previous works </plain></SENT>
