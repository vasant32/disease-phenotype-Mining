<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Whereas no radiation-induced aberrations could be found in the bone marrow, apart from a transient finding in the patient with the lowest radiation dose, aberrant metaphases were seen in the peripheral lymphocytes of three patients in the range from 2.5 to 46% even at 861 days after the exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were no demonstrable aberrations related to TBI in the only patient developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The dicentric yield as determined in the aberrant metaphases with 46 centromeres ranged between 3.4 +/- 1.3 and 4.9 +/- 0.4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In one patient it was demonstrated by BUdR-labeling that after 10 Gy (1000 rad) TBI the surviving and heavily damaged lymphocytes can go into cell cycle and reach at least the third mitosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The percentage of aberrant cells diminished by about 25% at each mitotic division </plain></SENT>
