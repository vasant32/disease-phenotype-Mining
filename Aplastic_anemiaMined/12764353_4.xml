<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Marrow donors were genotypically HLA-identical siblings in 30 cases and a monozygous twin in one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The median time from diagnosis to bone marrow transplantation was 1 month (range, 0.5-5 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Conditioning regimen consisted of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (CY) combined with antithymocyte globulin (ATG), in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
