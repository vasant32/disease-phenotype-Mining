<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Treatment with a bolus of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi> (mPSL) was associated with a good response and a partial response in 19.4% and 1.4% of the patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast, two kinds of antilymphocyte globulin (ALG) were effective for 9.4% and 15.6% of the severe form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, and two kinds of antithymocytoglobulin (ATG) were effective in 30.8% and 37.2% of the patients, although the difference between ALG and ATG was not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We recommend that patients diagnosed as having severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> should be referred as soon as possible for treatment with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressive agents</z:chebi> or bone marrow transplantation, the latter depending on disease severity, age, and potential availability of an HLA-identical sibling donor </plain></SENT>
