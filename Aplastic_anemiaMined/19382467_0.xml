<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the potential usefulness of a multivariable model, established mainly upon peripheral T-cell subsets, Th1/Th2, T-bet and GATA-3 gene expressions as well as TCM and Western medical diagnostic criteria, in predicting the selection of immunosuppressive therapy (IST) or <z:chebi fb="5" ids="50113">androgens</z:chebi> in treating patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Peripheral blood T cell subsets in 85 patients with AA were serially analyzed by flow cytometry before and after treatment, and their T-bet and GATA-3 gene expressions were assessed meantime by Real-time PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Then analysis of Logistic regression equation and ROC curves were performed based on the cases responding to IST or <z:chebi fb="5" ids="50113">androgens</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: (1) According to the logistic equation and ROC curve of SPSS, setting the false positive rate as 0.10, the P value was 0.832 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When P&gt; or =0.832, patients were judged in the immunosuppressive dominant state, IST should be applied; when P&lt;0.832, it means patients in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> dominant state, <z:chebi fb="5" ids="50113">androgens</z:chebi> should be added </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>(2) A novel theory is raised by the above-mentioned analysis, which indicated that the genesis and development process of AA could be divided in 2 stages, the abnormal immune dominant stage and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> dominant stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For treatment of patients in the two stages, IST and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="50113">androgens</z:chebi> is the preference respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The multivariable model could be used for indicating which stage the AA patient is in, the abnormal immune stage or the <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> stage, and thus to guide the proper selection of IST or <z:chebi fb="5" ids="50113">androgens</z:chebi> in clinical practice </plain></SENT>
