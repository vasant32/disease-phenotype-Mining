<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Flow cytometry analysis of peripheral blood cells is a simple and reliable method for establishing the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004818'>paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The behavior of the clone may vary; increasing or diminishing over time but prospective study of such variations have not been reported so far </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We report herein the results of a prospective follow-up study of 25 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our aims were twofold: first, to evaluate the behavior of the clone (using flow cytometry) over the time; and second, to evaluate if such variations could predict the occurrence of complications or could be used as a tool for monitoring the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0543478" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">residual disease</z:e> after bone marrow transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: It was found that flow cytometry can be used to specifically follow the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0543478" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">residual disease</z:e> post allogeneic marrow transplantation in four patients, and that even without transplantation the defective clone can significantly decrease or even disappear (three patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We found that most of the patients did have significant change in the amount of affected cells during more than three years, and that an <z:mp ids='MP_0001264'>increased size</z:mp> of the clone poorly predicted the occurrence of complications </plain></SENT>
