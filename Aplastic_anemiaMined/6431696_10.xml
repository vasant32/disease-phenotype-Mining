<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It has been recommended that red blood cell transfusions to patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019045" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemoglobinopathy</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> be matched for antigens other than ABO and Rho(D) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied 1,010 patients with disorders that often lead to repetitive transfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The frequency of transfused patients with clinically important antibodies was not significantly different among the disease groups except for those with lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The frequency of multiple red cell antibodies was about 3% overall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most antibodies (71%) developed early in the transfusion course, before the 15th transfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>From the standpoints of frequency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948201" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">alloimmunization</z:e>, multiplicity of antibodies, and time course of antibody development, patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019045" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemoglobinopathy</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> were not significantly different from other transfused patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Matching for antigens other than ABO or Rho(D) might increase costs in our hospital by 40,000-370,000 dollars per year for these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Because morbidity or mortality due to these antibodies is rare, antigen matching for other than ABO and Rho(D) is not cost-effective </plain></SENT>
