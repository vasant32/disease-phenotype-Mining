<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cellularity was evaluated with a better accuracy from biopsies as compared to aspirates and iron kinetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Only bone marrow biopsies assessed myeloid "hot spots", which featured as favorable prognostic parameters in addition to the usual prognostic indices </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The presence of megakaryocytes provided another positive prognostic influence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100827'>lymphocytosis</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085663" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">plasmocytosis</z:e>, and stroma injuries were negative in terms of prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Such histological data should be systematically studied in AA at the time of initial evaluation and taken into account prior to choice of therapy </plain></SENT>
