<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Antithymocyte globulin (ATG) is the standard therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) patients who are not eligible for allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The exact mechanism of action of ATG is still not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Profound <z:hpo ids='HP_0001888'>lymphopenia</z:hpo> is observed throughout the treatment period with ATG and appears to contribute to its immunomodulatory effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One of the possible mechanisms, which could account for ATG-mediated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001888'>lymphopenia</z:hpo>, is by induction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, there is no conclusive evidence to support this mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether ATG could induce an in vivo <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in PBMCs of 12 AA patients undergoing ATG therapy by terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (TdT)-mediated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17625">dUTP</z:chebi> nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay using flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A significant increase in the percentage of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was observed in six patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median percentage prior to therapy was 3 percent (range: 1-10 percent), which increased to a peak median value of 27 percent (range 17-66 percent) with therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>ATG also induced an in vitro <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> PBMCs as demonstrated by Annexin V and TUNEL staining using flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Induction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was dose dependent: 52 percent of the PBMCs exhibited Annexin V positivity after incubation with ATG at a dose of 500 microg/ml for 6 h, and 37 percent of the PBMCs exhibited DNA fragmentation after incubation with ATG at a dose of 1000 microg/ml for 24 h as demonstrated by TUNEL assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, ATG induces in vivo <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in PBMCs of AA patients undergoing therapy as well as an in vitro <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> PBMCs, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> may be an important mechanism for ATG-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001888'>lymphopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
