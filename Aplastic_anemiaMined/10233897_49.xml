<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Complement-mediated <z:mp ids='MP_0010163'>hemolysis</z:mp>, impairment of the fibrinolytic system, or platelet activation are thought to be responsible for the associated thrombotic risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated here the elevation of membrane-derived procoagulant microparticles in the blood flow of such patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Elevated levels of circulating microparticles were in fact detected in both de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> patients and AA subjects with a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> clone, but not in those with AA without a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> clone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cellular origin of the microparticles was determined in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> samples; most stemmed from platelets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Glycophorin A+ particles were rarely detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, platelet activation, resulting in the dissemination of procoagulant <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16247">phospholipids</z:chebi> in the blood flow, could be one of the main causes for the elevated thrombotic risk associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest that shed membrane particles can be considered a valuable biological parameter for the assessment of possible thrombotic complications in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
