<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although up-regulated telomerase activity is closely linked to the cellular immortality characteristic of late stage <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e>, recently, mutations in the telomerase <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> gene in humans have been associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0009563'>dyskeratosis</z:mp> congenita and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, both typified by impaired haemopoietic function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These mutations include base changes in a highly conserved putative telomerase <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> pseudoknot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, by using in vitro telomerase assays, NMR, and UV absorbance melting analyses of model oligonucleotides designed to form a "trans-pseudoknot," we describe functional, structural, and energetic properties of this structure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate that the pseudoknot domain exists in two alternative states of nearly equal stability in solution: one is the previously proposed pseudoknot formed by pairing P3 with the loop domain of P2b, and the other is a structured P2b loop alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We show that the two-base mutation (GC1078 --&gt; AG) present in one gene copy in a family with <z:mp ids='MP_0009563'>dyskeratosis</z:mp> congenita abrogates telomerase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This mutation hyperstabilizes the P2b intraloop structure, blocking pseudoknot formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conversely, when the P3 pseudoknot pairing is hyperstabilized by deleting a conserved bulge in P3, telomerase activity also decreases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We propose that the P2bP3 pseudoknot domain acts as a molecular switch, and interconversion between its two states is important for telomerase function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Phylogenetic covariation in the P2b and P3 sequences of 35 species provides a compelling set of "natural" compensatory base pairing changes supporting the existence of the crucial molecular switch </plain></SENT>
