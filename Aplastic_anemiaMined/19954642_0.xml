<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty-one patients with BCTP, 10 with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (SAA) and 13 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls were enrolled in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The quantity of BM macrophages was measured by FACS and their function was evaluated by phagocytosis test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The number of macrophages, phagocytosis ratio and index of cock's red blood cells (CRBC) in BCTP patients were (0.57 +/- 0.30)%, (37.56 +/- 15.20)%, and 0.75 +/- 0.34, respectively, being significantly higher than those in SAA group \[0.46 +/- 0.08)%, (28.26 +/- 10.46)%, and in 0.59 +/- 0.39\] and in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control \[0.44 +/- 0.69)% (25.63 +/- 14.75)%, and 0.55 +/- 0.16\] (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The BCTP patients were classified into two subgroups according to the quantity of macrophages: Group A (M(Phi) &gt; or = 0.5%, 34 cases) and Group B (M(Phi) &lt; 0.5%, 27 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were 32 cases (94.12%) with BMMNC-IgG(+) in Group A and only 2 cases (7.41%) in Group B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were significant differences in phagocytosis ratio and index of macrophages between Group A \[46.62 +/- 13.38)% and 0.91 +/- 0.36\] and Group B \[(28.67 +/- 12.59)% and 0.61 +/- 0.30\] (P &lt; 0.05), while no statistical differences between group B and other two control groups (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirty-four BMMNC-IgG(+) patients were further divided into two subgroups: High level (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>) group \[&gt; or = 0.75%, 9 cases (26.47%)\] and Low level (LL) group \[&lt; 0.75%, 25 cases (73.53%)\] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only one lineage of BMMNC-IgG could be detected in LL group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among 9 patients in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e> group, 8(23.53%) had two lineages of BMMNC-IgG and 1(2.94%) had three lineages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Phagocytosis ratio and index of macrophages were significantly higher in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e> group \[(60.22 +/- 12.51)% and 1.23 +/- 0.23\] than in LL group \[(43.32 +/- 9.24)% and 0.84 +/- 0.24\] (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The level of peripheral blood(PB) RBC, HGB and PLT in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e> group were significantly lower than in LL group (P &lt; 0.05), while the percentage of Ret, the level of TBIL and the ratio of erythroid of sternal BM in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e> group were significantly higher than in LL group (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: More quantity and stronger function of macrophages are observed in BCTP patients with BMMNC-IgG(+) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>One of the mechanism of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1168524" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematocytopenia</z:e> might be that macrophages activated by IgG autoantibodies phagocytose hematopoietic cells in BM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Macrophages do not involve in damage process of BM in BCTP with IgM or cold autoantibodies </plain></SENT>
