<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Sublethally irradiated CBA/J mice injected with lymph node cells (LNC) of C3H/He mice exhibit <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> within 3 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>Aplastic anemia</z:hpo> plasma (AAP) from these mice was found to inhibit granulocyte-macrophage colony (GM-CFU) formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This inhibitory action was not strain specific and was not generated in donor:host combination involving other strains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AAP also inhibited the formation of colonies derived from leukemic cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Though this activity inhibited GM-CFU, it did not affect erythroid colony formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two experiments were performed to examine the mechanism of inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Superoptimal concentrations of recombinant mouse granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) did not reverse AAP-induced inhibition of colony formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow cells preincubated with AAP for 24 h and washed were unchanged in their ability to form GM-CFU colonies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, the inhibitory activity acted neither as a competitive nor a cytotoxic agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Interferons and certain <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandins</z:chebi>, known to inhibit colony formation, were not found in active concentrations in AAP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The inhibitory activity of AAP was heat stable, nondialyzable, inextractable with <z:chebi fb="59" ids="35255">chloroform</z:chebi>, precipitable with 50% <z:chebi fb="28" ids="28938">ammonium</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16189">sulfate</z:chebi>, and had a molecular weight of 100,000 daltons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In contrast, control plasma from mice given only sublethal irradiation and injected with saline had significantly less inhibitory activity, which was not heat stable and was extractable with <z:chebi fb="59" ids="35255">chloroform</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Thus, LNC in certain host mouse strains generate a plasma activity that can inhibit the formation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and leukemic GM-CFU colonies </plain></SENT>
