<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This prospective randomized trial compared the effect of antihuman thymocyte globulin (ATG) versus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> as treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) in recipients of HLA-identical allogeneic bone marrow transplants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients undergoing transplantation as therapy for either <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> were given <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> as postgrafting immunosuppression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients who nevertheless developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD of moderate severity were randomized to receive either <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> therapy or ATG therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty-seven patients were randomized: 20 patients received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi>, and 17 received ATG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both ATG and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> were in general well tolerated, although <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients receiving ATG developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> and chills </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both treatment modalities were associated with a mild decrease in severity of GVHD after therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was, however, no significant difference between treatment groups, whether assessed by improvement in specific organ involvement, improvement in the overall grade of GVHD, need for additional therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD, or the proportion of patients who developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Infectious complications and survival were also not different between treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> were as effective as ATG for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD in recipients of HLA-identical marrow transplants and, therefore, appear to be a reasonable choice as primary therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD </plain></SENT>
