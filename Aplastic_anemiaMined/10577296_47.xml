<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of and risk factors for malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo> in long-term survivors must be assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the risk and define potential risk factors for new malignant conditions in long-term survivors after marrow transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective multicenter study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Study of the Late Effects Working Party with 45 transplantation centers cooperating in the European Cooperative Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: 1036 consecutive patients who underwent transplantation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, inborn diseases of the hematopoietic and immune systems, or severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Transplantation was done before December 1985, and patients had survived more than 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS: Reports on malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> were evaluated, and the incidence was compared to that in the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patient age and sex, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277554" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary disease</z:e> and status at transplantation, histocompatibility of the donor, conditioning regimen, type of prophylaxis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e>, development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e>, and treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> were evaluated as variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Median follow-up since transplantation was 10.7 years (range, 5 to 22.1 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> were seen in 53 patients; the actuarial incidence (+/- SE) was 3.5% +/- 0.6% at 10 years and 12.8% +/- 2.6% at 15 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The rate of new malignant disease was 3.8-fold higher than that in an age-matched control population (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The most frequent malignant diseases were <z:hpo ids='HP_0008069'>neoplasms of the skin</z:hpo> (14 patients), oral cavity (7 patients), uterus (including cervix) (5 patients), thyroid gland (5 patients), breast (4 patients), and glial tissue (3 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Median age of patients and their donors was 21 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> were more frequent in older patients and in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Older patient age and treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> were significant risk factors for new malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> after bone marrow transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The spectrum of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> and immunosuppressive treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> as dominant risk factors indicate that immunosuppression is the major cause of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> in patients receiving marrow transplants </plain></SENT>
