<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study was longitudinal and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were followed for at least 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Once a year TSH, T4, T3 and the TRH test were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (n = 6) were transplanted without total body irradiation (TBI) and they had no detectable alterations in thyroid function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (n = 27) were conditioned with 10 Gy TBI in one fraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The accumulated frequencies of thyroid dysfunction were 3 of 27 (11%) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002925'>high TSH</z:hpo> and low T3 or T4 levels, and 10 of 27 (37%) with high basal TSH and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> T3 and T4 levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An additional 11 of 27 (41%) had an exaggerated TSH response in the TRH test and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> basal TSH and T3/T4 levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only 3 of 27 (11%) continued to have <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Treatment with levo-<z:chebi fb="4" ids="30660">thyroxine</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="18332">L-T4</z:chebi>) was given to the patients with a high basal TSH level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>As 24 of 27 (89%) children had signs of disturbance in the thyroid axis, prophylactic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18332">L-T4</z:chebi> treatment for a few years after BMT with TBI may be of value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The main cause of a change in thyroid function after BMT seems to be conditioning with TBI </plain></SENT>
