<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with inactivating mutations in Mpl develop <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> because of progressive loss of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSCs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Yet, it is unknown whether this loss of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSCs</z:chebi> is an irreversible process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we used the Mpl knockout (Mpl(-/-)) mouse model and expressed Mpl from newly developed lentiviral vectors specifically in the physiologic Mpl target populations, namely, <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSCs</z:chebi> and megakaryocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After validating lineage-specific expression in vivo using lentiviral eGFP reporter vectors, we performed bone marrow transplantation of transduced Mpl(-/-) bone marrow cells into Mpl(-/-) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We show that restoration of Mpl expression from transcriptionally targeted vectors prevents lethal adverse reactions of ectopic Mpl expression, replenishes the <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSC</z:chebi> pool, restores stem cell properties, and corrects platelet production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In some mice, megakaryocyte counts were atypically high, accompanied by bone neo-formation and marrow <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Gene-corrected Mpl(-/-) cells had increased long-term repopulating potential, with a marked increase in lineage(-)Sca1(+)cKit(+) cells and early progenitor populations in reconstituted mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Transcriptome analysis of lineage(-)Sca1(+)cKit(+) cells in Mpl-corrected mice showed functional adjustment of genes involved in <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSC</z:chebi> self-renewal </plain></SENT>
