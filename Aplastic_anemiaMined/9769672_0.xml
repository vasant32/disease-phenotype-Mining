<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is a benign lymphoproliferative, usually self-limiting disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Complications are relatively rare, but they may occur, especially hematological </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Most common are autoimmune hematolytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, and they respond to corticoid therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Deuteration of white blood cells is rather rare, whereas mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> is a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> finding during the course of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, <z:mp ids='MP_0000334'>agranulocytosis</z:mp> is extremely rate, and almost every case has been reported in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Filgrastim--the recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) stimulates the activation, proliferation and maturation of progenitor granulocyte cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This drug is usually applied in treatment of iatrogenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo>, during chemotherapy of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> and in some idiopathic and cyclic neutopenias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: A female patient, 18 years of age, has been hospitalized at the Clinic of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Infectious Diseases</z:e> in Novi Sad on two occasions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>First because of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious mononucleosis</z:e> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000952'>jaundice</z:hpo> 10 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Physical examination revealed severe intoxication, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001944'>dehydration</z:hpo>, icteric skin, mucosis and massive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001433'>hepatosplenomegaly</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis was confirmed by ELISA IgM, EBV VCA positive and ELISA IgG EBV VCA and IgG EBVNA negative results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The patient was discharged from hospital after 24 days without complaints and with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> physical and laboratory findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>For several days she felt well, but gradually severe <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> and malaise occurred and she became febrile again </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>That was the reason why she was hospitalized again, two weeks later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This time she was febrile, extremely intoxicated with general <z:hpo ids='HP_0002716'>lymphadenopathy</z:hpo>, catarrhal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149704" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">gingivostomatitis</z:e> and massive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001744'>splenomegaly</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The first laboratory findings showed severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> (absolute count of granulocytes was 0.156 x 10/l, with only 12% segmented neutrophils) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>--3.05 x 10/l was also registered, while the platelet count was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Other biochemical analyses were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, the Coombs' test negative, while the serological response was also <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow puncture was performed and normocellular bone marrow was registered, somewhere hypercellular due to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> of granulocyte progenitor cells from promyelocytes to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> maturated cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>Anemia</z:hpo> showed megaloblastoid proliferation, while megakaryocytes were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>High doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> were applied (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> 160 mg daily) and filgrastim 5 micrograms every other day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>From the very beginning of therapy the patient felt better, whereas granulocytes responded with elevation as soon as 48 hours after initiation of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>On the sixth day the treatment was stopped because the level of granulocytes was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and the patient has completely recovered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>She was discharged from hospital 4 weeks later with mild <z:mp ids='MP_0009247'>meteorism</z:mp>, but <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> physical and laboratory findings and mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001744'>splenomegaly</z:hpo> registered only by ultrasonography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: During the last 10 years only several cases of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001882'>leukopenia</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious mononucleosis</z:e> had been reported in literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases it was associated with some other hematological complications and it occurred in young adults without previously registered <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>We have no knowledge about application of filgrastim in treatment of EBV-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0000334'>agranulocytosis</z:mp>, but the International Association for Studying <z:mp ids='MP_0000334'>Agranulocytosis</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>Aplastic Anemia</z:hpo> reported that in 4% of patients Epstein-Barr virus can cause <z:mp ids='MP_0000334'>agranulocytosis</z:mp> even a year after the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> disease </plain></SENT>
