<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eight of these children (20%) with a transfusional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e> had been undergoing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49005">deferasirox</z:chebi> treatment during the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the English literature, transfusional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e> and the use of an iron <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38161">chelator</z:chebi> in children with FAA has not yet been evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here, we have presented the effectivity and tolerability of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49005">deferasirox</z:chebi> in children with FAA and a transfusional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Before the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49005">deferasirox</z:chebi> treatment, the mean serum ferritin level was 3377 ± 2200 ng/mL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After a mean 13.6-month treatment duration, the mean ferritin level decreased to 2274 ± 1300 ng/mL (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In our series, 3 patients had renal and 3 had hepatic toxicity during the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030781" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">peliosis hepatis</z:e> and 2 had congenital renal abnormalities before the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There may be differences in the side-effect profiles of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49005">deferasirox</z:chebi> treatment in patients with FAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In our series, despite the low number of cases, nephrotoxicity and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0235378,C0348754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Injury or Poisoning" abbrv="">hepatotoxicity</z:e> were common side effects instead of gastrointestinal disturbances reported in other studies </plain></SENT>
