<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Nearly one hundred years ago clinical and epidemiological studies have already assigned <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> as a markedly haematotoxic substance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nowadays <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> is known as an important professional noxa, which is straight off directed against the haematopoietic system, essentially to a dose-time-effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By this it can be taken as a model also for other noxious substances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Similar solvents often contain so-called "hidden <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi>", that means not declared <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi>, so that the consumer don't know what dangerous substance are available for his personal use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Impairment caused by <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> mostly are manifested earliest after months, years or for tens of years, and the point is, that these haematopoietic disorders are irreversible disturbances of the haematopoietic stem cell compartment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The consequence of this fact is a deep involvement of the proliferation of the erythro-, mono-, granulo- and thrombopoietic cell lines, mostly with the predominance of one of these myeloproliferative cell systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the further progression of the impairments due to <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> three different clinical pictures can be observed: the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1368107" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aplastic bone marrow</z:e> syndrome (i.e. <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>), the haematopoietic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (i.e. <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026986,C0033027" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">preleukemia</z:e>) and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemias</z:hpo> (with the subtypes <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272138" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">erythroleukosis</z:e>, myeloblastic-promyelocytic or myelomonocytic from respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Also the transition from one clinical picture to another is possible </plain></SENT>
