<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using bone marrow culture in vitro which had been accomplished in our laboratory, 53 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> were also classified according to TCM term in three groups as Yin deficiency, Yang deficiency and both Yin and Yang deficiency, and the correlation was observed between TCM classification and lab character of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the number of CFU-GM, CFU-E and BFU-E in Yang deficiency group was significantly higher than that in the other two groups (P less than 0.01 and P less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It also showed that the sensitivity of progenitor cells to androgenic hormones of Yang deficiency group was preferential to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> (P less than 0.005 and P less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The percentage of immunosuppressive type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> in Yin deficiency group was much higher than those in the other two groups (P less than 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These observations suggested that TCM classification for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> in this paper has objective material foundation </plain></SENT>
