<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>No patient previously had evidence of hematologic dysfunction or conditions known to be associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No other cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> were identified among 1463 patients undergoing liver transplantation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other indications at the four centers participating in the study (chi-square = 415, P less than 0.001; 95 percent confidence interval for the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> after transplantation for non-A, non-B <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo>, 13 to 44 percent, vs. 0.00 to 0.13 percent for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other indications) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The operative and postoperative treatment of these patients was not otherwise different, indicating that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> was a complication of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo>, not of the transplantation procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four of the nine patients died of complications due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three of the surviving patients have been followed for less than six months, one for one year, and one for two years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The two patients followed the longest have recovered marrow function to an appreciable degree, and two of the others have evidence of early recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that patients undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation for non-A, non-B <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> are at a high risk for the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
