<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The OKT4:OKT8 ratio was decreased in patients due to a reduction in the percentage of OKT4+ cells and 3 out of 18 patients had a ratio less than 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The values of the OKT4:OKT8 ratio were not associated either with the severity of the disease or with treatment with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="50113">androgens</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between the OKT4:OKT8 ratio and the number of transfusions received by patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, studies performed with bone marrow lymphocytes showed that the OKT4:OKT8 ratio for both patients and controls was lower than that of the peripheral blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Since the ratio of OKT4:OKT8 cells in aplastic and control bone marrow was similar no direct pathogenic role can be assigned to the marrow for the imbalance detected in the peripheral blood </plain></SENT>
