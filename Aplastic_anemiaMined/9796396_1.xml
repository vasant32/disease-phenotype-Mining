<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We administered ATG combined with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> (CyA), to 9 patients (4 men and 5 women; median age, 55 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>AA was severe in 8 patients and moderate in 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The ATG and CyA regimen was the initial treatment for 3 patients, but sequential treatment for the other 6, who were refractory to other agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Peripheral T lymphocytes, including CD4-positive and CD8-positive cells, decreased rapidly after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although 1 patient died of <z:mp ids='MP_0001182'>pulmonary hemorrhage</z:mp> during the 6-month period following treatment with this combined regimen, 3 showed a favorable response, 2 moderate response, and 3 no response at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Adverse drug reactions, including transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015230" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rash</z:e>, were not severe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings suggested that ATG and CyA in combination are a safe and effective immunosuppressive regimen for initial and refractory patients with AA </plain></SENT>
