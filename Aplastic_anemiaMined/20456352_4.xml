<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Year, month, season of diagnosis, type and outcome of first-line therapy were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Prevalence of HAA (n = 214) in Europe was 5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Compared to non-HAA patients, HAA patients were younger (15 vs. 20 years, P &lt; 0.001), with a male prevalence (68% vs. 58% P = 0.002), and were treated earlier after diagnosis (46 vs. 62 d; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No significant differences were found regarding the year or month of diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No geographic clusters could be identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Actuarial survival at 10 years after first-line immunosuppression was 69%, and did not differ according to aetiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 10-year actuarial survival after transplantation was 70%, and was comparable in HAA and non-HAA patients, when stratified for age and donor type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In a multivariate Cox analysis, increasing age and delayed treatment were significant negative indicators for survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the incidence of HAA was 5% and was evenly distributed over time and geographic areas in Europe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Treatment outcome and predictive variables, were comparable in patients with or without HAA </plain></SENT>
