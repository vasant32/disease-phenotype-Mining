<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since June, 1984, a cooperative group, including 83 University medical centers throughout metropolitan France, prospectively recorded new cases of AA and followed them up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Inclusion criteria were: at least two depressed blood cell lineages (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> less than or equal to 10 g/100 mL and reticulocytes less than or equal to 50 x 10(9)/L, granulocytes less than or equal to 1.5 x 10(9)/L, platelets less than or equal to 100 x 10(9)/L) and a bone marrow biopsy compatible with the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Between May, 1984, and April, 1987, 292 cases were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After exclusion of constitutional disease, 27 patients did not satisfy the inclusion criteria with relation to either bone marrow or blood evaluations and seven patients were initially misdiagnosed (shown in the follow-up), leaving 250 confirmed AA cases in the register </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The annual incidence in France appeared to be about 1.5 per million inhabitants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The sex ratio of AA cases was similar to that of the population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In men, two peaks of incidence were observed: one between 15 and 30 years and one after 60 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In women, the only peak was observed after 60 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>An excess of cases was observed in small towns but not in rural areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>About two of every three cases had severe AA, with a possible excess in younger cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Based on a minimum follow-up of 1 year for 238 patients, the fatality rate was estimated at 17% at 3 months after diagnosis and at 34% at 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Among 243 suspected etiologies reported by the physicians, 74% were declared idiopathic, 13% presumably associated to drug toxicity, and 5% related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>AA appears to be a rare and severe disease in metropolitan France, often of unknown origin, a fact that emphasizes the necessity of controlled etiologic studies </plain></SENT>
