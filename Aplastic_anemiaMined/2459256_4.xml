<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Several murine monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) specific for human erythropoietin (HuEpo) were produced by hybridomas obtained from the fusion of murine <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> cells, P3X63-Ag.8-653, with the splenocytes of mice immunized with recombinant human Epo (rHuEpo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Based on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> analysis by a competitive binding assay, these MAbs could be classified into at least three groups: (1) 1E10, (2) 1H7, (3) 2D6, 3D6 and 3D8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), using these MAbs as the solid-phase antibodies, MAb-bound HuEpo was detected with rabbit anti-HuEpo sera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Some combinations of two different classes of MAbs, such as 1H7 and 3D8, were found to capture much more HuEpo than each MAb used individually </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Urinary HuEpo (U-HuEpo) was highly purified from the urine of patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> with about 50% final recovery using an immunoaffinity column on which a mixture of 1H7 and 3D8 was immobilized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The purified U-HuEpo had a specific activity of 77,340 U/mg in a radioimmunoassay (RIA) and of 76,673 U/mg using an in vivo bioassay </plain></SENT>
