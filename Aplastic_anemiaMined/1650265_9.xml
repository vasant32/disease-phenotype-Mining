<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Indications for autologous BMT were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemias</z:hpo> and for allogeneic BMT various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were divided for the study in two groups, CMV-positive and CMV-negative on the basis of the CMV status pretransplant, and CMV-negative patients were kept CMV-negative by the local transfusion policy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In allogeneic BMT recipients, platelet recovery was significantly slower in CMV-positive patients than in CMV-negative patients (platelets greater than 50,000 cells/microL after 41 days v 27 days, P = .007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This difference held true when patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> above grade I were excluded (platelets greater than 50,000 cells/microL after 42 days v 24 days, P = .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In autologous BMT, the negative effect on platelet recovery was present in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, but absent in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemias</z:hpo> had a very delayed recovery of platelets and granulocytes after autologous BMT, irrespective of the CMV status, probably due to the original stem cell disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Platelet recovery was significantly slower in CMV-positive autologous BMT recipients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> than in those not infected (platelets greater than 50,000 cells/microL after 36 days v 24 days, P = .0002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010823" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">CMV infection</z:e> had no effect on the recovery of granulocytes in autologous or allogeneic BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data show that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010823" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">CMV infection</z:e> causes delayed platelet recovery after BMT; however, in autologous BMT, the underlying disease (ie, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo>) is more determinant for hematopoiesis after BMT </plain></SENT>
