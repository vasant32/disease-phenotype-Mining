<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite being younger, FA patients had an increased risk of grades II to IV AGvHD (relative risk [RR], 2.00; P =.021), especially in younger patients (RR, 7.93; P =.014) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The risks of requiring systemic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> to treat AGvHD and experiencing cortico-resistant AGvHD were significantly increased in FA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although non-FA and FA patients had similar 10-year outcomes, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GvHD had a biphasic effect on FA patient outcome with an additional cluster of lethal events starting by 5 years after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This late survival fall, restricted to FA patients, was closely related to head and neck <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> (15-year incidence: 53%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>FA patients represent a group at risk regarding AGvHD when using irradiation-based conditionings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The impact of AGvHD on survival may not be limited to the early posttransplantation period and may be a major risk factor for head and neck <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinomas</z:mp> and late mortality in FA patients </plain></SENT>
