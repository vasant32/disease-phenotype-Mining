<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The molecular weights of u-PAs from the chest fluids were 200 Kd, 150-180 Kd, 95 Kd, 55 Kd, 44 Kd, 33 Kd and 14 Kd, and PA activity was observed at molecular weights of 95 Kd, 55 Kd and 33 Kd </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fibrin binding of u-PA was observed at molecular weights of 55 Kd and 33 Kd </plain></SENT>
