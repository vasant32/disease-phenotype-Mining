<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the rest of 101 patients there was a highly significant positive correlation (p less than 0.001) of the survival time to the bone-marrow cellularity and to the average values of corrected reticulocytes and granulocytes calculated from findings of 0,4, and 8 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For thrombocytes, however, a slightly significant positive correlation (p less than 0.05) could only be identified in the present material for the 4-weeks value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The fact that the prognosis is deteriorated by a rapid development of the disease could be made probable by means of a positive correlation between the time of the first symptom and diagnosis (p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With patients falling below 2 or 3 limiting values of the peripheral blood cells they were classified to the SAA group according to the proposals made by Camitta, however, by using the average values described above The survival rate which remained constant after 3 years amounted to 16% for SAA patients classified in this way, 44% for non-SAA cases with constant values of 39% beginning from the fourth year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with average values of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three cell parameters falling below those limiting areas had a six months survival time of only 11% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No patients were alive after one year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The latter was also true if reticulocytes and granulocytes were affected by a diminution of only 2 parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Those patients, however, who had an average of reticulocytes and thrombocytes only, but no granulocytes below the limiting area within the first 8 weeks showed a mortality curve which did not differ from that of non-SAA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, a classification of these cases can only be made with great caution allowing for a prognosis-oriented therapy, such as indication for bone-marrow transplantation </plain></SENT>
