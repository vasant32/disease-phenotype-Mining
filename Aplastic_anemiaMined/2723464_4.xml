<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Near confluent to confluent adherent layers developed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cultures from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects and AA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>When present, the 'cobblestone' areas in LTMC from AA subjects were smaller than those observed in the LTMC from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The decline in total and viable cell numbers in the LTMC was similar for both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects and AA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units (CFU-gm) were present in nonadherent cells (NAC) from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> LTMC for a mean of 5.2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CFU-gm were present in the NAC of only two of the eight AA cultures for one week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The absent or small 'cobblestone' areas and the absence of CFU-gm production in AA-LTMC suggest a decrease in the reproductive potential of adherent hematopoietic stem cells, which may be the result of either an abnormal hematopoietic stem cell or an abnormal stromal microenvironment or both </plain></SENT>
