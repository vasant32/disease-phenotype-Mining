<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo> to hematopoietic progenitors is thought to be responsible for its pathogenesis, little is known about the molecular basis of this <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we show that a substantial proportion of AA patients harbor clonal hematopoiesis characterized by the presence of acquired copy number-neutral loss of heterozygosity (CNN-LOH) of the 6p arms (6pLOH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The 6pLOH commonly involved the HLA locus, leading to loss of one HLA haplotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Loss of HLA-A expression from multiple lineages of leukocytes was confirmed by flow cytometry in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 6pLOH(+) cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, the missing HLA-alleles in 6pLOH(+) clones were conspicuously biased to particular alleles, including HLA-A*02:01, A*02:06, A*31:01, and B*40:02 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A large-scale epidemiologic study on the HLA alleles of patients with various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic diseases</z:e> revealed that the 4 HLA alleles were over-represented in the germline of AA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that the 6pLOH(+) hematopoiesis found in AA represents "escapes" hematopoiesis from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo>, which is mediated by cytotoxic T cells that target the relevant auto-antigens presented on hematopoietic progenitors through these class I HLAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results provide a novel insight into the genetic basis of the pathogenesis of AA </plain></SENT>
