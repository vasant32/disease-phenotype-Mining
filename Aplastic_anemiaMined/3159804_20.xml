<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The graft-versus-host reaction (GVHR) in both mice and humans can lead to the development of a broad spectrum of clinical and pathological symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These symptoms are strikingly similar to those of a number of diseases of proven or presumed immunological origin, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE), other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0262428" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">collagen vascular diseases</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024314" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphoproliferative disease</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of our investigation was to describe the immunological and pathological events that take place in the course of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) and to gain insight into the cellular mechanisms underlying these events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To this end, a model was employed in which nonirradiated F1 mice were used as recipients of parental lymphoid cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By pathological manifestations, 2 basic forms of GVHD can be distinguished in such non-irradiated F1 recipients: One is <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD which is often lethal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is characterized by a variety of suppressive (hypoplastic) pathological symptoms, including a severe <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> of the lymphohemopoietic system accompanied by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004313'>hypogammaglobulinemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The other basic form is characterized by stimulatory symptoms, such as persistent <z:mp ids='MP_0000688'>lymphoid hyperplasia</z:mp>, formation of autoantibodies, and development of pathological symptoms reminiscent of SLE and other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0262428" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">collagen vascular diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The suppressive pathological graft-versus-host (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GVH</z:e>) symptoms are caused by T suppressor/killer (TS/K) cells of the donor which react towards allogeneic class-I-structures of the F1 recipient's major histocompatibility complex (MHC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The stimulatory pathological <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GVH</z:e> symptoms, by contrast, are caused by donor T helper (TH) cells which react toward the recipient's allogeneic class-II-MHC structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The possible implications of these observations for the pathogenesis of a number of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GVH</z:e>-like diseases in humans are discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The hypothesis is advanced that some of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GVH</z:e>-like conditions, which arise either e causa ignota or after exposure to certain viruses or drugs, are caused by T lymphocytes reacting against self-MHC structures on lymphohemopoietic cells that were rendered "foreign" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>By analogy to GVHD, it is conceivable that the development of either stimulatory or suppressive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GVH</z:e>-like symptoms in individuals exposed to a given virus or sensitizing drug depends not on the etiologic agent per se, but on whether the predominant response is made by the individual's TH or TS@K cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This, in turn, might depend on whether the agent becomes immunogenic in combination with class-II or class-I alloantigens </plain></SENT>
