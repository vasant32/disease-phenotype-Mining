<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a prospective clinical trial, 134 patients were randomly assigned to receive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> alone or in combination with ATG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received T-cell-replete bone marrow from an HLA-matched sibling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up of 6 years, the 5-year probabilities of survival were 74% for the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> alone group and 80% for the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> plus ATG group (P = .44) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Graft failure and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) rates were similar in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With the survival rates achieved, this study is not adequately powered to detect significant differences between the 2 treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the results of allogeneic BMT for SAA have improved over time related to advances in supportive care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The addition of ATG to the preparative regimen did not significantly improve the outcome </plain></SENT>
