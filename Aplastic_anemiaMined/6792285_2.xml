<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Purified rabbit IgG anti-human IgG antibodies are conjugated to beta-galactosidase with meta-maleimidobenzoyl-hydroxysuccinimide <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">ester</z:chebi> as a bifunctional reagent and o-nitrophenyl-beta-galactopyranoside as a substrate to evaluate the enzymatic activity of the labeled antiglobulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The sera of 26 patients suffering from various diseases (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo>) and 40 control subjects were assayed with the enzyme-labeled reagent and, for comparison, with an indirect immunofluorescence technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Half of these patients had never been transfused </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0003454'>Platelet antibodies</z:hpo> were detected by both assays in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the transfused patients except one, and in 3 out of 13 non-transfused patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The sera of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the control subjects were negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Quantitation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003454'>platelet antibodies</z:hpo> was obtained by a sensitive antiglobulin absorption technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A method for standardization of the reagents allowing comparison of results obtained in the same patient at different times and suitable for long-term follow-up studies is also described </plain></SENT>
