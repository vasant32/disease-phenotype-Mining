<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To explore the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of refractory cytopenia of children (<z:chebi fb="60" ids="47899">RCC</z:chebi>) according to WHO classification, and discuss the relationship between the cytology reviewed by hematologists and histology reviewed by pathologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We selected 50 non-severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> cases from 2007 - 2010 in our hospital and collected clinical data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Experienced hematologists and pathologists evaluated bone marrow biopsy and smear respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 50 cases, 23 were male and 27 female (M:F = 1:1.17), the median age at diagnosis was 9 years (ranged from 3 to 14 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>5 patients had disagreement of diagnosis between hematologists and pathologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 3 cases hematologists diagnosed as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) and pathologists as <z:chebi fb="60" ids="47899">RCC</z:chebi>, 2 cases vice versa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The final diagnoses of 50 patients reached consensus between hematologists and pathologists were AA 16 cases, <z:chebi fb="60" ids="47899">RCC</z:chebi> 34 cases including 8 refractory cytopenias with multilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RCMD</z:e>) cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 16 cases AA showed severe hypocellularity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only 4 cases (25.00%) <z:chebi fb="60" ids="47899">RCC</z:chebi> showed severe hypocellularity, 19 cases (73.08%) <z:chebi fb="60" ids="47899">RCC</z:chebi> showed mild hypocellularity and 3 cases (11.54%) <z:chebi fb="60" ids="47899">RCC</z:chebi> were nomal hypocellularity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results suggests that <z:chebi fb="60" ids="47899">RCC</z:chebi> was not rare in China </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The main feature of <z:chebi fb="60" ids="47899">RCC</z:chebi> was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> because of absence of increased blast </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="60" ids="47899">RCC</z:chebi> was easily confused with AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The main points of differential were present dysplastic changes of megakaryocyte best appreciated by the hematologists and morphologists and abnormal location of hematopoietic easily observed by pathologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Overall, cytology and histology were complementary in the investigation of <z:chebi fb="60" ids="47899">RCC</z:chebi> and AA, because of sometimes one might give information that not be gived from the other </plain></SENT>
