<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to investigate the expression of GATA-1, GATA-2 and GATA-3 genes in the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (cAA) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mononuclear cells (MNCs) were isolated from BM of patients with cAA (8 cases) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (9 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Adherent cells (i.e. BMSCs) were collected after long-term culture in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The semi-quantitative expression levels of GATA genes were analyzed by using RT-PCR-enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (RT-PCR-ELISA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The BMSCs with cAA grew slowly compared with the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> BMSCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In BMSCs, only the expression ratio of GATA-3 gene from cAA group (50.0%) was significant lower than the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (P &lt; 0.05), the expression ratios of other GATA genes from cAA group were similar to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in the expression level of GATA-1 gene in the BMSCs between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls and cAA group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The expression level of GATA-2 gene in BMSCs from cAA was significantly lower than that from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The expression level of GATA-3 gene in BMSCs from cAA was significantly higher than that from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The dominant expression of GATA-3 gene was found in the BMSCs from cAA and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>GATA genes can be expressed in the BMSCs and may play a role in the regulation of hematopoiesis in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals, as well as in patients with cAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The change of expression levels of GATA genes may influence the hematopoiesis in BM microenvironment and relate to the pathogenesis and development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
