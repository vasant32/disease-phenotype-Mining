<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The demographic features showed a high relative incidence (<z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo>/AA ratio, 2.2/1), a high percentage of non-severe AA (39%) and a high association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> (20.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> A, B or C <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042769" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">virus infection</z:e> was found in five cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo>-associated AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No sex preponderance was noted in this pediatric series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 10-year projected survival rate of the total series approached 55% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The crude two-year-survival and two-year-transfusion-free-survival rates were 59% and 44%, respectively, in the conservative therapy group treated with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="50113">androgens</z:chebi> and steroids; 36% and 32%, respectively, in patients with severe AA in the conservative therapy group; and 73% and 64%, respectively, in the aggressive therapy group treated with cyclosporin, anti-lymphocyte globulin or bone marrow transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The major causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> (44%) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> (56%) in the conservative therapy group; but in the aggressive therapy group, two out of three <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were related to therapeutic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis of prognostic factors revealed that severity and treatment modality were independent risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only two out of 31 patients who survived more than two years (long-term survivors) experienced late mortalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At two, five, seven and 10 years after diagnosis, 61%, 55%, 41% and 40% of the long-term survivors had inadequate hematopoietic recovery </plain></SENT>
