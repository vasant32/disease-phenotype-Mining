<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-five patients with CCA were assigned into two groups, the 26 patients in the treated group were treated by Shengxuening (a Chinese herbal preparation) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> (CsA), and the 19 patients in the control group were treated with <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi> alone, with the therapeutic course lasting for over 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Changes of peripheral blood picture, and the colony productivity of burst forming unit-erythroid (BFU-E), colony forming unit-erythroid (CFU-E) and colony forming unit-granulocyte macrophage (CFU-GM) in bone marrow were observed before and after 3 months treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The amount of erythrocyte and platelet infusion, frequency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, condition of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> and relevant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were also observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The follow-up study was conducted for over half a year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The total effective rate in the treated group was 84.6%, which was significantly higher than that in the control group (52.6%, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>, reticulocyte, neutrophil and platelet increased after treatment in the treated group, as compared with those before treatment, with significant difference (P &lt; 0.05), and the colony productivity of BFU-E, CFU-E and CFU-GM in bone marrow also got significantly increased (P &lt; 0.01), and showed significant difference from those in the control group (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Shengxuening-assisting CsA therapy is an effective measure for treatment of CAA </plain></SENT>
