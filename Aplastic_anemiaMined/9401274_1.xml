<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present report, we analyzed 40 Turkish AA patients, who received immunosuppressive therapy (IST) and 12 AA's who were transplanted from HLA matched siblings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>HLA DR2 frequency was 0.442 and significantly higher in AA's when compared to an unrelated healthy control group (RR: 2.93, 95% confidence interval 1.48-5.77, P = 0.001 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients received antithymocyte or antilymphocytic globulin (AT/LG) or AT/LG plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi>-A (CsA) or CsA alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In DR2+ and DR2- patients overall response rates were 73.3 and 30%, respectively (P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When patients were analyzed separately, CsA administration either alone or in combination with AT/LG gave favorable results in the DR2+ group (P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast AT/LG presence alone was shown to be inadequate </plain></SENT>
