<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Bone marrow has been shown to be superior to peripheral blood, as a stem cell source, in young patients (&lt;20 years of age) with acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> undergoing a matched sibling transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to test whether this currently also holds true for older patients with acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: We analyzed 1886 patients with acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> who received a first transplant from a human leukocyte antigen identical sibling between 1999 and 2009, with either bone marrow (n=1163) or peripheral blood (n=723) as the source of stem cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In multivariate Cox analysis negative predictors for survival were: patient's age over 20 years (RR 2.0, P&lt;0.0001), an interval between diagnosis and transplantation of more than 114 days (RR 1.3, P=0.006), no anti-thymocyte globulin in the conditioning (RR 1.6, P=0.0001), a conditioning regimen other than <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (RR=1.3, P=0.008) and the use of peripheral blood as the source of stem cells (RR 1.6, P&lt;0.00001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The survival advantage for recipients of bone marrow rather than peripheral blood was statistically significant in patients aged 1-19 years (90% versus 76% P&lt;0.00001) as well as in patients aged over 20 years (74% versus 64%, P=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The advantage for recipients of bone marrow over peripheral blood was maintained above the age of 50 years (69% versus 39%, P=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> were more frequent in peripheral blood transplants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Major causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (2% versus 6% in bone marrow and peripheral blood recipients, respectively), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> (6% versus 13%), and graft rejection (1.5% versus 2.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that bone marrow should be the preferred stem cell source for matched sibling transplants in acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, in patients of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> age groups </plain></SENT>
