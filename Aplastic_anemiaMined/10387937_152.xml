<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND METHODS: It is uncertain whether mortality rates among patients who have undergone bone marrow transplantation return to the level of the mortality rates of the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the characteristics of 6691 patients listed in the International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients were free of their original disease two years after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mortality rates in this cohort were compared with those of an age-, sex-, and nationality-matched general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional-hazards regression was used to identify risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> more than two years after transplantation (late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among patients who were free of disease two years after transplantation, the probability of living for five more years was 89 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 88 to 90 percent) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among patients who underwent transplantation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> by the sixth year after transplantation did not differ significantly from that of a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mortality remained significantly higher than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> throughout the study among patients who underwent transplantation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> and through the ninth year among those who underwent transplantation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> was the chief cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> among patients who received a transplant for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, whereas <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> was the chief cause among those who received a transplant for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Advanced, long-standing disease before transplantation and active <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> were important risk factors for late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In patients who receive an allogeneic bone marrow transplant as treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> myelogenous or lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and who are free of their original disease two years later, the disease is probably cured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, for many years after transplantation, the mortality among these patients is higher than that in a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> population </plain></SENT>
