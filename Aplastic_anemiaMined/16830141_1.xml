<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>ALG gives about 60% overall survival rate (OS) after 5 years, a 30% of persistent complete remission and a 20% early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate related to failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>ALG has been incriminated in the emergence of 10 to 20% therapy-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e> (t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e>) with the usual doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Questions remain whether higher doses of ALG could improve the response and OS rates and whether the combination with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="50113">androgens</z:chebi> is able to protect patients from t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have carried out a single institutional retrospective study of 87 AA treated with higher doses of ALG, twice the usual posology (140 mg/kg instead of 75 mg/kg), combined to <z:chebi fb="5" ids="50113">androgens</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The overall response rate was 77% and the OS rate at 5 years was 78% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="5" ids="50113">Androgens</z:chebi> in combination with ALG improved response and OS rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At diagnosis, 6% of AA had an abnormal karyotype using conventional cytogenetic not related to any time-to-event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two patients displayed a cytogenetic conversion related to the occurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">secondary malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The incidence of t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1332153" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">AML/MDS</z:e> was 2.3% with an estimated 10-year cumulative incidence of 3.1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our results show that higher doses of ALG combined to <z:chebi fb="5" ids="50113">androgens</z:chebi> are feasible and give results close to those recently describe with the immunosuppressive treatments including ALG associated to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi>, with a low <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SMD</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> incidence rate </plain></SENT>
