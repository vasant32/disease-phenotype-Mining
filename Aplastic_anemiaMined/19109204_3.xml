<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine the roles of anti-moesin Abs derived from the serum of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) in the pathophysiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo>, we studied the expression of moesin on various blood cells and the effects of anti-moesin Abs on the moesin-expressing cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The proteins recognized by anti-moesin mAbs were detectable on the surface of T cells, NK cells, and monocytes from healthy individuals as well as on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46941">THP</z:chebi>-1 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> mass fingerprinting of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46941">THP</z:chebi>-1 cell surface protein and the knock-down experiments using short hairpin <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> proved that the protein is moesin itself </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both the anti-moesin mAbs and the anti-moesin polyclonal Abs purified from the AA patients' sera stimulated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46941">THP</z:chebi>-1 cells and the PBMCs of healthy individuals and AA patients to secrete 60-80% as much TNF-alpha as did LPS 100 ng/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although the polyclonal Abs induced IFN-gamma secretion from the PBMCs of healthy individuals only when the PBMCs were prestimulated by anti-CD3 mAbs, the anti-moesin Abs were capable of inducing IFN-gamma secretion from the PBMCs of AA patients by themselves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Anti-moesin Abs may therefore indirectly contribute to the suppression of hematopoiesis in AA patients by inducing myelosuppressive cytokines from immunocompetent cells </plain></SENT>
