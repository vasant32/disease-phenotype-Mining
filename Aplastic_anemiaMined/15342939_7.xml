<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Damage to macromolecules resulting from <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> metabolites and misrepair of DNA lesions may lead to changes in hematopoietic stem cells (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSCs</z:chebi>) that give rise to leukemic clones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have shown previously that male mice exposed to <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> by inhalation were significantly more susceptible to <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi>-induced toxicities than females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSCs</z:chebi> are targets for <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi>-induced cytotoxicity and genotoxicity, we investigated DNA damage responses in <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSC</z:chebi> from both genders of 129/SvJ mice after exposure to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16509">1,4-benzoquinone</z:chebi> (BQ) in vitro or <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>1,4-BQ is a highly reactive metabolite of <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> that can cause cellular damage by forming protein and DNA adducts and producing reactive oxygen species </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSCs</z:chebi> cultured in the presence of 1,4-BQ for 24 hours showed a gender-independent, dose-dependent cytotoxic response </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Rad51, xpc, and mdm-2 transcript levels were increased in male but not female <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSCs</z:chebi> exposed to 1,4-BQ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Males exposed to <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> exhibited higher <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels for xpc, ku80, ccng, and wig1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These gene expression differences may partially explain the gender disparity in <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> susceptibility </plain></SENT>
