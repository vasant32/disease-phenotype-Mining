<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present report we extend these studies by measuring T cell subsets identified by the presence of Fc receptors for IgM (T mu-lymphocyte) and IgG (T gamma-lymphocyte) in 22 patients and in 48 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The absolute number of T mu and T gamma lymphocytes was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in the majority of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The percentages of T mu cells was increased in 4 cases and decreased in 2; T gamma cells were increased in 6 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The levels of serum immunoglobulins did not correlate with the T mu/T gamma ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> is discussed in terms of these <z:hpo ids='HP_0002715'>immunological abnormalities</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
