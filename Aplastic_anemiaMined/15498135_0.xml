<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Immune-mediated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> mice were developed, IL-3 in the supernatant with PHA stimulating splenic cells was detected by ELISA, semi-quantiting analysis of IL-3R was performed by point hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the IL-3 level in the supernatant with PHA stimulating splenic cells of immune-mediated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> mice was higher than controls, difference between them was significant (P &lt;0.001), while amount of IL-3 receptor by semi-quantiting analysis was lower than control significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the IL-3 receptor expression level is important for pathogenesis and treatment strategy of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
