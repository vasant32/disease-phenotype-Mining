<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Antibody levels of patients who received immunisation during reinduction therapy were not correlated with intervall between immunisation and previous or next reinduction, not correlated with intervall from start of therapy, but seemed inversely correlated to age at time of diagnosis and at time of immunisation </plain></SENT>
