<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Erythroblasts were classified according to nuclear area as well as to morphological appearance after Giemsa staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Grains over individual erythroblasts and reticulocytes were counted by incident light microphotometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Reticulocytes from <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30396">phenyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15571">hydrazine</z:chebi>-treated rats served as internal standards in order to allow a comparison of different experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The preliminary results from one <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow, one of stress erythropoiesis and two of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> revealed the major content of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5386">globin</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in the states of basophilic erythroblasts or proerythroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases there was a tendency of decreasing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5386">globin</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> content towards orthochromatic erythroblasts, and even more so, towards reticulocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results show some differences between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and diseased erythropoiesis which are under study on a larger scale now in order to ascertain their significance </plain></SENT>
