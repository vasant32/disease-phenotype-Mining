<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To study the biological characteristics of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) in children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) and evaluate the relationship of biological characteristics of MSC with the efficacy of immunosuppressive therapy (IST) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Bone marrow-derived MSC were cultured and isolated from 29 children with AA and 5 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seventeen out of the 29 cases received IST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Surface markers and cell cycle of MSC at passage 3 were analyzed by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation by MSC was evaluated and TGF-beta 1 level in the supernatant of MSC was detected using ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001507'>Growth abnormality</z:hpo> of MSC was found in 16 children with AA (55%), characterized by deficiency and poor proliferation of MSC, and was frequently seen in patients with severe AA or in patients with more prolonged disease course or in patients with radiation/chemotherapy-induced AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Surface markers, cell cycle and TGF-beta 1 level in the supernatant of MSC at passage 3 and the inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation by MSC in the AA group were similar to those in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eight out of nine patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> MSC growth achieved complete remission (CR) but only 2 out of 8 patients with abnormal MSC growth achieved CR following IST ( P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Bone marrow-derived MSC <z:hpo ids='HP_0001507'>growth abnormality</z:hpo> occurs in most of children with AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>MSC abnormality may affect adversely hematological recovery following IST </plain></SENT>
