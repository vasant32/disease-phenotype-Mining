<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>Aplastic anemia</z:hpo> is a rare and severe disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its incidence varies considerably worldwide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed at describing the epidemiology of this disease, including the incidence, mortality and survival trends, in a well-defined population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: Since 1980, a case-control surveillance study of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> has been carried out by a cooperative group, in the metropolitan area of Barcelona </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Inclusion is dependent on the patient having at least two of the following features: white blood cell count &lt; or = 3.5 x 10(9)/L, platelet count &lt; or = 50 x 10(9)/L, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> &lt;10 g/L or hematocrit of &lt;30%; when only one of these last two criteria is fulfilled, a reticulocyte count of &lt; or = 30 x 10(9)/L is also required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The bone marrow biopsy has to be compatible with the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Between 1980 and 2003, a total of 235 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The overall incidence was 2.34 per million inhabitants per year and the incidence increased with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Most of the cases were classified as severe or very severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Survival rates at 3 months, and at 2 and 15 years after the diagnosis were 73%, 57%, and 51%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Advanced age and more severe disease at the time of diagnosis were associated with a lower survival rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was a trend to a better 2-year survival rate among patients treated with bone marrow transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Forty-nine cases (20.8%) were exposed to drugs reported to be associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, and 21 (8.9%) to toxic agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> in Barcelona is low but the case fatality rate is high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Advanced age and severe disease at the time of diagnosis were associated with decreased survival </plain></SENT>
