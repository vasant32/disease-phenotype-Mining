<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of Fanconi <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (FA) is based on the association of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1705254" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">congenital malformations</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> syndrome, and hypersensitivity to chromosomal breaks induced by cross-linking agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the absence of typical features, the diagnosis is not easy to establish because there is no simple and cost-effective test; thus, investigators must rely on specialized analyses of chromosomal breaks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because we observed elevated serum alpha-fetoprotein (sAFP) levels in FA patients, we investigated this parameter as a possible diagnostic tool </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum AFP levels from 61 FA patients and 27 controls with acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> or other inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> syndromes were analyzed using a fluoroimmunoassay based on the TRACE technology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum AFP levels were significantly more elevated (P &lt;.0001) in FA than in non-FA aplastic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the detection of FA patients among patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> syndromes, this assay had a sensitivity of 93% and a specificity of 100% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This elevation was not explained by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001392'>liver abnormalities</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Levels of sAFP were unchanged during at least 4 years of follow-up, and allogeneic bone marrow transplantation did not modify sAFP levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three of 4 FA patients with mosaicism as well as 5 of 6 FA patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> were detected by this test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Heterozygous parents of FA patients had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> sAFP levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Measurement of sAFP levels with this automated, cost-effective, and reproducible fluoroimmunoassay could be proposed for the preliminary diagnosis of FA whenever this disorder is suspected </plain></SENT>
