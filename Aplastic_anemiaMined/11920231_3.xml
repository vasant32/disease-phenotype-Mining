<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>-phenotype has been described in various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0947743,C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematological disorders</z:e>, mainly in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo>, while it has been reported that complete deficiency of CD55 and CD59 has also been found in patients with lymphoproliferative syndromes, like non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The presence of CD55- and/or CD59-defective red cell populations was evaluated in 217 patients with lymphoproliferative syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study population included 87 patients with NHL, 55 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>, 49 with CLL, 22 with ALL and four with hairy cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One hundred and twenty-one healthy blood donors and seven patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> were also studied as control groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The sephacryl gel microtyping system was performed for the detection of CD55- and CD59-deficient red cell populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ham and <z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi> lysis tests were also performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> samples with CD55 or CD59 negative populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Red cell populations deficient in both CD55 and CD59 molecules were detected in 9.2% of patients with lymphoproliferative syndromes (more often in ALL and nodular <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> type of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>) and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CD55-deficient red cell populations were found in 8.7% of LPS patients (especially in low grade B-cell NHL), while CD59-deficient populations were found in only two patients with low grade B-cell NHL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These data indicate a possible association between <z:hpo ids='HP_0004818'>paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</z:hpo> phenotype and lymphoproliferative syndromes, while further investigation is necessary to work out the mechanisms and the significance of the existence of this phenotype in these patients </plain></SENT>
