<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A prospective, randomized clinical trial was conducted to determine whether the outcome of SAA patients treated with the combination of antilymphocyte globulin(ALG) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> A(CsA) (intensive immunosuppressive therapy, IIST) was better than that with ALG alone (non-intensive immunosuppressive therapy, NIIST) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The response rate of IIST group(83.7%) was significantly higher than that of NIIST group(57.6%), with a lower risk of early mortality and a shorter time to red cell transfusion independence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the recovery of bone marrow BFU-E and CFU-GM of the responding patients was more complete in IIST group than in NIIST group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The treatment outcome was better with IIST than with NIIST for SAA </plain></SENT>
