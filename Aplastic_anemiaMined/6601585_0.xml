<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The inhibitory effects of adherent cells were studied by means of co-culture with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> allogeneic bone marrow cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The suppression of these inhibitory effects was also examined by adding <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi> to the co-culture system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi> concentrations in the adherent cell-conditioned media were assayed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The inhibition of the colony growth by peripheral blood adherent cells from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> patients was not significantly different from controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both the suppression of the inhibitory effects by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi> and the level of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15551">PGE2</z:chebi> production showed no significant difference between the patients and controls </plain></SENT>
