<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty-six patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematological diseases</z:e> (40 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo>, 24 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, and one each severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005283" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">beta-thalassemia</z:e>) received bone marrow (BMT, n = 48) or peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT, n = 18) from HLA-compatible unrelated donors after BUCY or TBI conditioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty patients received longer and intensive GVHD prophylaxis (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> from day -10 combined with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="168396">mycophenolate</z:chebi> mofetil) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixty-four patients achieved sustained donor engraftment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median time of leukocyte engraftment was 15 days, being significantly earlier in PBSCT group compared with BMT group (12 vs 16 days, P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cumulative incidence rates of grades I-II and III-IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD at day 100 were 57.15% and 32.25%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> GVHD was seen in 21 of the 36 evaluable cases and ten of them were extensive type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Six patients relapsed and 27 dead, the overall survival at 5 years was 52.91% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The COX method analysis showed that HLA-compatible level and source of graft affected the incidence of aGVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The patients transplanted from HLA-matched donor with high resolution and PBSCT had the less probability for aGVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients without GVHD or with longer and intensive GVHD prophylaxis had significantly improved OS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The key to improvement the outcome of HCT from unrelated donor is to reduce the incidence and severity of aGVHD by selecting the HLA-matched donor, intensifying the immunosuppression at the early stage of transplantation </plain></SENT>
