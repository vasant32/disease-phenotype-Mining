<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Limited data are available regarding this complication following hyperfractionated radiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We undertook a retrospective analysis of thyroid function in 150 patients who received BMT at our institution, and who were alive and disease-free for at least 1 year after transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were 100 pediatric patients and 50 adult patients, with a median follow-up of 6.2 years for the whole group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> (n = 91) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0005558'>chronic leukemias</z:hpo> (n = 36), severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (n = 18) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> disorders (n = 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The majority of the patients received radiation-based cytoreductive regimens including 129 patients who received hyperfractionated total body irradiation (TBI) to a total dose of 1375 cGy or 1500 cGy and 10 patients who received total lymphoid irradiation (TLI) to a total dose of 600 cGy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty two patients of the cohort of 150 patients (14.7%) and 21 of the 139 patients (15.1%) who received hyperfractionated radiation were found to have developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000821'>hypothyroidism</z:hpo>, 11-88 months after transplant (median 49 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eight patients had received 1375 cGy and 12 patients 1500 cGy TBI, while one patient was treated with 600 cGy TLI and one patient was treated with chemotherapy only (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three patients had primary thyroid failure with an elevated TSH and a <z:hpo ids='HP_0000821'>low T4</z:hpo> index, while 19 patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0008223'>compensated hypothyroidism</z:hpo> with an elevated TSH but a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> T4 index </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Six of eight patients with untreated <z:hpo ids='HP_0008223'>compensated hypothyroidism</z:hpo> recovered spontaneously.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
