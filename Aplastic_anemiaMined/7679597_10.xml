<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Eighty-five patients who had undergone BMT for malignant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1533163" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">blood disease</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> at the Helsinki University Central Hospital, Finland were tested for <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> C antibodies (anti-HCV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eight (9.4%) patients were anti-HCV positive according to a second generation enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seven (87.5%) of the ELISA positive results could be confirmed by a supplemental test, the second generation recombinant immunoblot assay (RIBA-4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two patients were constantly seropositive, one patient was seropositive prior to BMT but became antibody negative soon after BMT, and four patients seroconverted after BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Six of the seven confirmed anti-HCV positive patients had biochemical evidence of liver damage, but none had <z:hpo ids='HP_0004787'>fulminant hepatitis</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001399'>hepatic failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Liver enzyme abnormalities consistent with a possible non-A, non-B <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> were significantly more prevalent among the seropositive than seronegative patients (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The intensive immunosuppression associated with BMT seemed to have little effect on the ability to produce antibodies for <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> C virus (HCV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The pattern of antibodies towards different HCV antigens in RIBA-4 was inconsistent, but the present results suggest that antibodies to a core antigen (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30081">C22</z:chebi>) may, in some cases, be detected earlier than other HCV antibodies during early HCV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, ELISA became positive earlier than RIBA-4 in some patients </plain></SENT>
