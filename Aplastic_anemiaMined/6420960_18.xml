<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two hundred thirty patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and seventy-eight patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> received allogeneic HLA-identical sibling marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> received syngeneic marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The conditioning regimen prior to marrow infusion consisted of 120 mg/kg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> and 9.2-15.75 Gy total-body irradiation (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>) or 200 mg/kg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients were skin-tested with the neoantigens <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34718">dinitrochlorobenzene</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="34718">DNCB</z:chebi>), keyhole limpet hemocyanin, and a battery of five recall antigens around 100, 150, 365, 730, 1095, 1460, and 1825 days after grafting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A binary logistic regression analysis was used to investigate the factors thought to influence immunocompetence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At 3 months postgrafting, the proportion of patients positive to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34718">DNCB</z:chebi> was equal to that of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> marrow donors, but thereafter it was lower until 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The proportion of patients positive to keyhole limpet hemocyanin was lower than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> regardless of the time after grafting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The proportion of patients positive to recall antigens was lower than that of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> marrow donors until 4 years after grafting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> had the lowest probability of a positive reaction to recall antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>None of the other factors was significantly associated with an increased or reduced level of response </plain></SENT>
