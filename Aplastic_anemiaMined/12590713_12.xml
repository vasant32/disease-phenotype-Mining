<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Stromal defects are part of the etiology of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (SAA), and hematopoietic engraftment is poor in unrelated and mismatched transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we wanted to find out whether human mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are partly of donor origin in patients with SAA years after successful bone marrow transplant (BMT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three SAA patients 3, 5, and 8 years after BMT (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, ATG) with bone marrow from an HLA-identical sibling donor of the opposite sex were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MSC were grown from patients' bone marrow aspirates according to Caplan et al </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The number of MSC that were isolated from SAA bone marrow post transplant was about 10 times lower than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Primary cultures of adherent MSC and passage-one cells were analyzed by dual-color interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis using centromere-specific DNA probes for X and Y chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>FISH did not show any clear evidence of donor cells in the adherent MSC: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases, less than 0.5% of nuclei showed a donor-type signal pattern that is well within assay limits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In a female patient, the absence of male donor cells was confirmed by sensitive and quantitative, Y chromosome-specific TaqMan PCR (QYCS-PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, Ficoll-separated hematopoietic cells from the same aspirates were greater than 90% of donor origin, as expected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In SAA, as previously found in patients with lysosomal and peroxisomal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0267971" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">storage disease</z:e>, bone marrow MSC remain host-derived despite successful hematopoietic engraftment years after allogeneic BMT </plain></SENT>
