<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis of AA was established in 238 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Results with different methods were listed below: (1) Typical picture of AA was found in bone marrow smear of 196 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The positive rate was 82.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>(2) Evaluation of marrow speckles might raise the positive rate to 89.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>(3) Diagnosis of AA in 103 out of 110 patients was confirmed with bone marrow biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The positive rate was 93.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>(4) Typical 3-dimensional marrow tissue structure of AA was found in 68 out of 72 patients under scanning electron microscope, with a positive rate of 94.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>(5) Total body bone marrow gamma-scintigraphy was performed in 56 patients; diagnosis of AA was reconfirmed in 54 patients with a positive rate of 96.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>(6) 4 or 5 diagnostic techniques were used simultaneously in 30 patients with a positive diagnostic rate of 100% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The methodology of different techniques of bone marrow examination, the typical picture of AA and the causes of missing diagnosis were discussed with certain recommendations on each technique </plain></SENT>
