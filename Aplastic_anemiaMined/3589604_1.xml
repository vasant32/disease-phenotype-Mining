<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the context of "lesion" production, the major radiation-elicited response sequences, the types and nature of measured end points, and governing temporal and radiobiological parameters are discussed and illustrated by using results derived from both in vitro cell systems and in vivo studies that measured tissue responses from various organ systems (respiratory, digestive, circulatory, and central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> systems) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Work in our laboratory on the nature of early and late hematopathologic tissue responses (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>) induced by protracted radiation exposure and the "bridging effect" of repair processes relative to the expression of these pathologies is highlighted </plain></SENT>
