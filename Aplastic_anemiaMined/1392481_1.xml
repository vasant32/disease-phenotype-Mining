<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Proliferation effects of total <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26605">saponins</z:chebi> of panax ginseng (TSPG) on hematopoietic progenitor cell in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals and 29 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) were observed by bone marrow culture of BFU-E, CFU-E, CFU-GM in vitro compared with methyltestosterone (MT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results showed that TSPG might prompt proliferation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> progenitor cells at the concentration of 20 micrograms/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The number of BFU-E, CFU-E and CFU-GM had increased by 37.8 +/- 2.9%, 31.4 +/- 2.9% and 33.3 +/- 4.0% over the controls respectively; furthermore TSPG was still useful to BFU-E, CFU-E growth without Epo in vitro, although the colony numbers were very lower </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Otherwise MT was useless to CFU-GM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>14 of the 29 patients with AA who responded to MT showed sensitivity to TSPG in marrow culture (the rising rate of colony formation exceeded 30%), but immune-mediated AA (patient's PBMNC suppressed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hematopoiesis) and stem cell-decreased AA (few of colony was formed) showed almost no expression for TSPG activity because of immunological suppression system and absence of progenitors </plain></SENT>
