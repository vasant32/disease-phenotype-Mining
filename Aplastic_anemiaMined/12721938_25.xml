<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied the prevalence of parvovirus B19 in liver-tissue samples from patients with FH and HAA and from control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the first study, parvovirus B19 DNA was detected by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in 4 of 15 livers from patients with FH and in 3 of 22 livers from patients with nonviral <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hepatic disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a second confirmatory study, livers were tested for parvovirus B19 and its variant erythroviruses, V9 and A6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Tissues were also tested by reverse-transcriptase PCR for the presence of parvovirus B19 transcripts as a marker of <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> replication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in the prevalence of parvovirus B19 DNA in livers from patients with FH or HAA, compared with liver-tissue samples from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> B virus (HBV) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> C virus (HCV) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>; parvovirus B19 transcripts were not detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a significant increase (P&lt;.1) in the prevalence of variant erythrovirus sequences in livers of patients with HBV or HCV <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo>, the reason for which is currently unknown </plain></SENT>
