<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> in the pediatric population has increased in the last 2 decades and represents a serious health concern, with potential impact on outcomes of hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied the effect of weight by age-adjusted body mass index (BMI) percentile in 1,281 pediatric patients (age 2-19 years) with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> who underwent HCT between 1990 and 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study population was divided into 5 weight groups-underweight, risk of underweight, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> BMI range, risk of overweight, and overweight-according to age-adjusted BMI percentiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional hazards regression models for survival and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (aGVHD), performed using weight groups as the main effect and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> BMI range (26th-75th percentile) as the baseline comparison, found higher mortality among overweight children (&gt;95th percentile adjusted for age) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Weight at transplantation did not increase the adjusted risk of grade III-IV aGVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 1-year and 2-year overall survival rates were 60% and 59% for overweight children, compared with &gt;70% in children with lower BMI at both time points (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Other significant factors associated with survival included race and region, donor type, conditioning regimens in related donor transplants, performance score, and year of transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, overweight children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> have worse outcomes after HCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The impact of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001513'>obesity</z:hpo> on survival outcomes in children should be discussed during pretransplantation counseling </plain></SENT>
