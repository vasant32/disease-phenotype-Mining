<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At present the treatment of choice is orthotopic whole-liver transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, allogeneic liver transplantation necessitates lifelong immunosuppressive therapy, which is associated with substantial risks to the patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Temporary auxiliary partial orthotopic liver transplantation has been developed recently as an alternative, enabling the native liver to regenerate while avoiding the risks of long-term immunosuppressive treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here we describe two cases of partial orthotopic liver transplantation in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Auxiliary partial orthotopic liver transplantation was performed in two boys (5 and 6 years old) suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0006554'>acute liver failure</z:hpo> of unknown origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The native left lateral liver lobes (segment II and II) were removed and replaced by left lateral liver grafts from young blood-group-compatible adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the first child the native liver, which was 80% necrotic at time of transplantation, showed regeneration within two weeks and the partially necrotic graft could be surgically removed on day 15 after auxiliary transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Four years after transplantation, the child is in excellent condition with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> liver function and does not require any treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the second case the native liver (90% necrotic at time of transplantation) regenerated within 6 weeks of transplantation, at which time the transplanted liver was removed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The patient developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and died 2 months after transplantation from candida <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The conclusion was that auxiliary partial liver transplantation in childhood provides a valuable option to maintain liver function in <z:hpo ids='HP_0006554'>acute liver failure</z:hpo> until functional recovery of the native liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The main advantage over whole-liver transplantation is the chance to avoid lifelong immunosuppression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, there is a higher surgical risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Therefore, auxiliary transplantation should be considered carefully in every case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006554'>acute liver failure</z:hpo> in children </plain></SENT>
