<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: We previously reported that patients with acquired severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (SAA) treated with antilymphocyte globulin (ALG), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50366">6-methylprednisolone</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> (CyA) and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) can mobilize peripheral blood hemopoietic progenitors (PBHP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to assess phenotypic and functional properties of these PBHP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied seven patients who underwent 43 leukophereses (median 5) between day +30 and +80 following ALG, while in treatment with CyA and G-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mobilized peripheral blood hemopoietic progenitors were analyzed using surface markers, conventional assays for clonogenic cells (CFU-GM, BFU-E, CFU-GEMM) as well as the recently developed assay for long-term culture initiating cells (LTC-ICs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The proportion of CD34+ cells ranged between 0% and 5.4% (median 0.3%), CD34+DR between 0% and 3.5% (median 0.1%) and CD8+ cells between 3.3% and 56% (median 31%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When light density mononuclear cells (MNC) were plated in vitro, we could grow colony-forming units-granulo-macrophage (CFU-GM) (range 0-45/10(5) MNC; <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls 21-200/10(5) MNC), burst-forming units-erythroid (BFU-E) (range 0-5/10(5) MNC; <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls 0-6/10(5) MNC), multipotent colonies (CFU-GEMM) (range 0-3/10(5) MNC; <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls 0-6/10(5) MNC) and high proliferative potential colony-forming cells (HPP-CFC) (range 0-3.4/10(5) MNC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We studied long-term culture-initiating cells (LTC-ICs) in 18 leukophereses from 4 patients; in 7/18 samples LTC-ICs were grown at low frequency (range 0.4-2/10(6) MNC) (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls 5-130/10(6) MNC), and in one patient in the absence of CFU-GM growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The total yield of LTC-ICs in two patients was 7.64 and 10.5 x 10(2)/kg of body weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that cells with the phenotype and in vitro function of early hemopoietic progenitors are found, though in small numbers, in the peripheral blood of patients with SAA after treatment with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressants</z:chebi> and prolonged G-CSF administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Whether G-CSF-mobilized progenitors contribute to hemopoietic recovery in these patients remains to be determined </plain></SENT>
