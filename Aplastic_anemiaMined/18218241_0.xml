<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Enrolled into the present study were 51 idiopathic AA patients treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> A (CsA) based IST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>BM CD(8)(+) T lymphocyte intracellular IFNgamma was determined with flow cytometry and HLA-DRB1*1501 detected with PCR-sequence specific primer before treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The relationship between laboratory indices and clinical response were investigated and the potential usefulness of parameters in predicting the response to IST for AA was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: These HLA-DRB1*1501 shows sensitivity of 45.7% (16/35) and specificity of 87.5% (14/16) respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intracellular IFNgamma has sensitivity of 94.3% (33/35) and specificity of 62.5% (10/16), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>With combination of intracellular IFNgamma with HLA-DRB1*1501, the parallel test increases the sensitivity of 97.1% (34/35) and the negative predictive value of 90.0% (9/10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the serial test improves the specificity and positive predictive value which both achieve 93.7% (15/16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It could be calculated through a logistic regression equation that the probabilities of prediction of four subgroups of patients whose results are both positive reaction, a positive intracellular IFNgamma plus negative HLA-DRB1*1501, a negative intracellular IFNgamma plus positive HLA-DRB1*1501 and both negative reaction are 89.0%, 77.4%, 34.5% and 18.2%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Combination of BM T cells intracellular IFNgamma stain and HLA-DRB1*1501 phenotype can be a useful predictor for AA patients in immunosuppressive therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The patients with both positive results of the two tests may have more possibilities to response to IST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It may have an important implication for the majority of AA patients whose intracellular IFNgamma stain has a positive reaction </plain></SENT>
