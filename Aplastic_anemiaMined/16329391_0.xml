<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On this model the possibility of correction of oxygen transport system damages was studied with the help of the standard experimental therapy (ET) and hypoxic training (HT) in three ranges of tests: I range--preventive application HT, before the establishment of AA; II--the application HT during modeling AA; Ill--HT during implementing ET </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Final results show positive effects of preventive application HT and HT during ET on the restoration of oxygen transport system in AA </plain></SENT>
