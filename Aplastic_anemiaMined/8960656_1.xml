<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One unrelated donor patient with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> died without evidence of engraftment </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the probability of survival without grade III-IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD was similar in the two groups, 62% (n = 21) vs. 65% (n = 75), and there was no significant difference in relapse-free survival, good prognostic factors; 76% (n = 11) vs. 66% (n = 37), higher risk factors; 30% (n = 11) vs. 31% (n = 21) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that bone marrow transplantation for patients younger than 30 years old from unrelated donors should be considered equally to sibling donors with great care to engraftment for severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, grade III-IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD and <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
