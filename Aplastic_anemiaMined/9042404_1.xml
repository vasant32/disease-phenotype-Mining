<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hypersensitivity to X-rays was seen both in G0 as well as in G2 phase of the cell cycle in lymphocytes from AA and <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> patients, confirming our earlier findings using micronucleus (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi>) and G2 radiosensitivity (AA) assays </plain></SENT>
