<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using a sequential double-immunostaining technique, a morphometric analysis was performed on routinely processed bone marrow biopsies derived from 70 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was, firstly, to determine the frequency of bone marrow macrophages in a variety of lesions and, secondly, to elucidate whether there is any proliferative activity detectable by immunohistochemical markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow pathology included reactive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026975" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myelitis</z:e> (RM), secondary aplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> (AP), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0002196'>myelopathy</z:hpo>, primary (idiopathic) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948968" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">osteomyelofibrosis</z:e> (OMF) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The monoclonal antibody PG-M1 which recognizes a formalin-resistant <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> on macrophages and PC10 raised against proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) were employed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For comparison with the PCNA-labelling index, the newly developed monoclonal antibody Ki-S1, which is associated with cell proliferation, was applied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In comparison with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow, morphometric evaluation revealed a significant increase in macrophages in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, OMF, RM and especially in HIV-infected patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, a positive immunostaining of single macrophages with PC10 was noted very infrequently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This rather inconspicuous PCNA labelling increased in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>By contrast, Ki-S1 expression was found in none of the other pathologies studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of the macrophage population in certain disorders may have a multifactorial origin, such as inflammatory changes like intercurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> and enhanced cell turnover in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> as well as involvement of the complex pathomechanisms generating bone marrow <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In keeping with previous studies, the insignificant PCNA expression of macrophages should not be related to cell proliferation, but to unscheduled DNA strand repair which may be generated in the course of <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
