<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Unclassified inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> syndromes are a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> group of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic disorders</z:e> that represent either new syndromes or atypical clinical courses of known inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The relative prevalence of the unclassified inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> syndromes and their characteristics and the clinical and economic challenges that they create have never been studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed cases of inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> syndrome in the Canadian Inherited Marrow Failure Registry that were deemed unclassifiable at study entry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From October 2001 to March 2006, 39 of the 162 patients enrolled in the Canadian Inherited Marrow Failure Registry were registered as having unclassified inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These patients presented at a significantly older age (median: 9 months) than the patients with classified inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> syndrome (median: 1 month) and had substantial variation in the clinical presentations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The hematologic phenotype, however, was similar to the classified inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> syndromes and included single- or multiple-lineage cytopenia, severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Grouping patients according to the affected blood cell lineage(s) and to the presence of associated physical malformations was not always sufficient to characterize a condition, because affected members from several families fit into different phenotypic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with the classified inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> syndromes, the patients with unclassified inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> syndromes had 3.2 more specific diagnostic tests at 4.5 times higher cost per evaluated patient to attempt to categorize their syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At last follow-up, only 20% of the unclassified inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> syndromes were ultimately diagnosed with a specific syndrome on the basis of the development of new clinical findings or positive genetic tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Unclassified inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> syndromes are relatively common among the inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> syndromes and present a major diagnostic and therapeutic dilemma </plain></SENT>
