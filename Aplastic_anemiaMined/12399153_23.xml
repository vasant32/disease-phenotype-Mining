<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Evidence is presented showing that idiosyncratic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAID</z:chebi> drugs form prooxidant radicals when metabolised by peroxidases known to be present in these tissues </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During GSH and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16908">NADH</z:chebi> cooxidation, oxygen uptake and activation occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore the formation of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAID</z:chebi> oxidation products was prevented during the cooxidation indicating that the cooxidation involved redox cycling of the first formed <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAID</z:chebi> radical product </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The order of prooxidant catalytic effectiveness of fenamate and arylacetic acid <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35475">NSAIDs</z:chebi> was mefenamic acid&gt;tolfenamic acid&gt;<z:chebi fb="0" ids="42638">flufenamic acid</z:chebi>, meclofenamic acid or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47381">diclofenac</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
