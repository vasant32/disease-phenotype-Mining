<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The molecular mechanism by which <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> damages hematopoietic cells is unclear; in particular, <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi>-induced aberrant gene expression has not been addressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analyzed differential gene expression in the peripheral white blood cells from seven female patients with occupational <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> poisoning and seven matched control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we report altered expression of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38559">cytochrome P450</z:chebi> in the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients exhibited elevated expression of CYP4F3A encoding the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15647">leukotriene B4</z:chebi> (LTB(4)) omega-hydroxylase critical in the inactivation of LTB(4) in polymorphonuclear leukocytes with a -fold induction between 3 and 71 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four patients had high expression of CYP1A1, and two patients had elevated expression of CYP1B1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Expressions of CYP2B6, CYP51, and CYP27A1 were also altered in certain patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mechanistic analysis revealed that <z:chebi fb="43" ids="15882">phenol</z:chebi>, a major metabolite of <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi>, significantly induced the expression of CYP4F3A at both <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein levels in cultured promyelocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cells (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60), similarly to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-trans <z:chebi fb="2" ids="26536">retinoic acid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Induction of CYP4F3 by <z:chebi fb="43" ids="15882">phenol</z:chebi> was also observed in differentiated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60 cells, in the proerythroid cell line K562, and ex vivo in human neutrophils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17594">hydroquinone</z:chebi> induced extensive <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of the cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The findings demonstrated, for the first time, that <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> and metabolites induce CYP4F3 in human blood cells both in vivo and in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Induction of CYP4F3 may play a role in the development of <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> hematotoxicity and serve as a biomarker of <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> exposure </plain></SENT>
