<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The oxidation phenomena and/or the formation of free radicals has been suggested to be causally related to various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0947743,C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematological disorders</z:e>, e.g., <z:mp ids='MP_0000334'>agranulocytosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using five experimental conditions, we tested the oxidative potential of compounds with and without a history of hematological side effects, e.g., <z:mp ids='MP_0000334'>agranulocytosis</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A statistical analysis was undertaken for each experimental condition and a multivariate analysis combining <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> results was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two peroxidase-induced free radical models did not successfully discriminate between drugs with and without a history of causing hematologic problems (&lt;70%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> peroxidation system provided even less satisfactory discrimination, with only 56.25% correct classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, an 87.5% correct classification was obtained when using the oxidation potentials of these drugs determined at pH 4.7 and at pH 7.4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A multivariate analysis taking into account the five variables provided 87.5% success in classification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The two clusters were better discriminated in terms of a "distance coefficient." In a second analysis, the putative antipsychotic pyridobenzodiazepine analogues (JL5, JL8, JL18, and JL25) were classified in the cluster of toxic compounds, while the oxa- and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48893">thiazepine</z:chebi> analogues (JL2, JL3, and JL13) were classified as nontoxic compounds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, a few metabolites of <z:chebi fb="35" ids="3766">clozapine</z:chebi> and fluperlapine were classified in the toxic compound group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The procedure described herein is, to our knowledge, the first which classifies molecules of different structures as well as different pharmacological profiles according to their hematotoxic potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Such a procedure could be used to predict drug-induced hematological side effects </plain></SENT>
