<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We used X-chromosome methylation patterns to study clonality in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004818'>paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AA is usually not considered to be a clonal stem cell disorder, although this has not been directly investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> is generally assumed to be a clonal disorder, although there is contradictory evidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Methylation analysis was performed on DNA from separated granulocytes and mononuclear cells, using the M27 beta and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17368">hypoxanthine</z:chebi> phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT) probes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Six of seven AA patients showed a polyclonal pattern of X inactivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, five of five <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> patients showed a monoclonal pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results imply that at least 80% of the cell population derives from a single stem cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Because this high proportion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> cells might be considered surprising, three patients were studied for membrane expression of decay accelerating factor (DAF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In support of the DNA data, more than 95% of the granulocytes were DAF--ve in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that AA is predominantly a polyclonal disorder, whereas <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> is a clonal stem cell disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our data support a model in which a single <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> stem cell has a growth advantage over other remaining stem cells and eventually dominates hematopoiesis </plain></SENT>
