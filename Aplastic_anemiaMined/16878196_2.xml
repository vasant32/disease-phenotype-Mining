<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE: Acquired fetal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbF) elevation has been implicated as a prognostic factor in dyserythropoietic disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our objectives were to examine acquired HbF increases in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004818'>paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>) patients, and to evaluate whether there is an association between the presence of XmnI and 5' hypersensitive site locus control region (LCR-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30604,30605">HS2</z:chebi>) polymorphisms and the HbF levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND SETTING: Cross-sectional study at the Hematology and Blood Transfusion Service of Universidade Federal de SÃ£o Paulo - Escola Paulista de Medicina </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied a group of 37 patients with AA and/or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and enzymatic digestion were utilized to analyze XmnI polymorphisms; and PCR, cloning and automated sequencing for the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30604,30605">HS2</z:chebi> polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The mean HbF level was 2.32%, but there was no significant difference in HbF level between the AA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> groups (p = 0.46) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>HbF levels of less than 1.0% showed a significant correlation with absence of the XmnI (+) polymorphism (p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The presence of the XmnI allele was greater in the AA group (p = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: XmnI polymorphism absence reduction is associated with acquired HbF elevation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further studies are required to confirm these observations and make treatment, prognosis and survival comparisons </plain></SENT>
