<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024291" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis</z:e> (HLH) is associated with hypercytokinemia in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although HLH can be also observed after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), the incidence and clinical features of HLH after HSCT remain obscure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PROCEDURE: The clinical features of HLH after HSCT (post-HSCT HLH) were investigated in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immune deficiencies</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The HLH/<z:mpath ids='MPATH_653'>Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LCH</z:e>) Committee of the Japanese Society of Pediatric Hematology (JSPH) sent questionnaires to hospitals with JPSH members asking for details of cases in which HLH occurred after HSCT between 1998 and 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 42 children who were diagnosed with post-HSCT HLH between 1998 and 2008 in Japan, 37 fulfilled our inclusion criteria; of these, 26 were classified as early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> &lt;30 days after HSCT) and 11 were classified as <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late-onset</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> &gt;30 days after HSCT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> group, the presence of respiratory symptoms, high levels of total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="4" ids="17855">triglycerides</z:chebi> at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and the lack of control of GVHD with tacrolimus were significantly associated with non-resolution of HLH (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The survival rate was significantly higher in patients with resolution of HLH than in those without resolution (59% vs. 14%, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that early-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> post-HSCT HLH is a specific entity of HLH, and appropriate diagnosis and prompt management need to be established </plain></SENT>
