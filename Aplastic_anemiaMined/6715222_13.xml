<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To summarize, concern has developed over the extra-label use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17698">chloramphenicol</z:chebi> in food-producing animals because a type of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">blood dyscrasia</z:e> that is usually fatal to a significant subgroup of the population with an apparent predisposed sensitivity to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17698">chloramphenicol</z:chebi> has been associated with extremely low levels of exposure to the drug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a monitoring program, using a method of analysis that is limited as to the type of residues it can detect, USDA has found 4 to 8 animals a year that were slaughtered for use as human food that contained residue levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17698">chloramphenicol</z:chebi> that approach or exceed those concentrations associated in a causal relationship with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> in man </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Given the preponderance of evidence presented above, the FDA must consider--under its mandate to protect the human health by assuring safe and effective veterinary drugs--a course of action that will preclude the availability and the use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17698">chloramphenicol</z:chebi> in food animals </plain></SENT>
