<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>UNLABELLED: BACKGROUND Very severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> is characterized by a <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>hypoplastic bone marrow</z:hpo> due to destruction of CD34(+) stem cells by autoreactive T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Investigation of the pathomechanism by patient-specific gene expression analysis of the attacked stem cells has previously been impractical because of the scarcity of these cells at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: Employing unbiased <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> amplification, patient-specific gene expression profiling was carried out for CD34(+) cells from patients newly diagnosed with very severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (n=13), <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (n=8) and healthy controls (n=10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These data were compared to profiles of myelodysplastic disease (n=55), including <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (n=18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To identify possible targets of autoimmune attack, presence of autoreactive antibodies was tested in pre-therapeutic sera of patients with very severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (n=19) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CD34(+) gene expression profiling distinguished between healthy controls, children with aplastic or <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> and clonal disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interferon stimulated genes such as the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> inducing <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> ligand TRAIL were strongly up-regulated in CD34(+) cells of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, in particular in patients responding to immunosuppressive treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of integrin GPVI and the integrin complexes GPIa/IIa, GPIIb/IIIa, GPIB/GPIX/GPV was significantly down-regulated and corresponding antibodies were detected in 7 of 11 profiled patients and in 11 of 19 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS As a potential diagnostic tool, patient-specific gene expression profiling of CD34(+) stem cells made it possible to make the difficult differential diagnosis of most patients with aplastic and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Profiling indicated a prognostic correlation of TRAIL expression and patient benefit from immunosuppressive therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Downregulation of integrin expression and concurrent presence of autoreactive anti-integrin-antibodies suggested a previously unrecognized pathological role of integrins in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
