<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expressions of EPO, SCF and GM-CSF from 35 CAA patients and 10 healthy individuals were detected by semi-quantitative RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the levels of EPO, SCF and GM-CSF in CAA patients were obviously lower than those in the healthy individuals (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the immunity disorder mediated by hematopoietic cytokines is one of the pathogenesis in the CAA patients, it provided theoretical basis for guiding clinical treatment </plain></SENT>
