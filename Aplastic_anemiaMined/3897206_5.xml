<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow transplantation results in the infusion of 150 to 360 ml of erythrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While this poses no problem to a recipient of marrow from an ABO-compatible donor, it clearly represents a serious risk of intravascular <z:mp ids='MP_0010163'>hemolysis</z:mp> for the recipient of an ABO-incompatible marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, there is a need for removing incompatible erythrocytes from the marrow preparation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We removed erythrocytes from the marrow preparations by automated centrifugation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The erythrocyte-depleted marrow (EDM) contained a mean of 5 ml erythrocytes, representing an average reduction of 98% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean mononuclear cell recovery was 88%, resulting in a mean infusion of 0.6 X 10(8) cells/Kg of recipient's body weight in a final average volume of 155 ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>EDM was infused into 22 ABO-incompatible marrow recipients (21 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> and one patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>) without clinical evidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0010163'>hemolysis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The isohemagglutinin titers of recipients ranged from 4 to 4096 and were not lowered prior to infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Engraftment (i.e., recovery of peripheral leukocyte and platelet counts) and incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft versus host disease</z:e> were similar to those observed in recipients of ABO-compatible marrow transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Erythrocyte engraftment was significantly delayed in only one patient who had a high isohemagglutinin titer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The post-transplantation red cell requirement was increased in EDM recipients: 9 units compared to 6 units in ABO-compatible bone marrow transplanted patients with neither <z:mp ids='MP_0010163'>hemolysis</z:mp> nor interference with successful engraftment </plain></SENT>
