<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease after bone marrow (BM) transplantation is often associated with BM graft failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are two possible reasons for such a correlation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>First, a poor hematopoietic reconstitution of unrelated etiology could promote the progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010823" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">CMV infection</z:e> by the lack of immune control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010823" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">CMV infection</z:e> could interfere with the engraftment of donor BM cells in recipient BM stroma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Evidence for a causative role of CMV in BM <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> came from studies in long-term BM cultures and from the murine in vivo model of CMV-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A deficiency in the expression of essential stromal hemopoietins, such as stem cell factor (SCF), has indicated a functional insufficiency of the stromal microenvironment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It remained open to question whether CMV mediates a negative regulation of hemopoietin gene expression (the downregulation model) or whether it causes the default of a positive regulator (the lack-of-induction model) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further, even though implicitly assumed, it has never been formally documented that CMV directly interferes with the engraftment of a BM cell transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We addressed these problems in a murine model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010823" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">CMV infection</z:e> after experimental male-into-female BM transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The data indicate that the downregulation model applies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Quantitation of the male-sex-determining gene tdy demonstrated an impaired engraftment of donor BM cells in the BM stroma of the female recipients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This graft failure was reflected by a diminished population of SCF-receptor-expressing hematopoietic progenitor cells and correlated with a reduced level of stromal SCF gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, high doses of BM cells protected against stromal insufficiency by a mechanism unrelated to control of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
