<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Two cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030781" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">peliosis hepatis</z:e>, treated with a large dose of predonine for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo>, respectively, were reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Case 1 showed no <z:hpo ids='HP_0002910'>abnormal liver function</z:hpo>, but, in Case 2 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002240'>hepatomegaly</z:hpo>, retention of ICG, and elevation of LDH level despite the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> serum transaminase were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In both cases, peliotic lesions were incidentally observed at autopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In Case 1, the lesion was localized in the right lobe only, but, in Case 2 the lesion was present throughout the entire lobes of the liver involving also a part of the spleen and bone marrow of the sternum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Innumerable blood-filled cavities were surrounded by incomplete reticulin or injured hepatocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In smaller lesions observed in Case 1, focal <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0087086" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombi</z:e> were prominent features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, in extensive lesions, as in Case 2, a marked liver cell dissociation with sequent irregular reticulin arrangement was present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Though the etiology and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030781" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">peliosis hepatis</z:e> is still uncertain in these cases, it was assumed that a large dose of predonine might have some correlation to the occurrence </plain></SENT>
