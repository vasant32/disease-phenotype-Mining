<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This caused an erroneous diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> to be made in the first case and inappropriate therapy to be administered for three months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The second of these cases provided an unusual opportunity to study human erythrocyte precursor dynamics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serial bone marrow aspirates, obtained after institution of treatment with a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi>, revealed an initial increase in labeled lymphocytes, a concomitant decrease in their number, and the subsequent appearance of erythroid elements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that cells classified morphologically as lymphocytes may serve as erythroid precursors in human beings </plain></SENT>
