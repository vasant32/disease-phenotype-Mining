<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Severe acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (SAA) is a potentially fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> syndrome occurring mainly in children and young adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Immunosuppressive regimens and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) are the only two available curative treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients who lack an HLA-identical sibling donor may receive HSCT from an unrelated donor, a strategy historically associated with high mortality rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, for patients refractory to immunosuppressive regimens, the decision to transplant stem cells from unrelated donors is weighed against supportive care and often represents a dilemma for physicians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We aimed to determine whether outcome after unrelated HSCT has improved in recent years and, if so, to determine the factors responsible for the improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: We analyzed the outcome of 89 patients (median age 17 years, range 0-52) with acquired SAA undergoing HSCT from an unrelated donor between 1989 and 2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cases were consecutively reported to the French Registry (SFGM-TC) by 25 centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients transplanted during two successive time-periods (1989-1998 and 1999-2004) had different 5-year survival probabilities (+/-95% confidence interval): 29%+/-7% and 50%+/-7%, respectively (p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The main difference between the two cohorts concerned HLA matching between donors and recipients at the allelic level for the ten HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1 and -DQB1 antigens, which was more frequent in 1999-2004 than in the former period (p=0.0004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, the only two factors affecting survival were HLA allelic matching (p&lt;0.01) and younger age of recipient (17 pounds sterling years, p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Survival reached 78%+/-11% at 5 years for the younger, fully HLA-matched patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Survival after unrelated HSCT for SAA has improved significantly over the past 15 years, mainly due to better HLA matching </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Results for young patients who are fully HLA-matched at the allelic level with their donor are comparable to those observed after HSCT from a related donor </plain></SENT>
