<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty clean-class BALB/c female mice were intraperitoneally injected with IFN-γ and intragastrically administrated with busulphan (group I), meanwhile busulphan alone group (n = 30, group II) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control group (n = 30, group III) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Multi-parameters were compared among the three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In group I at day 10 after treatment, the incidence of SAA was 100% and mortality 20% respectively; the WBC, HGB, PLT, absolute reticulocyte count (Ret) and tibial nucleated cell count (TNCC) were (0.8 ± 0.3) × 10(9)/L, (45 ± 20) g/L, (10 ± 8) × 10(9)/L, (15.2 ± 10.2) × 10(9)/L, (12 ± 7) × 10(6)/tibia, respectively, which were significantly different from the other two groups (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The bone marrow smears and patho-histological examinations showed marked reductions of marrow cell proliferation, and increases of the percentages of non-hematopoietic cells and cellular adipose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> was severe and irreversible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In group II, the blood cells count, TNCC and marrow proliferation recovered gradually with <z:hpo ids='HP_0012132'>erythroid hyperplasia</z:hpo> and hematopoietic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: IFN-γ plus busulphan can establish a SAA mouse model in a relatively short period, which is more resemble with human SAA </plain></SENT>
