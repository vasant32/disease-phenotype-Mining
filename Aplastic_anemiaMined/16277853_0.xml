<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results showed that MSCs could be isolated and expanded from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> patient BM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MSCs derived from BM of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> patients shared a similar <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and phenotype with derived MSCs from BM of fetuses and children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, in vitro proliferation capacity of MSCs derived from BM of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> patients after 20 population doublings (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>) was significantly lower, compared with MSCs from BM of fetuses and children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>BM MSCs derived from children and fetuses proliferated for more than 30 PD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that BM MSCs from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> patients appears to be <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in phenotype but their proliferation capacity is lower in comparison with control groups </plain></SENT>
