<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five patients who received bone marrow transplantation (BMT) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> granulocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CGL</z:e>), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> were studied before and after BMT in order to document and characterize the events following transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DNA analysis was performed using minisatellite probes, which give rise to extremely polymorphic Southern blot band patterns specific to each individual and are regarded as "genetic fingerprint." Sensitivity studies using a mixture of donor and recipient cells could distinguish the presence of 1% of cells from one individual </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Blood specimens were obtained from donor recipient before BMT and at days 10, 30, 90, and 270 after BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Karyotype analysis was also performed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CGL</z:e> patients at the same time of DNA analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Engraftment was identified by DNA analysis as early as 10 days posttransplant and correlated with cytogenetic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This confirmed that a single hybridization filter is informative in 100% of patients and is easily applicable for early and long term studies of chimerism in BM transplanted patients </plain></SENT>
