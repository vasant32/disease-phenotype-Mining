<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To evaluate this treatment, data on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with LTx after allo-SCT ever performed in Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Finland were recorded and compared with survival data from the Scandiatransplant registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In total, LTx after allo-SCT had been performed in 13 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Allo-SCT was done because of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (n=6), <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> (n=3), ALL (n=2), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> (n=1) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (n=1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> developed clinical cGVHD, with median interval from allo-SCT to LTx of 8.2 (0.7-16) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median age at LTx was 34 (16-55) years, and the median postoperative observation time was 4.2 (0.1-15) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two patients died, one due to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_681'>septicemia</z:mpath>, the other of relapsing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, after 2 and 14 months, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BOS</z:e>, one of these was retransplanted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The survival did not significantly differ from the survival in matched LTx controls, being 90% 1 year and 75% 5 years after LTx compared with 85% and 68% in the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We therefore suggest that LTx may be considered in carefully selected patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">BOS</z:e> due to cGVHD after allo-SCT </plain></SENT>
