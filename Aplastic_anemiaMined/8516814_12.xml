<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The significance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> C in kidney transplant recipients is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of antibodies to <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> C among candidates for transplantation is up to 50% in some centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We screened 640 frozen serum samples obtained pretransplantation from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> kidney recipients at the Medical College of Wisconsin between January 1979 and March 1990 for antibody to <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> C using the second generation immunoassay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Charts were reviewed from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> C antibody-positive (anti-HCV+) patients and 256 randomly chosen <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> C antibody negative (anti-HCV-) controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Actuarial patient and graft survival in these two groups were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The prevalence of anti-HCV was 8.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Blacks and i.v. drug users were disproportionately represented in the anti-HCV+ group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the anti-HCV+ patients, 18.9% developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> independent of race </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Black anti-HCV+ patients had a 5-year graft survival of 28 +/- 11% compared to 67 +/- 7% in black anti-HCV- patients (P = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Black anti-HCV-, white anti-HCV-, and white anti-HCV+ patients <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had similar graft survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Anti-HCV was not a poor prognostic indicator for overall patient survival or the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001402'>hepatocellular carcinoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Anti-HCV is a significant risk factor for reduced kidney graft survival in blacks apart from i.v. <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013146" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">drug abuse</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Black anti-HCV- patients had graft survival similar to white transplant recipients, indicating that anti-HCV may be one marker for the poorer graft survival in blacks that has been observed in most transplant programs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Anti-HCV in kidney transplant recipients increases the risk for the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> post-transplant </plain></SENT>
