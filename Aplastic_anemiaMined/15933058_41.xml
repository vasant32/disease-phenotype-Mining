<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Autologous T lymphocytes are thought to cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> by immune-mediated excessive <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of stem and progenitor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The disease is subclassified into a severe (neutrophil count, &gt; 0.2 x 10(9)/L [&gt; 200/microL]) and a very severe (&lt; 0.2 x 10(9)/L [&lt; 200/microL]) (vSAA) form </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report the results of a prospective multicenter trial with a combined immunosuppressive regimen of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> (CSA), anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) and, in cases with neutrophil counts fewer than 0.5 x 10(9)/L (&lt; 500/microL), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) for treatment of SAA in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Children with vSAA showed a higher rate of complete response than did children with SAA (68% versus 45%; P = .009), as well as better survival (93% versus 81%; P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, in children with SAA a more severe disease stage at diagnosis indicates a favorable outcome with immunosuppressive therapy </plain></SENT>
