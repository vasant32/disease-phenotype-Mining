<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The study was aimed to compare the effects of T-cell suppression mediated by mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MSC were cultured from the bone marrow of 12 healthy volunteers and 12 MDS patients, the <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, surface markers and expression of several cytokines of MSC from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients were compared, and the effects of T-cell suppression were tested in the following assays: phytohemaglutinin (PHA)-primed cultures, mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR), cell cycle of T-cell after PHA-primed cultures and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of T-cell as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the MSC from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients were similar in <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, proliferation and surface markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The suppressions of T-cell proliferation induced by PHA and alloantigens mediated by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-MSC were significantly lower than that of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> MSC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>More T-cells were arrested in G0/G1 phase by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> MSC, while the effects were deficient by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-MSC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The suppression of T-cell activation mediated by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-MSC was also lower than that of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> MSC, but suppression effect on T-cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cytokines TGF-beta1, 3, FasL expressed by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-MSC were reduced as compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> MSC, but TGF-beta2 expression increased in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-MSC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that although the <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, proliferation and cell surface markers of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-MSC are <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, the T-cell suppression mediated by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>-MSC is deficient as compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Whether these abnormalities are relevant to the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> remains to be determined </plain></SENT>
