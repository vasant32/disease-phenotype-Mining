<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>Aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) is characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow hypoplasia</z:hpo>, which results from immune-mediated hematopoiesis suppression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Understanding the pathophysiology of the immune system, particularly T cells immunity, has led to improved AA treatment over the past decades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, primary and secondary failure after immunosuppressive therapy is frequent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, knowledge of the immune mechanisms leading to AA is crucial to fundamentally understand the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FINDINGS: To elucidate the T cell receptor (TCR) signal transduction features in AA, the expression levels of CD3γ, δ, ε and ζ chain and FcεRIγ genes, which are involved in TCR signal transduction, and the negative correlation of the expression levels between the CD3ζ and FcεRIγ genes in T cells from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Real-time RT-PCR using the SYBR Green method was used to detect the expression level of these genes in PBMCs from 18 patients with AA and 14 healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The β2microglobulin gene (β2M) was used as an endogenous reference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The expression levels of the CD3γ, CD3δ, CD3ε and CD3ζ genes in patients with AA were significantly increased compared to a healthy control group, whereas the FcεRIγ gene expression level was significantly decreased in patients with AA in comparison with the healthy control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the negative correlation of the expression levels between the CD3ζ and FcεRIγ genes was lost </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first report of the CD3γ, CD3δ, CD3ε, CD3ζ and FcεRIγ gene expression in patients with AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The abnormally expressed TCR signaling related genes may relate to <z:hpo ids='HP_0005435'>T cells dysfunction</z:hpo> in AA </plain></SENT>
