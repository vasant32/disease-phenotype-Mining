<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to review the current results, the literature prior to September, 1982 was surveyed and data were tabulated for each transplant center regarding the number of patients receiving transplants, diagnoses, cytoreducation regimen, clinical status, revission duration, relapse rate, causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and incidence of interstitial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The incidence and severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000518'>cataracts</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001510'>growth failure</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000821'>hypothyroidism</z:hpo> and second malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> were noted, and the data obtained from the literature search were updated and expanded by telephone questionnaire when possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Marked variation in the technique of transplantation was found among the participating institutions, making it difficult to determine the contribution of the various TBI doses, dose rates and fractionation schedules to the efficacy and toxicity of the combined regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In order to define the risk-benefit ratio of the various TBI regimens more clearly, prospective controlled, randomized studies will be required </plain></SENT>
