<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Plasma from one unit of blood was perfused through the columns and returned to each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This procedure was performed once or twice weekly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In two cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi>, platelets markedly increased, and platelet-associated IgG (Pa-IgG) and circulating immune complexes (CIC) were decreased following the treatments </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two mechanisms are suggested for the effect of protein A column therapy: one is the stimulation of the production of anti-idiotype antibody that neutralizes platelet auto-antibody and the other is activation of complement that induces solubilization and removal of CIC containing platelet autoantibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunoadsorption by protein A column is a useful therapy for some <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> cases, especially those that are <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
