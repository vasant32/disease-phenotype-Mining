<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Many adverse factors including social and economic limitations may reduce the overall results of this complex and expensive procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to characterize the most important clinical, social and economic features of candidates for transplantation and their potential donors as well as the influence of these factors on overall survival in a retrospective and exploratory analysis at a university hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From July 1993 to July 2001, candidates for BMT were referred to the Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit by Hematology and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> Centers from several regions of Brazil </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 1138 patients were referred to us as candidates for alloBMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median age was 25 years (range: 2 months-60 years), 684 (60.1%) were males and 454 (39.9%) were females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The clinical indications were severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>From the total of 1138 patients, 923 had HLA-typing; 497/923 (53.8%) candidates had full match donors; 352/1138 (30.8%) were eligible for alloBMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only 235 of 352 (66.7%) were transplanted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Schooling was 1st to 8th grade for 123/235 (52.3%); monthly family income ranged from US$60 (7%) to more than US$400 (36%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Overall survival for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> was 58, 60 and 30%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus, overall survival rates for the most frequent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematological diseases</z:e> were similar to those reported in the International Registry, except for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This descriptive and exploratory analysis suggests the feasibility of alloBMT in a developing country like Brazil </plain></SENT>
