<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The peripheral blood (PB) lymphocyte chromosome fragility sensitive to <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi> and unstability was also analysed in 18 FDRs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The abnormal BM megakaryocystic/erythroid cellularity and the rearrangement of c-erbB were found in 66%-86.1% of parents and siblings of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The associations of dysplastic megakaryopoiesis, including the presence of lymphoid small megakaryocytes, with the chromosomal <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> or/and the rearrangement/amplification of C-erbB, were found in a few parents and siblings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results were consistent with those of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, Fanconi <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>Anemia</z:hpo> (FA) and AL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype and SCD positive of BM cells and PB lymphocytes, and PB lymphocyte chromosomal fragility and unstability were found in most of patients' parents, while familial chromosomal <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> of BM cells and PB lymphocyte chromosomal fragility were found in parents and siblings of familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Based on the studies of a large family with 7 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> erythroleukamia and relative myeloleukemias in three consecutive generations and a family with 3 CAA and 1 AML, the rearrangement of c-erbB might be inherited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The rearrangement/amplification of c-erbB and its PCR detected results could be the indicators of gene diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026986,C0033027" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">preleukemia</z:e> and might be useful in genetic conselling of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The common origin of AL, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and AA was discussed </plain></SENT>
