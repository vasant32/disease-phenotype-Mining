<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: This was a retrospective study involving 30 patients diagnosed with <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> in whom HRCT of the chest was performed within 24 h after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms and the diagnosis was confirmed, based on a positive culture of sputum or bronchial aspirate, together with a positive pleural fluid or blood culture, within one week after symptom <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were 20 male patients and 10 female patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median age was 21 years (range, 1-41 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The BMT had been performed for the treatment of the following: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, in 14 cases; severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, in 6; <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo>, in 4; Fanconi's <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, in 3; and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, in 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two radiologists analyzed the HRCT scans and reached their final decisions by consensus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The most common HRCT findings were air-space consolidation (in 60%), small centrilobular nodules (in 50%), ground-glass opacities (in 40%), bronchial wall thickening (in 20%), large nodules (in 20%), pleural lesions (in 16.7%) and tree-in-bud opacities (in 10%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The pulmonary lesions were distributed in the central and peripheral areas in 15 patients, whereas they were exclusively peripheral in 11 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Lesions were located in the lower and middle lobes of the lung in 22 and 20 patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The most common HRCT findings in our patient sample were air-space consolidation, small centrilobular nodules and ground-glass opacities, most often in the central and peripheral regions of the middle and lower lung zones </plain></SENT>
