<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0240066" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron deficiency</z:e>, committed erythroid progenitors lose responsiveness to erythropoietin, resulting in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001908'>hypoplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To address the basis for iron regulation of erythropoiesis, we established primary hematopoietic cultures with transferrin saturation levels that restricted erythropoiesis but permitted granulopoiesis and megakaryopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Experiments in this system identified as a critical regulatory element the aconitases, multifunctional <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30408">iron-sulfur cluster</z:chebi> proteins that metabolize <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50744">citrate</z:chebi> to isocitrate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Iron restriction suppressed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> and cytosolic aconitase activity in erythroid but not granulocytic or megakaryocytic progenitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An active site aconitase inhibitor, fluorocitrate, blocked erythroid differentiation in a manner similar to iron deprivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Exogenous isocitrate abrogated the erythroid iron restriction response in vitro and reversed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> progression in iron-deprived mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mechanism for aconitase regulation of erythropoiesis most probably involves both production of metabolic intermediates and modulation of erythropoietin signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One relevant signaling pathway appeared to involve protein kinase Calpha/beta, or possibly protein kinase Cdelta, whose activities were regulated by iron, isocitrate, and erythropoietin </plain></SENT>
