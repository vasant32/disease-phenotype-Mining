<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine gamma-interferon gene expression in the bone marrow of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most patients with acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> respond to immunosuppressive therapy, implicating an immune pathophysiologic origin for this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Clinical Center, National Institutes of Health </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: 25 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> on presentation, 18 patients after treatment, 39 patients with other hematologic syndromes, and 20 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: gamma-Interferon signal was detected in the bone marrow of 14 of 18 patients with severe <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> on presentation, 4 of 7 patients with moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, and 1 of 2 patients with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0004818'>paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</z:hpo>-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The gamma-interferon gene was not expressed in marrow from 20 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> persons or in patients who had received many transfusions for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>; with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> after chemotherapy; or with marrow failure of other types, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo>, inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemias</z:hpo>, or constitutional <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In serial studies, gamma-interferon <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> disappeared from the marrow of patients as they responded to immunosuppression; the signal was present in 3 of 4 patients who had a relapse but not in previously treated, now recovered patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Determination of marrow gamma-interferon gene expression was more specific and sensitive than concurrent determinations in peripheral blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Quantitative titration of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> showed that gamma-interferon expression was not a simple function of the number of lymphocytes in samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: gamma-Interferon expression is prevalent in acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and may be a specific marker of this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Local production of this inhibitory lymphokine in the target organ, the bone marrow, may be important in mediating <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Measurement of this lymphokine's message may be useful in distinguishing acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> from other forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
