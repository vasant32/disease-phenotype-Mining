<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Megakaryocyte colony formation from nonadherent low density T lymphocyte-depleted (NALDT-) bone marrow cells was increased significantly after the addition of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> serum (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AAS</z:e>) or purified megakaryocyte colony-stimulating factor (Meg-CSF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The addition of conditioned medium obtained from phytohemagglutinin-stimulated T lymphocytes replaced, at least partially, the requirement for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AAS</z:e> or purified Meg-CSF for the growth of megakaryocyte colonies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cellular influence of T lymphocytes and T lymphocyte subsets on megakaryocyte colony formation was assessed by removing either T cells from nonadherent peripheral blood mononuclear cells with monoclonal OKT4, OKT8, or OKT3 antibodies plus complement, or by adding back populations of bone marrow or blood T4+ or T8+ lymphocytes, isolated by means of fluorescence-activated cell sorting, respectively, to NALDT--bone marrow or -blood cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When sorted T cell subpopulations were added to a fixed number of NALDT--bone marrow or -peripheral blood cells in the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AAS</z:e> or Meg-CSF, T4+ cells enhanced megakaryocyte colony formation and T8+ cells decreased it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These studies demonstrate that although the stimulation of megakaryocytic progenitor cells by Meg-CSF may not require the presence of monocytes or T lymphocytes, T4+ lymphocytes enhance and T8+ lymphocytes down-regulate megakaryocyte colony formation induced by Meg-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest that the immune system is capable of modulating the proliferative response of human megakaryocytic progenitor cells to Meg-CSF </plain></SENT>
