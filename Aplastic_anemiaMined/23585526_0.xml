<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="49005">Deferasirox</z:chebi> reduced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> patients enrolled in the EPIC study (n=116) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A post-hoc analysis of hematologic responses was conducted on 72 patients with evaluable hematologic parameters (according to UK guideline criteria), 24 of whom received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49005">deferasirox</z:chebi> without concomitant immunosuppressive treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Partial hematologic responses were observed in 11/24 (45.8%) patients; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> became transfusion-independent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One patient had an additional platelet response and one patient had an additional platelet and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean serum ferritin levels at end of study were significantly reduced in partial hematologic responders (n=11; 3948+/-4998 ng/mL; baseline 6693+/-7014 ng/mL; % change from baseline 45.7%, P=0.0029) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In non-responders, the reduction in serum ferritin was less pronounced (n=13; 2021+/-3242 ng/mL; baseline 4365+/-3063 ng/mL; % change from baseline 27.6%, P=0.0171) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Alongside reduction in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49005">deferasirox</z:chebi> may therefore improve hematologic parameters in a subset of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further investigation is required to elucidate the mechanisms involved </plain></SENT>
