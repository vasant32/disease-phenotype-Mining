<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To investigate whether certain HLA class II genes are associated with susceptibility to such CyA-dependent AA, we determined the HLA class II alleles of 59 AA patients treated with CyA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among 26 patients successfully treated with CyA, 13 required a small dose of CyA to maintain stable hematopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of these 13 AA patients, 10 shared an HLA class II haplotype of DRB1*1501-DQA1*0102-DQB1*0602 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>None of the 13 responders who obtained a sustained remission off CyA therapy possessed this haplotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the 10 patients who shared the HLA class II haplotype, single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis of each gene fragment of this haplotype failed to detect a polymorphism in the nucleotide sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When the AA patients were assessed for their likelihood to respond to CyA therapy, the response rate in patients with this haplotype (71%) was significantly higher than that of patients with another haplotype associated with HLA-DR2, DRB1*1502-DQA1*0103-DQB1*0601 (36%) and that of patients without HLA-DR2 (35%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that the CyA-dependent response of AA is closely related to an HLA class II haplotype of DRB1*1501-DQA1*0102-DQB1*0602 and suggest that, in AA patients with this haplotype, immune mechanisms play an important role in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
