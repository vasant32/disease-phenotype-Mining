<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Biologic products of heterologous sera have been used to treat a variety of conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One example is anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG), which is approved for use in the management of renal transplantation and for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As ATG is a product of heterologous sera it has the potential for adverse reactions, including <z:mp ids='MP_0002531'>anaphylaxis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients can be skin tested prior to ATG administration to aid in determining hypersensitivity status to ATG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To provide case reports to illustrate evaluation for ATG hypersensitivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Also, to discuss desensitization procedures for patients who are found to have ATG hypersensitivity, and yet are to receive the medication as it is judged to be essential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORTS: We report four patients who were to receive ATG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results of skin testing and each patient's response to ATG are reviewed to illustrate problems that can occur in evaluating the hypersensitivity status of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further, some patients also underwent ATG desensitization, but none completed the entire protocol successfully </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Their outcomes are reviewed to illustrate problems that can occur with the desensitization procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Anti-thymocyte globulin is a product of heterologous sera and has the potential to produce <z:mp ids='MP_0002531'>anaphylaxis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It is recommended that patients be skin tested prior to administration to aid in determining hypersensitivity status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Those patients who demonstrate hypersensitivity to ATG should not receive ATG unless it is deemed essential and benefits are judged to outweigh risks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In these circumstances, patients are candidates for ATG desensitization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Complications with desensitization occurred in the cases attempted, and highlights that desensitization to ATG, a xenogeneic protein, carries risk and can be difficult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Physicians involved in such cases should be familiar with interpretation of skin tests and problems that can occur with desensitization </plain></SENT>
