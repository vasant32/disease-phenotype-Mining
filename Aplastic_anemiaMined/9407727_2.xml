<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) is the most common treatment for young patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (SAA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Late graft failure represents one of the possible unfavorable outcomes in this setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mixed chimerism might represent a risk factor for late graft failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We examined this relationship by studying chimerism in long-term survivor SAA patients after allogeneic BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed long-term hematopoietic chimerism in 15 patients who received BMTs for SAA: 9 with an irradiation-based conditioning regimen and 6 with ATG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We used a PCR method targeting VNTR loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity of the technique ranged between 0.5 and 1.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients conditioned with radiation-based schemes showed complete donor chimerism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Conversely, out of six patients who received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> and ATG as a conditioning regimen, only one of them had late graft failure (day +168) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In this patient, durable mixed chimera status was first detected two months after BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that in long-term survivors of SAA after BMT there is almost always complete donor chimerism in both irradiated and ATG-conditioned recipients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Mixed chimerism might predict graft failure in these patients </plain></SENT>
