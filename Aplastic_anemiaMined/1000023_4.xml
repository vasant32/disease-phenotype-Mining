<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> HA: the hepatic ultrastructural aspect showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> abnormalities affecting structure (paracrystalline inclusions), size (giant mitochondria) and shape (irregular mitochondria); there was a decrease of Bil-GT activity in 80 percent of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No connection could be shown between the HA etiology and the degree of the enzymatic activity decrease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The physiopathological mechanism of this enzymatic activity decrease is unknown; no deficiency of PNP-GT was observed; in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemias</z:hpo> there does not seem to be any modification, either of Bil-GT activity, or of hepatic PNP-GT activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that Bil-GT is often decreased in HA and that neither Bil-GT measurement nor the ultrastructural aspect of the liver distinguish <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> HA from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017551" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Gilbert's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
