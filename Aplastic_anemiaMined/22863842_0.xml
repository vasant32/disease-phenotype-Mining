<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>With improvements in hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) outcomes for severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (SAA), there is a growing population of SAA survivors after HCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there is a paucity of information regarding late effects that occur after HCT in SAA survivors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study describes the malignant and nonmalignant late effects in survivors with SAA after HCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A descriptive analysis was conducted of 1718 patients post-HCT for acquired SAA between 1995 and 2006 reported to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The prevalence and cumulative incidence estimates of late effects are reported for 1-year HCT survivors with SAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the HCT recipients, 1176 (68.5%) and 542 (31.5%) patients underwent a matched sibling donor (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MSD</z:e>) or unrelated donor (URD) HCT, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median age at the time of HCT was 20 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median interval from diagnosis to transplantation was 3 months for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MSD</z:e> HCT and 14 months for URD HCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up was 70 months and 67 months for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MSD</z:e> and URD HCT survivors, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overall survival at 1 year, 2 years, and 5 years for the entire cohort was 76% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 74-78), 73% (95% CI: 71-75), and 70% (95% CI: 68-72) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Among 1-year survivors of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MSD</z:e> HCT, 6% had 1 late effect and 1% had multiple late effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>For 1-year survivors of URD HCT, 13% had 1 late effect and 2% had multiple late effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Among survivors of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MSD</z:e> HCT, the cumulative incidence estimates of developing late effects were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> &lt;3% and did not increase over time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In contrast, for recipients of URD HCT, the cumulative incidence of developing several late effects exceeded 3% by 5 years: gonadal dysfunction 10.5% (95% CI: 7.3-14.3), growth disturbance 7.2% (95% CI: 4.4-10.7), <z:hpo ids='HP_0010885'>avascular necrosis</z:hpo> 6.3% (95% CI: 3.6-9.7), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000821'>hypothyroidism</z:hpo> 5.5% (95% CI: 2.8-9.0), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000518'>cataracts</z:hpo> 5.1% (95% CI: 2.9-8.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Our results indicated that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients undergoing HCT for SAA remain at risk for late effects, must be counseled about, and should be monitored for late effects for the remainder of their lives </plain></SENT>
