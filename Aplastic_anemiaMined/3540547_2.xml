<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Their ages ranged from one to 13 years (median, seven years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twelve children had constitutional <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath>; nine of 11 children had responded to <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, by actuarial analysis, only 48% would survive at five years and only 16% after 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two children had acquired <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath>; in 16 children this had no obvious cause </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By means of the criteria of the International <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>Aplastic Anemia</z:hpo> Study Group, patients were categorized into severe and non-severe groups at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Severe disease was present at diagnosis in nine of 22 children with acquired <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> but in no child with constitutional disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two patients with severe acquired <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> showed a transient response to <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> therapy, whereas five of nine children with acquired <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> which was not severe showed a sustained response to such therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A significant difference in survival times was seen between severe and non-severe groups at five years; two (17%) of nine children with severe <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> survived, compared with eight (67%) of 12 children with non-severe <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three children with severe <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> who were treated with antilymphocyte globulin showed no improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of five children who underwent bone-marrow transplantation for severe or progressive disease, four survived </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that bone-marrow transplantation, as a matter of urgency, is the treatment of choice for severe acquired aplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo>; it is also recommended for mild acquired or constitutional <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> when progressive disease is present or where transfusion therapy will be required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Antilymphocyte globulin is an alternative form of treatment for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277564" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">acquired disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">Androgen</z:chebi> therapy is effective in the treatment of non-severe acquired and constitutional aplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
