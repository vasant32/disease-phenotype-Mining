<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the effect of antithymocyte globulin (ATG) with or without <z:chebi fb="5" ids="50113">androgens</z:chebi> in 121 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fifty-three patients with moderate to severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> were prospectively randomized to receive ATG with or without oral <z:chebi fb="5" ids="50113">androgens</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eleven of 26 patients (42%) receiving ATG plus <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi> responded, including three complete and eight partial responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twelve of 27 patients (44%) receiving ATG plus placebo responded, including five complete and seven partial responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The difference in response rates was not significant (P greater than .9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Survival was also comparable in the two groups; for patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, actuarial survival at two years was 55% +/- 24% (95% confidence interval) in patients receiving ATG plus <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi> compared with 50% +/- 24% in the ATG plus placebo group (P = .65) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, results in both groups were indistinguishable from those obtained in 68 historical controls receiving ATG without <z:chebi fb="5" ids="50113">androgens</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that <z:chebi fb="5" ids="50113">androgens</z:chebi> are not required in order to respond to antithymocyte globulin and the addition of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="50113">androgens</z:chebi>, as used in this trial, did not significantly improve response rates to ATG treatment </plain></SENT>
