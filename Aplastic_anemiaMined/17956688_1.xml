<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The study was aimed to investigate the changes of T-cell subgroups in the peripheral blood (PB) of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) and the relationships between these changes and the pathogenesis of AA and the immunosuppressive therapeutic effects in AA, in order to provide a basis for selecting rational therapy of AA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>T-cell subtype and the ratio of CD4+/CD8+ cell in the PB of 88 AA patients which had been diagnosed clearly and given conventional therapy or conventional therapy combined with immunotherapy were analyzed by tri-colour fluorescence-labeled monoclonal antibody and using multiparameter flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients with AA were divided into <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> type of ratio, inverted type of ratio, hypernormal type of ratio according to the ratio of CD4+/CD8+ cell in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> group, and then the relations of these subtype with patients' conditions and therapeutic effects were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the percentage of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> type of ratio in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients was 39.8%, the percentage of inverted type of ratio in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients was 44.3%, The percentage of hypernormal type of ratio in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients was 15.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the conventional therapy alone, there was no significant difference on therapeutic effects among these three immunological subtypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In combined immunotherapy, total therapeutic efficacy of AA patients with inverted type of ratio and AA patients with immunologic abnormality (inverted type + hypernormal type) was 84.2% and 82.6% respectively, which were more than that in conventional therapy (45.5% and 42.8%) (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Total therapeutic efficacy in these patients was better than that in AA patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that significant abnormal ratios of CD4+/CD8+ exist in the majority of AA patients, abnormal ratios of CD4+/CD8+ both may be showed as increase or decrease, immunologic abnormality may play a role in pathogenesis of the patients with AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The detection of PB T-cell subtype in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> contributes to evaluation of patients' condition and choice of rational treatment prescription, and enhancement of diagnostic level and therapeutic efficacy significantly, which is an important indicator for therapeutic strategy also </plain></SENT>
