<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Transplants were performed between 1980 and 1987 and reported to the International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three conditioning regimens (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> alone, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> plus limited field radiation, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> plus total body radiation) were studied; none was associated with superior long-term survival </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Higher survival with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> resulted from decreased risks of interstitial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> (P less than .0002) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD (P less than .005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additional risk factors adversely associated with survival included <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> pretransplant (P less than .004), use of parous or transfused female donors (P less than .005), older patient age (P less than .005), and 20 or more pretransplant transfusions (P less than .006) </plain></SENT>
