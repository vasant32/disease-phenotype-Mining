<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A modification of the standard measure of plasma iron turnover has been developed in which erythron transferrin uptake (ETU) rather than iron uptake has been calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The ETU has the advantage of providing a parameter of erythroid marrow activity independent of change produced by plasma iron and transferrin saturation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Measurements in 80 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> were compared to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> value of 60 +/- 12 mumol/L whole blood/d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean ETU for ten patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and for six patients with pure red-cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> were 12 +/- 8 and 12 +/- 11 mumol/L whole blood/d, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In ten transfusion-dependent patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo> under dialysis therapy, the mean value was 35 +/- 11, while ten other dialyzed patients who were transfusion independent had a mean ETU of 73 +/- 21 mumol/L whole blood/d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sixteen patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001878'>hemolytic anemia</z:hpo> had an average ETU of 400 +/- 130, while 28 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0010972'>ineffective erythropoiesis</z:hpo> had a mean value of 474 +/- 147 mumol/L whole blood/d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>While patients with hypoproliferative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> showed no relation between the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> and ETU, those with hyperproliferative erythroid marrow showed increasing values as the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> became more severe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sequential measurements in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> under treatment and in thalassemic patients under transfusion therapy showed the value of this measurement in monitoring the effects of treatment on erythroid marrow activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the measurement of ETU provides a more direct ferrokinetic evaluation of erythroid activity in anemic states </plain></SENT>
