<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although additional immunosuppression with irradiation may decrease graft failure, significant sequelae may ensue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated a nonirradiation containing conditioning regimen for children with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> with matched sibling donors utilizing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> and anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To accelerate myeloid recovery, GM-CSF was used posttransplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twelve patients, with a median age of 3 years underwent BMT from HLA identical sibling (n = 11) or syngeneic (n = 1) donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Conditioning was <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> 50 mg/kg x 4 days and anti-thymocyte globulin 30 mg/kg x 3 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>GM-CSF was administered at 10 micrograms/kg until a neutrophil count of 1,000 was achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">Cyclosporine</z:chebi> alone was used for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> prophylaxis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients achieved durable engraftment at follow-up of 5-51 + months, with the exception of the identical twin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Median time to neutrophil counts &gt; 200/microliters, 500/microliters, and 1,000/microliters were 12, 13, and 15 days, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> GVHD of less than or equal to grade II occurred in four patients; one patient had grade III </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This has resolved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The nonradiation conditioning regimen of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>/ATG appears to achieve durable engraftment in transfused children with matched sibling donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>GM-CSF may accelerate myeloid recovery without exacerbating GVHD, but its contribution to allogeneic transplant required further study </plain></SENT>
