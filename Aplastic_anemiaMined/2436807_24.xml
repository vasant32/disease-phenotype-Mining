<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment of peptone-elicited macrophages 1 day with 300-1200 U/ml CSF-1 induced moderate killing and greatly stimulated lymphokine (LK)-induced killing of [3H]<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi>-labeled TU5 <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo> cells to levels above that seen with fresh macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Further addition of CSF-1 at Day 1 at the time of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> lysis assay promoted moderate increases in spontaneous and LK-induced activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CSF-1 did not stimulate freshly harvested exudate macrophages to lyse TU5 targets in the presence or absence of lymphokine (LK) activators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">Lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi> (LPS) at 0.1-1000 ng/ml did not stimulate cytotoxicity, and the low endotoxin content and the use of polymyxin B and C3H/HeJ mice excluded a role for LPS in these experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Incubation of the macrophages with IFN and the myeloid growth factors IL-3 and GM-CSF did not stimulate tumoricidal activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CSF-1 has been proposed as a therapeutic agent to restore myeloid cell numbers in induced (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> chemotherapy, bone marrow transplantation, etc.) and natural <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These studies show that CSF-1 also may be useful in combination with LK activators to promote resistance to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in mature mononuclear cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CSF-1 may have similar effects in LK-activated macrophages to enhance resistance to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
