<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Elevated deformability was observed in neonatal erythrocytes, and during recovery from <z:hpo ids='HP_0005510'>transient erythroblastopenia</z:hpo> of childhood, when fetal-like red cells are known to be produced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Increased deformability appears to be a feature of fetal and fetal-like red cells </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty out of 32 G-6-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>(A-) individuals, including both heterozygotes and hemizygotes, exhibited increased deformability during the steady state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, G-6-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>(Med) hemizygotes had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> deformability </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Because increased red cell deformability is a feature of fetal erythrocytes, these results suggest that the red cells in many cases of glycolytic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149676" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">enzyme deficiency</z:e> are fetal-like </plain></SENT>
