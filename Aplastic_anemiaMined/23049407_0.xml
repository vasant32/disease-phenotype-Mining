<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> patients may initially present with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> and a <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>hypoplastic bone marrow</z:hpo> leading to the initial diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In most of these patients clinical improvement occurs, with normalization of the complete blood count within six months, although recovery can also develop a few weeks after initiating steroid therapy </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No specific therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> was administered, nevertheless a full spontaneous recovery was observed in both cases </plain></SENT>
