<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The amount of this <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> ranges from traces to 40% of the total Hb F </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The same gamma75 Thr chain is also present in the Hb F of 40% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> newborns and premature infants examined, of one 14-week-old fetus and in one out of 3 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and raised levels of Hb F </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our results strongly suggest that the synthesis of this new chain is under the control of a gamma gene nonallelic with those coding for Agamma and Ggamma chains </plain></SENT>
