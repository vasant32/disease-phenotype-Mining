<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The first group of eight patients received rhG-CSF in doses of 100 to 400 micrograms/m2/d by a daily 30-minute intravenous infusion for one or two weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Doses up to 400 micrograms/m2/d were well tolerated and resulted in increases of neutrophil counts in 5 out of 8 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We gave rhG-CSF (400 micrograms/m2/d) to the second group of 26 patients by a daily 30-minute intravenous infusion for two weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The treatment resulted in an increase of neutrophil counts in 15 out of 26 patients (3.1 to 29.5 fold) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further, higher doses (800 or 1,200 micrograms/m2/d) were administered in 5 patients who did not respond to the dose of 400 micrograms/m2/d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The treatment increased the neutrophil counts in 3 out of 5 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The third group of five patients received rhG-CSF subcutaneously in doses of 20 to 400 micrograms/m2/d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An increase of neutrophil counts was noted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> five patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Differential counts of bone marrow aspirate revealed an increase of myeloid: erythroid ratios </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, the responses were transient and neutrophil counts returned to basal levels within 1 approximately 2 weeks after discontinuing treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No severe toxicity due to rhG-CSF was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that rhG-CSF is effective on stimulating granulopoiesis in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This treatment will be particularly useful for the patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> suffering from <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026946" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fungal infections</z:e> </plain></SENT>
