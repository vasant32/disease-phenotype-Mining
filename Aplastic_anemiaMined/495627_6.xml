<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This group was homogeneous with regard to the clinical and laboratory survey, and the treatment used [high-dose <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi> therapy] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The "hierarchy" of the individual prognostic parameters has been established: current severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, granulocyte count, percentage of the nonmyeloid cells on the bone marrow slides, platelet count, reticulocyte count, 59Fe utilization, and stromal disorganization on the bone marrow biopsy specimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As these parameters are interrelated, a multiparametric analysis enables us to define groups of patients with different short-term evolution and to derive a prognostic index from these data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The use of such an index, however, allows a correct prediction in only 73 per cent of the cases, better in the milder than in the more severe cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is possible that the short-term evolutive tendency (improvement or worsening during the first six weeks of therapy) may contribute supplementary information useful for prognosis and the choice of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After the first three months critical period, the mortality rate no longer depends on the initial severity of the disease but exclusively on the clinical and hematologic improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, comparing the hematologic data obtained initially and after three months of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi> therapy allows us to correctly predict the long-term evolution </plain></SENT>
