<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical and histochemical stainings were used to clarify the relationship between blood transfusion and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_41'>iron deposition</z:mpath> in the islet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Disease of the lymphohemopoietic system (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>) or liver (<z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo>) accounted for 86.1% of the patients' main diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sixteen of them had slight hemosiderin deposition (Group 1), twenty cases had severe hemosiderin deposition (Group 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Another ten cases were used as controls (Group 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cases had a similar age distribution to Group 1 and 2, with neither blood transfusion nor hemosiderin deposition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The volume of blood transfusion was 6.1 +/- 3.6, 17.5 +/- 12.2 L for Groups 1 and 2, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> was 137.8 +/- 54.4 and 170.6 +/- 108.4 mg/dL, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Four cases in Group 1 and 14 cases in Group 2 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0003076'>glycosuria</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The number of islet cells with hemosiderin increased with the enlargement of transfusion volume (r = 0.664, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Plasma <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> also related with the percentage of hemosiderin positive islet cell (r = 0.386, P &lt; 0.025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In severely iron-overloaded cases, hemosiderin was selectively deposited in B cells of the islet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It was concluded that large amounts of blood transfusions for non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242354" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">congenital disease</z:e> can induce selective hemosiderin deposition and impairment of pancreatic B cell that may result in <z:hpo ids='HP_0003074'>hyperglycemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> of the patients </plain></SENT>
