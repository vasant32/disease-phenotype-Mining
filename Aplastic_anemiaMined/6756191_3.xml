<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> were gathered from similar institutions and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> were similarly followed and treated with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="50113">androgens</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The following conclusions were drawn: 1) Initial severity is greater in children than in adults, and is greater in acquired than in genetic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>; 2) even in cases of similar initial severity, the early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate is higher in children than in adults; 3) a multiparametric index allows the correct prediction of short-term evolution in 70% of the cases and thus <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">aids</z:e> in providing an indication for bone marrow graft; its sensitivity is similar to that of the classical parameters proposed by Camitta, et al., but its specificity significantly higher; 4) most <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occurred during the first 3-4 months and the chance for long-term improvement appears similar in the more severe than in the less severe cases if they survive this delay; 5) some data (relapse after <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi> withdrawal and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi>-dependence and failure of corticoid therapy alone) suggest that <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi> therapy in children is useful, as it is in adults, and that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> do not modify the course of the disease at its usual dosage (1 mg/kg/day); and 6) very few side effects, particularly concerning height, of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="50113">androgens</z:chebi> were noted in the survivors at adult age after long-term <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi> therapy prescribed before puberty </plain></SENT>
