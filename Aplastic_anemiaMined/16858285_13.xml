<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An increased rejection of male grafts in female recipients is not reported for solid organ or stem cell transplants and the role of H-Y as transplantation antigen has been controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data from 1481 patients with a hematopoietic stem cell transplant for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> reported from 154 centers in 28 countries were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Outcome was compared between patients with donors of the same or opposite sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Survival at 5 years was significantly better in patients with donors from the same sex: 68% vs. 60% (P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Male patients with female donors had a decreased survival (relative risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> 1.52, P &lt; 0.001) and an increased risk of severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (relative risk 1.33, P = 0.03) compared to recipients of sex-matched grafts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Female patients with male donors had a decreased survival (relative risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> 1.44, P = 0.01) and an increased risk of rejection (relative risk 2.20, P = 0.01) compared to recipients of sex-matched grafts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In a subgroup analysis, the negative effects of donor/recipient sex-mismatching appeared confined to patients receiving conditioning regimens not containing antithymocyte globulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data confirm H-Y as a clinically relevant transplantation antigen, in both the graft-versus-host and the host-versus-graft direction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Wherever possible, donor-recipient sex-matching should be integrated into donor selection algorithms </plain></SENT>
