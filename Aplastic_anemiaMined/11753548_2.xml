<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) from a compatible donor provides long-term survival in 60 to 80% of sAA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, graft rejection still remains a major problem, and a second allograft is an alternative for these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively analyzed 34 patients who received a second BMT (BMT2), nine with primary graft failure (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="26340">PGF</z:chebi>) and 25 with transient engraftment (TE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The probability of survival at 13 years among <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26340">PGF</z:chebi> patients was 22% vs 60% for the TE group (P = 0.0068) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Age (&lt;17 vs&gt;17 years), number of mononuclear cells (&lt;3 vs &gt;3 x 10(8)/kg) and year of transplant (1986-1991 vs 1992-1998) at BMT2 had no statistical influence on survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A significant survival advantage was noted among TE patients (P = 0.0068), which was probably because of a longer intertransplant interval (&gt;90 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, 90% of patients with positive blood cultures at BMT2 did not survive the procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that early detection of primary graft failure (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="26340">PGF</z:chebi>), followed by measures attempting to promote hematopoietic recovery (eg use of growth factors, further infusion of stem cells) may decrease mortality </plain></SENT>
