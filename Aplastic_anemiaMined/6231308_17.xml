<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> plasmas were found to contain glycocalicin, even in samples treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37670">protease inhibitors</z:chebi> and centrifuged extensively to remove platelets and platelet fragments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Confirmation that the plasma antigen had a relative molecular weight similar or identical to glycocalicin was obtained from studies employing gel chromatography and affinity chromatography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An immunoradiometric assay was developed to quantify plasma glycocalicin, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> plasma was found to contain approximately 1-3 micrograms/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The plasma of a patient with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> had less than 12.5% of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> level of glycocalicin, whereas two patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> due to diseases of increased platelet destruction (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001973'>idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005575'>hemolytic-uremic syndrome</z:hpo>) had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, there appears to be ongoing catabolism of platelet GPIb in vivo, and we postulate that the plasma level of glycocalicin reflects a complex function of factors, including platelet count, platelet turnover, and the site of platelet destruction </plain></SENT>
