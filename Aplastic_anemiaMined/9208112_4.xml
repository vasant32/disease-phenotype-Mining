<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The median time from diagnosis to marrow transplantation (BMT) was 15 months (range 1-96 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>More than half of the patients had received more than 10 units of red blood cells or platelet transfusions prior to BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pretransplant immunosuppression consisted of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (CY) alone (n = 10), CY in combination with total body irradiation (n = 8), and CY and antithymocyte globulin (n = 2) </plain></SENT>
