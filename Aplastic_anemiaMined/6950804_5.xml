<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Chromosomes of bone marrow from 28 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> nonlymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (ANLL) (26 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, 2 with AMMoL), 19 of whom had chromosome abnormalities, were studied; 11 cases exhibited previously unreported karyotypic abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The marrows of two cases had 8-21 translocations associated with an iso-X chromosome in the female patient and with 9q13- and a missing Y in the male patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Usually, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients with a 8-21 translocation have been considered to have a good prognosis; however, our cases had rather short survival times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the prognosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> with an 8-21 translocation but associated with other abnormalities is still not clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Centromere spreading (CS), which was originally reported in marrow cells of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001889'>megaloblastic anemia</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="13" ids="33611">B12</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27470">folic acid</z:chebi> deficiency), was detected in leukemic cells, disappeared during remission, and reappeared on relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that CS may be a new type of abnormality in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In two patients with atypical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001908'>hypoplastic anemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001878'>hemolytic anemia</z:hpo>, chromosome abnormalities were detected at the anemic stage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One case with CS was associated with atypical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001908'>hypoplastic anemia</z:hpo> and developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> after 1 year; the other with 48,XY,+i(1q),+3,/12 and -14 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001878'>hemolytic anemia</z:hpo> and developed AMMoL 3 weeks later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, identical clones were detected both before and after the clinical diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These cases strongly support the concept that some chromosome abnormalities precede the clinical manifestations of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The present study also revealed that lymphocytes in ANLL respond poorly to PHA in the presence of high numbers of blasts but do respond well to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogens</z:chebi> during remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the response of lymphocytes to PHA may serve as one criterion for determining remission </plain></SENT>
