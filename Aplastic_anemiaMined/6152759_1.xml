<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These antibodies were detected not only in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with ATL but frequently in those diagnosed as T-cell malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> or T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo>; the positivity rate of anti-ATLA antibody was lower in B- and null-cell-type <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>About 5.5% of the healthy individuals over 40 years of age in the endemic area (Kumamoto) were carriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The rate of positivity gradually increased with age, and was higher in females than in males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, the peripheral blood mono-nuclear cells and/or lymph node cells from patients with various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0947743,C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematological disorders</z:e>, including ATL, were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The presence of human T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> virus type I (HTLV-I) proviral DNA was confirmed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with ATL and in some with T-cell-type malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In endemic areas, detection of proviral DNA is essential for the classification and diagnosis of T-cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
