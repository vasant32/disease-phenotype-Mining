<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Growth studies in vitro revealed that both the N-BMF and AA-BMF had a logarithmic growth phase of eight days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Population doubling time for six of the 12 N-BMF and seven of the 12 AA-BMF was greater than 50 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five of the 12 AA-BMF studied in contrast to only two of the 12 N-BMF had a population doubling time of less than 50 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The remaining four N-BMF had a population doubling time of greater than 100 h </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During a similar duration in the logarithmic phase of growth, the AA-BMF underwent an average of 2.499 population doublings in comparison to 1.586 doublings by N-BMF (P = less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The AA-BMF grew in multiple layers compared with the N-BMF, which usually grew as a monolayer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At the end of the logarithmic phase of growth, the AA-BMF also had a significantly higher number of cells per dish than the N-BMF (P = 0.02 on analysis of variance and covariance) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that a subgroup of AA-BMF grows faster than N-BMF and that the AA-BMF lack cell-to-cell inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">Testosterone</z:chebi>, 3 alpha-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="28195">etiocholanolone</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> at 1 X 10(-8)M concentration, a physiological concentration, stimulated the growth of N-BMF as evidenced by increase in cell numbers and radioactive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> (3H-TdR) uptake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>While <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> had a stimulating effect on growth of N-BMF, it suppressed the growth of AA-BMF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Specific binding of radioactive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> (3H-dexa) was determined both for the N-BMF and AA-BMF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Specific binding sites for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> (Bmax) present on the N-BMF ranged from 460 to 770 fmol/mg protein) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Bmax for AA-BMF was low (27-215 fmol/mg protein) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In addition, the dissociation constant (Kd) was ten times lower for AA-BMF (1.0 X 10(-7) M) than for N-BMF (1.1 X 10(-8) M) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The observations on the growth studies, the paradoxical response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi>, and the difference in the number of binding sites for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> indicate that the marrow fibroblasts from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> are abnormal </plain></SENT>
