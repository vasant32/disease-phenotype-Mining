<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The initial use of immunosuppressive therapy (IST) in severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (sAA) or reapplication of IST-centered methods following disease relapse is successful only in well-selected patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The potential treatment by autologous stem cell (SC) transplant in sAA is still an innovative/pioneering therapeutic approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To our best knowledge, this is the second published case of autologous SC transplant in sAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this work was to optimize mobilization and timing for SC harvesting - using our own controlled-rate cryopreservation - with higher CD34(+)/CD90(+) subset yield and recovery in order to obtain complete and long-term hematopoietic reconstitution following autologous SC transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We report a 35 year-old sAA male patient who initially underwent IST using rabbit ATG and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">Cyclosporine</z:chebi> A (CsA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>He was supportive transfusion dependent for the whole period of IST-phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After the second IST-cycle, polymorphonuclear (PMN) cell count increase (&gt;2.0 × 10(9)/L) was observed, when SC mobilization, two large volume leukapheresis procedures and following autologous transplant were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The yields of harvested CD34(+) and CD34(+)/CD90(+) cells were 5.75 × 10(6)/kgbm and 1.7 × 10(6)/kgbm, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The quantity of applied CD34(+) and CD34(+)/CD90(+) cells in autologous SC transplant were 5.45 × 10(6)/kgbm (7-AAD(CD34)(+)(viability)=95.42%) and 1.63 × 10(6)/kgbm (7-AAD(CD34)(+)(/CD90)(+)(viability)=95.42%), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Hematopoietic reconstitution registered due to second month after autologous SC transplant and he is 24 months in complete medullar, hematological and clinical remission, with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cytogenetic status - applying only continuous CsA therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results obtained strongly confirm that in sAA, with no allogeneic SC donor, autologous transplant can result in a successful clinical outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We suggest that CD34(+)/CD90(+) subset count in peripheral blood and/or cell-harvest could be more valuable predictive factor than total CD34(+) quantity of optimized collection-timing and superior treatment efficacy of autologous SC transplant in sAA </plain></SENT>
