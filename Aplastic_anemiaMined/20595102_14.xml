<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Clones of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24410">glycosylphosphatidylinositol</z:chebi>-anchor protein-deficient cells are characteristic in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004818'>paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</z:hpo> and are present in about 40-50% of patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometry has allowed for sensitive and precise measurement of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24410">glycosylphosphatidylinositol</z:chebi>-anchor protein-deficient red blood cells and neutrophils in severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004818'>paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</z:hpo> clones measured by flow cytometry in 207 consecutive severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> patients who received immunosuppressive therapy with a horse anti-thymocyte globulin plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> regimen from 2000 to 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The presence of a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24410">glycosylphosphatidylinositol</z:chebi>-anchor protein-deficient clone was detected in 83 (40%) patients pre-treatment, and the median clone size was 9.7% (interquartile range 3.5-29) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In patients without a detectable clone pre-treatment, the appearance of a clone after immunosuppressive therapy was infrequent, and in most with a clone pre-treatment, clone size often decreased after immunosuppressive therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, in 30 patients, an increase in clone size was observed after immunosuppressive therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The majority of patients with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0004818'>paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</z:hpo> clone detected after immunosuppressive therapy did not have an elevated <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase, nor did they experience <z:mp ids='MP_0010163'>hemolysis</z:mp> or <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp>, and they did not require specific interventions with anticoagulation and/or eculizumab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the 7 patients who did require therapy for clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0004818'>paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</z:hpo> symptoms and signs, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had an elevated <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase and a clone size greater than 50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 18 (8.6%) patients had a clone greater than 50% at any given time of sampling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The presence of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0004818'>paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</z:hpo> clone in severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> is associated with low morbidity and mortality, and specific measures to address clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0004818'>paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</z:hpo> are seldom required </plain></SENT>
