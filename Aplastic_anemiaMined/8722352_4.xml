<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Nine patients transplanted for non-malignant conditions (eight <z:hpo ids='HP_0004430'>severe combined immunodeficiency</z:hpo>, one <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>) received lectin-treated T cell-depleted BMTs from haploidentical donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Each patient subsequently received a second T cell-depleted transplant (Â¿boost') from the same donor, without conditioning, because of a delay in the recovery of T cell immunity associated with evidence of engraftment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The median time to boost after initial BMT was 0.5 years (range 0.2-4.6 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No conditioning therapy was used prior to the boost (except one patient who received ATG) and no GVHD prophylaxis was used during either the initial or subsequent BMTs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eight of the nine patients are surviving at a median follow-up of 2.9 years (range 0.3-6.2 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Following BMT boost, T cell function improved with the lymphocyte proliferative responses to PHA, PWM and alloantigen <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> increasing at least eight-fold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean percentage of CD3+ lymphocytes increased from 20 +/- 7% of total lymphocytes following the first BMT to 66 +/- 7% following the marrow boost (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This increase was generated primarily by an increase in the CD4+ lymphocyte subset which increased from 13 +/- 3% post-transplant to 44 +/- 6% after the BMT boost (P &lt; 0.005), and was reflected in both the CD4+/Leu8+ and CD4+/Leu8- lymphocyte populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Measurements of B cell immunity (immunoglobulins, isohemagglutinins and B cells) showed no significant effect of the marrow boosts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that bone marrow 'boosts' are an effective means for improving T cell immunity in patients who fail to recover adequate immune function after T cell-depleted bone marrow transplantation and may be applicable as immunotherapy following allogeneic BMT undertaken to treat <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
