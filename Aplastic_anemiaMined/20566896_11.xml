<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After 1 year, median serum ferritin decreased significantly from 3254 ng/mL at baseline to 1854 ng/mL (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Decreases occurred in chelation-naive (3229-1520 ng/mL; P &lt; .001, last-observation-carried-forward analysis), and previously chelated (3263-2585 ng/mL; P = .21, last-observation-carried-forward analysis) patients and were reflective of dose adjustments and ongoing iron intake </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Baseline labile plasma iron levels were within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range despite high serum ferritin levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The most common drug-related adverse events were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo> (22%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> (16%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> increases more than 33% above baseline and the upper limit of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> occurred in 29 patients (25%), but there were no progressive increases; concomitant use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> had a significant impact on serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The decrease in mean alanine aminotransferase levels at 1 year correlated significantly with reduction in serum ferritin (r = 0.40, P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean absolute neutrophil and platelet counts remained stable during treatment, and there were no drug-related cytopenias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This prospective dataset confirms the efficacy and well characterizes the tolerability profile of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49005">deferasirox</z:chebi> in a large population of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT00171821 </plain></SENT>
