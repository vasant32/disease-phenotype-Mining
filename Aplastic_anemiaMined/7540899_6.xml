<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study describes the neuropsychological development of 10 children treated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (n = 7), <z:hpo ids='HP_0003006'>neuroblastoma</z:hpo> (n = 1) or severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (SAA; n = 2) at 3 years of age or younger </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A moderate general <z:hpo ids='HP_0001263'>developmental delay</z:hpo>, with pronounced motor deficits and varying degrees of perceptual and cognitive problems, was observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> children treated for malignant disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Children treated for SAA had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We conclude that BMT, including TBI, can be directly associated with long-term neuropsychological impairment in children treated at a very young age </plain></SENT>
