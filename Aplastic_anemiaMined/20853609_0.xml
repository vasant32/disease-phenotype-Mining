<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To evaluate the efficiency of related and unrelated allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (alloBMT) versus immunosuppressive therapy (IST) in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) having no HLA-compatible bone marrow donor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The study covered 61 patients (34 men and 27 women) diagnosed as having acquired AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of them, 51 patients were diagnosed as having severe AA, 5 had supersevere AA, and 5 had non-severe AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Combined IST (antithymocyte globulin (ATG) + <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> (CsA)) was used in 43 patients; allo-BMT was performed in 18 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The basic types of ATG (ATGAM (Pfizer), thymoglobulin (Genzim), ATG (Fresenius), and goat antilymphocyte globulin (ALG) (Research Institute of Gerontology, Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation) were administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CsA was given in a dose of 5 mg/kg/day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The standard conditioning regimen (ATGAM + cyclophosphanum) and fludarabine-containing (fludarabine + cyclophosphanum + ATG; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi> + fludarabine + ATG) programs were used in the allo-BMT group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A combination of CsA and metothrexate was given to prevent a graft-versus-host reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the IST-receiving patients, overall survival (OS) was 71% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After the first course of IST by follow-up month 6, the response rate was 74% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The second course of IST was performed in 7 patients unresponsive after the first-line IST and in 8 patients with recurrent AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>After the second course of IST, the response rate was 46.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Four patients who failed to achieve remission after 2 courses of IST received its third course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A complete response was obtained in 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In 18 patients following allo-BMT (related and unrelated), OS was 86%; event-free survival was 65 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In 12 patients after related allo-BMT, OS was 91.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Related allo-BMT is the method of choice if there is a HLA-compatible sibling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>If there are contraindications to it or no related donor, IST with ATG + CsA is indicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Ineffective IST is an indication for unrelated allo-BMT that may be recommended as life-saving therapy for young patients under 40 years of age </plain></SENT>
