<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Identification of a rapid and noninvasive test for the follow-up of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) patients during immunosuppressive therapy (IST) to evaluate its functional effect on hematopoietic progenitors (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HPC</z:e>) and for early detection of progression to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> or relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Absolute count and apoptotic rate (AR) of peripheral blood (PB) CD34+ cells were evaluated by three-color flow cytometry for CD45, CD34, and annexin V in cord blood (CB), <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> children, and adults, as well as in pediatric patients with AA at diagnosis and during IST, Fanconi <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (FA), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> immune cytopenia, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects, the AR of PB CD34+ cells showed a progressive increase (p &lt; 0.05), while their counts decreased (p &lt; 0.05) from birth to adulthood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In very severe AA (vSAA) and severe AA (SAA) at diagnosis, the AR was 91.6% +/- 2.8%, higher than controls (p &lt; 0.05), and PB CD34+ cell count was 2.6 +/- 2.4/microL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In FA patients, the PB CD34+ AR was again significantly increased (54.2% +/- 13.7%) with an absolute count of 3.7 +/- 1.2/microL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Conversely, in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> the AR was 11.7% +/- 3.5% and the absolute count 85.1 +/- 48.2/microL (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> immune cytopenias did not significantly differ from controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Flow cytometry evaluation of PB CD34+ AR and counts is a noninvasive and feasible first-step method for the differentiation of AA and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), and it might be useful for monitoring AA during IST to secure the early detection of relapse or transformation to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
