<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Numerous case history reports have incriminated drugs in the etiology of this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because those reports were questionable, a case-control study was conducted in France between 1985 and 1988 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cases selected from the national register were eligible for inclusion when at least two blood lineages were depressed (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> &lt; or = 10 g/100 mL and reticulocytes &lt; or = 50 x 10(9)/L, granulocytes &lt; or = 1.5 x 10(9)/L, platelets &lt; or = 100 x 10(9)/L) and when the bone marrow biopsy was compatible with the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using a standardized questionnaire, trained investigators interviewed one AA patient and two groups of controls (two hospitalized patients and one neighbor of the AA patient) matched for age, sex, and interviewer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One hundred forty-seven AA patients, 287 hospitalized controls, and 108 neighbors were interviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of AA was analyzed by matched design with relation to medical history and drug use during the last 5 years, and specifically during the last year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three times as many AA patients reported having suffered from clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> during the last 6 months than either type of control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Similarly, a higher proportion of AA patients reported a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021053" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">immune disorder</z:e>, mainly <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> (odds ratio of 6.8), and a previous use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33972">gold salts</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7959">D-penicillamine</z:chebi> in the 5 previous years (odds ratio of 4.9 for each drug) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>An excess of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> and allo/thiopurinol intake in the 5 previous years was observed among the AA patients (odds ratio equal to 4.1 and 3.6, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33972">gold salts</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7959">D-penicillamine</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> were confirmed when looking for drug use within the last year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A moderate risk was associated with acetaminophen or <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30762">salicylate</z:chebi> intake during the 5 previous years or during the last year (odds ratio between 1.8 and 2.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The frequent use of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30762">salicylates</z:chebi> within the last year was associated with a high risk of AA (odds ratio of 5.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A high risk was also associated with indolic derivative intake but only when comparing AA patients to neighbor controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>No association could be evidenced with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="47381">diclofenac</z:chebi> intake, whatever the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Differences observed with recently published studies suggest that targeted studies on each category of drugs according to the treated pathologies should be initiated </plain></SENT>
