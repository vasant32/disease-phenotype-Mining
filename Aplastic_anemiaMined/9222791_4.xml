<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Aplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> is a severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">blood dyscrasia</z:e> that is more common in Thailand than in Western countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its a etiology remains poorly understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A case-control study was conducted in Bangkok and two rural regions of Thailand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effect of household pesticides was evaluated among 253 incident cases of aplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> and 1174 hospital controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 54% of the cases and 61% of the controls were exposed 1-6 months previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For most individual household pesticides and for groups classified according to chemical type (organophosphates, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39098">pyrethrins</z:chebi>, and organochlorines), the relative risk (RR) estimates approximated 1.0; upper 95% confidence limits were below 2.0 for many comparisons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A significant association was observed for exposure to combination products containing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34690">dichlorvos</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34938">propoxur</z:chebi>, with an overall RR estimate of 1.7 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.1-2.6); the estimate for regular use was 1.6 (95% CI: 0.9-2.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The absence of a higher risk for the regular use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34690">dichlorvos</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="34938">propoxur</z:chebi> reduces the credibility of the apparent association, which could well have been an artefact of multiple comparisons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that most household pesticides used in Thailand do not appear to increase the risk of aplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
