<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the potential for using a potato virus X (PVX) <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> vector system for efficient expression of the biologically functional GM-CSF protein in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The GM-CSF gene was cloned into PVX <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> expression vector, driven with the CaMV <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37983">35S</z:chebi> promoter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Gene transfer was accomplished by inoculating N. benthamiana leaves with the plasmid DNA of PVX vector containing the GM-CSF gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expression level of the recombinant GM-CSF protein was determined with ELISA and its size was confirmed by Western blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results showed that: (1) leaf age significantly affects GM-CSF protein concentration with younger leaves accumulating 19.8 mg g(-1) soluble protein which is 2.6 times the concentration in older leaves, (2) recombinant protein accumulation within a given leaf declined slightly over time but was not significantly different between 7 and 11 days post-inoculation (dpi), and (3) the two leaves immediately above the inoculated leaves play an important role for GM-CSF accumulation in the younger leaves </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Protein extracts of infected N. benthamiana leaves contained recombinant human GM-CSF protein in concentrations of up to 2% of total soluble protein, but only when the pair of leaves immediately above the inoculated leaves remained intact </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The recombinant protein actively stimulated the growth of human TF-1 cells suggesting that the recombinant human GM-CSF expressed via PVX <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> vector was biologically active </plain></SENT>
