<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The expression of TNF-α and IFN-γ in cytoplasm of peripheral CD3(+) lymphocytes were measured by flow cytometry in 25 cases of de novo AA patients and 20 cases of AA after immunosuppressive therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the positive rates of CD3(+)/TNF-α(+) and CD3(+)/IFN-γ(+) in de novo AA patients were (5.97 ± 6.78)% and (15.20 ± 11.28)% respectively, and (1.56 ± 0.87)% and (1.76 ± 0.87)% in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was significant difference between de novo AA patients and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The positive rates of CD3(+)/TNF-α(+) and CD3(+)/IFN-γ(+) in immunosuppressive therapy group were (1.67 ± 1.26)% and (4.35 ± 4.33)% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The difference between immunosuppressive therapy group and de novo AA group was statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the levels of intracellular TNF-α and IFN-γ in AA patients are higher than those in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunosuppressive therapy significantly reduces the expression of intracellular TNF-α and IFN-γ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Its relationship with the clinical treatment is worth further observing </plain></SENT>
