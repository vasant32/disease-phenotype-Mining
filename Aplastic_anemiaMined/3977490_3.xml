<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During their therapy, transfusion initially obscured these macrocytic RBCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the eight who had erythropoietic recovery, endogenous RBCs again were macrocytic, and platelets remained small whether or not the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0836924" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">platelet count increased</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The percentage of cells containing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> F changed in only one of the eight subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the eight who did not have erythropoietic recovery had no reappearance of macrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of 19 other previously treated patients whose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> level had recovered to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> for seven to 196 months, 16 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0005518'>increased mean corpuscular volume</z:hpo> (101 to 133 femtoliters) and abnormally <z:hpo ids='HP_0005537'>small platelets</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> the appearance of macrocytes reliably and easily predicts RBC recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, even in treated, apparently recovered subjects, an abnormality of blood cell size remains </plain></SENT>
