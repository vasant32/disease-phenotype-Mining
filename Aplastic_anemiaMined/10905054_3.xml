<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the frequency of some HLA loci of 102 Northern Han Chinese patients with AA and 105 healthy control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Polymerase chain reaction and sequence specific oligonucleotide probe hybridization were used to determine HLA-DR- and HLA-DR2-related DRB1 alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The frequency of DR2 is increased in AA patients; the relative risk (RR) was 2.86, and the difference was significant (chi 2 = 11.1, P = .004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The RR of HLA-DRB1*1501 was 3.07, and the difference was significant (chi 2 = 9.42, P = .008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The above results suggest that HLA-DR2 is significantly associated with AA in Northern Han Chinese </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>HLA-DRB1*1501 is the main subtype of HLA-DR2, and may be the susceptibility gene of AA </plain></SENT>
