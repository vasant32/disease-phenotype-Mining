<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using three different <z:hpo ids='HP_0001417'>X-linked</z:hpo> gene probes, we failed to detect clonal hematopoiesis in seven CyA-responsive female patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clonal hematopoiesis was detected in two of six female patients refractory to CyA therapy, although one of these two patients had shown monoclonality before therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Flow-cytometric analysis revealed a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> expression of GPI-linked membrane proteins, including CD55, CD59, and CD16 on PMN in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients treated with CyA, irrespective of response, except for one patient who had a small proportion of GPI-anchored membrane protein-negative cells before therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The proportion remained unchanged 41 months after hematologic recovery following CyA therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that successful therapy of AA with CyA may not be associated with a significant risk of developing late clonal complications, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0004818'>paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
