<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The bone marrow in the lumbar spine, pelvis, and proximal femora was examined in each case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One patient had a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> marrow signal intensity (SI) and pattern and was considered cured of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The other patients had varying numbers of focal low-SI areas interspersed with high-SI areas in the marrow of the spine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The pelves and proximal femora of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients had diffuse high-SI marrow without focal abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Biopsy of a lumbar vertebral body in one patient demonstrated that the focal low-SI areas may have been islands of active hematopoietic cells scattered in otherwise fatty marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> may prove to be a valuable, noninvasive method of following the response of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> to therapy; more investigation is necessary before this can be definitely concluded </plain></SENT>
