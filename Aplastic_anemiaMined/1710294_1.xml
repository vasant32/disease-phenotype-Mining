<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The sample consisted of 8 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005549'>congenital neutropenia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0340970" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Kostmann</z:e> type), 9 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> with miscellaneous causes (5 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> benign, 2 associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004313'>hypogammaglobulinemia</z:hpo>, 1 drug-induced, and 1 hypoplastic type), 3 with cyclic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo>, and 7 with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The rG-CSF was given subcutaneously (or in a few cases intravenously) at a dose of 2 micrograms/kg/day for 7 days and 5 micrograms/kg/day for additional 7 to 28 days in cases with poor response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The rG-CSF was effective in 18 of 27 cases (67%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005549'>congenital neutropenia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> responded less frequently and poorly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean level of absolute neutrophil counts of 8 <z:hpo ids='HP_0005549'>congenital neutropenia</z:hpo> cases increased from 88/microliters to 2,718/microliters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>That of 9 miscellaneous cases changed from 189/microliters to 7,224/microliters at a dose of 2 micrograms/kg/day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 7 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> cases pretreatment level of 220/microliters rose to 851/microliters, usually after increasing the dose up to 5 micrograms/kg/day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The rG-CSF was apparently effective in 3 cases of cyclic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In any type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo>, the effect was largely transient; after the discontinuation of rG-CSF, the absolute neutrophil counts tended to decrease to pretreatment levels within 1 to 2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The G-CSF was well tolerated, and only one case with mild lumbago and another with minimal elevation of transaminases were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the rG-CSF can be effective for treating various types of childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo>.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
