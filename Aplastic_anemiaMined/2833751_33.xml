<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Feline <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> virus (FeLV) C-Sarma (or FSC) is a prototype of subgroup C FeLVs, which induce fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> in outbred specific-pathogen-free (SPF) cats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>FeLV C isolates also possess an extended host range in vitro, including an ability, unique among FeLVs, to replicate in guinea pig cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To identify the <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> determinants responsible for the pathogenicity and host range of FSC we constructed a series of proviral DNAs by exchanging gene fragments between FSC and FeLV-61E (or F6A), the latter of which is minimally pathogenic and whose host range in vitro is restricted to feline cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transfer of an 886-base-pair (bp) fragment of FSC, encompassing the codons for 73 amino acids at the 3' end of pol (the integrase/endonuclease gene) and the codons for 241 amino acids of the N-terminal portion of env [the extracellular <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> (gp70) gene], into the F6A genome was sufficient to confer onto chimeric viruses the ability to induce fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> in SPF cats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, no chimera lacking this sequence induced disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When assayed in vitro, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> chimeric viruses containing the 886-bp fragment of FSC acquired the ability to replicate in heterologous cells, including dog and guinea pig cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, the pathogenic and the host range determinants of the feline <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> retrovirus colocalize to a 3' pol-5' env region of the FSC genome and likely reside within a region encoding 241 amino acid residues of the N terminus of the extracellular <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
