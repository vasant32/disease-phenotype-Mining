<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Decreased numbers of CD4(+)CD25(+) FOXP3(+) T cells (Tregs) are associated with impaired immune homeostasis and development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The transcription factors FOXP3 and NFAT1 have key roles in regulatory T-cell development and function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We show that Tregs are decreased at presentation in almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>; FOXP3 protein and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels also are significantly lower in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and NFAT1 protein levels are decreased or absent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transfection of FOXP3-deficient CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells from patients with a plasmid encoding <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> NFAT1 resulted in increased FOXP3 expression in these cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By NFAT1 knockdown in CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells, FOXP3 expression was decreased when NFAT1 expression was decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our findings indicate that decreased NFAT1 could explain low FOXP3 expression and diminished Treg frequency in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treg defects are now implicated in autoimmune marrow failure </plain></SENT>
