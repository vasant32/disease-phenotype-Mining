<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>uEPO and rhEPO were purified to apparent homogeneity from the urine of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and from the conditioned medium of Chinese hamster ovary (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="29327">CHO</z:chebi>) cells transfected with a cDNA clone for human EPO, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The microheterogeneous nature of both factors, observed on isoelectric focusing, is derived from the difference of the number of terminal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26667">sialic acid</z:chebi> residues bound to the carbohydrate chains of the EPO molecule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary structure of rhEPO, consisting of 165 amino acid residues, was determined, and the C-terminal arginine predicted from the cDNA sequence was confirmed to be missing, as described previously (Recny et al </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three N-glycosylation and one O-glycosylation sites of both factors were determined as Asn24, Asn38, and Asn83 and Ser126, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48343">disulfide</z:chebi> linkages are located between Cys7 and Cys161, and between Cys29 and Cys33, in both EPOs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Hematogenic potencies of rhEPO and uEPO compared in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and in partially nephrectomized rats were approximately the same </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Both factors also stimulated the colony formation of CFU-E, BFU-E, and CFU-Meg in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>From these results, it is concluded that rhEPO produced in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29327">CHO</z:chebi> cells transfected with cDNA clone for human EPO is indistinguishable from uEPO physicochemically and biologically, and is valuable for further research and for clinical use </plain></SENT>
