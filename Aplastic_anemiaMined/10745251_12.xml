<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The precise replication site of TTV, however, has not been established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, the presence of TTV in liver autopsy material, and in bone marrow biopsy and autopsy samples taken from a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011011'>subacute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> patient was determined by PCR and Southern blot analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Liver cells were found to contain only TTV DNA and not <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow material, especially that taken at biopsy, contained high levels of TTV DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that the TTV replication site was in the bone marrow rather than in the liver, and that TTV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> was the cause of this patient's <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The precise etiological association of TTV with <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> remains to be established </plain></SENT>
