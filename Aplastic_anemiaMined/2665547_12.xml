<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients were prepared for BMT with high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> followed by 7.5 Gy single-dose irradiation; AA patients received total lymphoid irradiation (TLI), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> patients received total body irradiation (TBI) </plain></SENT>
