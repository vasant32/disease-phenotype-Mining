<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nine patients were conditioned with decreased dosage of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressive agents</z:chebi> of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="3498">CTX</z:chebi> (60 mg/kg) and ALG (120 mg/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The prophylaxis of GVHD consisted of standard CsA and MTX </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients have a media age of 25.3 yr (range: 15-37), and a median weight of 57.2 kg (range: 52.5-60) at the time of transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cord blood searches were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> conducted at Guangzhou Cord Blood Bank </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The engraftment state of the donor cells into recipients was confirmed by microsatellite DNA fingerprinting and fluorescent quantitative PCR analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Engrafted evidence has been found in seven patients involved by biomolecular analyses showing donor-recipient mixed chimerism post-transplant which was stable and persistent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After a median follow up of 32.2 months (range: 4-69), seven patients were alive and disease free </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study shows that durable donor-recipient stable mixed chimerism can be achieved by unrelated CBSCT in patients with SAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Umbilical cord blood could be employed as a source of hematopoietic stem cell for adult transplantation </plain></SENT>
