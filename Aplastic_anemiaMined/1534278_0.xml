<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A nationwide cooperative incidence survey of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> was carried out by the Institute of Hematology, CAMS, from 1986 to 1988 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cooperative survey network covered 46 investigating areas, involving 22 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>More than 60 million person-years were supervised and 1670 new cases identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The annual incidence rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> was 2.76/10(5) and the 95% confidence interval of population rate ranged from 2.63/10(5) to 2.89/10(5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidence rates in oil fields and polluted areas were significantly higher than those in other areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The incidence rate of ANLL was 1.62/10(5); ALL, 0.69/10(5); <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>, 0.36/10(5); CLL, 0.05/10(5); and special types, 0.03/10(5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The incidence rate and constituent ratio of CLL were significantly lower than those in Europe and America </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A peak of ALL incidence rate before age 10 was seen; this rate then declined with increasing age until 30 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, the incidence rates of other <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> rose with age reaching peaks at old age (50-70) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> rate in males was significantly higher than that in females, both in youth (10-29), caused by ALL, and at old age (greater than or equal to 60), mainly caused by ANLL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The incidence rates of ANLL subtypes (including M2b) are also reported </plain></SENT>
