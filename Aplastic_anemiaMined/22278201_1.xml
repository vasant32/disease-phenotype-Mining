<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Human leukocyte antigen-matched bone marrow transplant in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> is generally not feasible in developing countries due to lack of resources and expertise and immunosuppressive therapy (IST) has been used as an alternative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study aims to report the long-term outcome of children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> treated with IST [antithymocyte globulin (ATG) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi>] in our hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PROCEDURE: Case files of children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> who received IST from January 2001 to November 2009 were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-five patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (14 very severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>; 21 severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>) were given IST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seven patients expired within 3 months of therapy and were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The analysis was done in 28 patients (24 male and 4 female; 12 very severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and 16 severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median age was 10 years (range, 5 to 12 y) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ten patients achieved partial response and 4 patients complete response at 1 year with overall response rate of 50% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three nonresponders received a second course of ATG after 12 months out of which 2 responded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Hence, overall response including second course was 16 (57%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Three patients relapsed after a median interval of 23 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The median duration of follow-up of 16 responders was 40 months (range, 15 to 119 mo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In the patients with long-term follow-up for &gt;4 years (n = 7), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> were surviving and independent of transfusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In a developing country setting, IST with ATG and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> seems to be a good alternative treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> in children </plain></SENT>
