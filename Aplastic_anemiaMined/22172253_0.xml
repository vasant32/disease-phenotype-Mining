<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> were enrolled, among whom 30 received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> treatment (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> group) and 20 were treated with conventional methods (conventional group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty healthy children were enrolled as the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The expression of CD4(+)CD25(+)CD127(low) Treg cells was detected by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expression of Foxp3 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was detected by real-time Q-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The expressions of Foxp3 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and CD4(+)CD25(+)CD127(low)Treg cells showed no significant difference between the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> and the control groups 6 months after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, there were significantly lower expressions of both in the conventional group than in the control group (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> group had significantly higher expressions of Foxp3 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and CD4(+)CD25(+)CD127(low) Treg cells than the conventional group (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The expressions of CD4(+)CD25(+)CD127(low) Treg cells and Foxp3 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> increase after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
