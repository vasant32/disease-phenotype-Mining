<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Over the 15-yr period, 1972-1986, 194 episodes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004610" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bacteremia</z:e> occurred in 132 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> at the Third Department of Medicine, Kanazawa University Hospital, giving an incidence of 478 episodes per 1,000 hospital admissions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This incidence was at least twice as high as that in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005558'>chronic leukemia</z:hpo>, malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, and about 40-fold higher than that in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other internal diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The rate of occurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004610" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bacteremia</z:e>, whether unimicrobial or polymicrobial, remained almost unchanged throughout the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The frequency of <z:mp ids='MP_0001795'>gram-negative</z:mp> bacilli decreased significantly, however, from 81% of the total isolates for the first 10-yr period to 50% for the second 5-yr period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were isolated in markedly decreasing frequency, but Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter cloacae in relatively constant frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The majority of P. aeruginosa isolates belonged to a limited number of O-antigen groups, suggesting the possibility of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0205721" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">nosocomial infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the frequency of <z:mp ids='MP_0001796'>gram-positive</z:mp> cocci increased from 9 to 36% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus species, and Staphylococcus aureus emerged as important pathogens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Such a change in the spectrum of organisms was considered to coincide with the common use of the so-called second- and third-generation <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23066">cephalosporins</z:chebi> and central venous catheters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is thus suggested that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28001">vancomycin</z:chebi> be added to empiric antibiotic therapy, especially when <z:mp ids='MP_0001796'>gram-positive</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> are clinically or microbiologically suspected, and that reducing the acquisition of P. aeruginosa from the hospital environment remains a priority in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> prevention </plain></SENT>
