<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had initial evidence of engraftment after the first transplantation except for one patient who died of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> due to CY on the third day after transplantation and could not be evaluated for engraftment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rejection later occurred in four of these 14 patients, who then underwent successful regrafting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One of these patients, who was conditioned with CY alone at the first grafting, underwent successful regrafting after a conditioning regimen of CY and TBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the other three patients, irradiation was performed twice as the conditioning regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, 14 of 15 patients underwent successful BMT and are alive with restored hematopoietic function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>From the above results, the combination of TLI or TBI and CY was considered to be very useful as a conditioning regimen for BMT in patients with SAA </plain></SENT>
