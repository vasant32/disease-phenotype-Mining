<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The expression of CD28 and CTLA4 on T cells incubated with or without PHA was detected by two-color flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The expression of CD28 and CTLA4 was significantly increased after PHA stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the AA mice, the expression of CD28 with or without PHA stimulation was both higher than that in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mice (both P &lt; 0.01), but the expression of CTLA4 with or without PHA stimulation showed no significant difference in comparison to that in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mice (both P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the AA mice, there were more activation and activated potential of T cells than the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, and the abnormal expression of CD28 and CTLA4 may participate in immunological disorder mediated by T cells </plain></SENT>
