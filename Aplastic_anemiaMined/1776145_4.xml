<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To get a better understanding of this disorder in the Netherlands we conducted a national retrospective study over a 25-year period (1963 till 1989) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The medical reports of 19 patients who fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for CHA were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were diagnosed during the first three months of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Dysmaturity was found in 50% of the patients and in 25% physical anomalies were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 17 patients the bone marrow showed a hypoplastic erythropoiesis, but in 2 patients erythropoiesis was quantitatively <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> and 74% of them responded initially </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Five of these patients (26%) had a complete remission and 4 of them (21%) are in remission on low dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> maintenance-treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Remarkably one patient went only into remission at the age of 17 years </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This study further shows that the chance of achieving a remission was positively correlated with an early start of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> treatment and negatively with the manifestation of symptoms on the first day of life </plain></SENT>
