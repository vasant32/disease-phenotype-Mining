<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cooperative survey network covered 44 investigating areas, involving 21 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>More than 52 million person-years were supervised and 387 new cases identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The annual incidence rate was 0.74/10(5) and the 95% confidence interval of the population rate ranged from 0.67/10(5) to 0.82/10(5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidence rate of AA in coal mines was higher than that in other areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The incidence rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (CAA) was 0.60/10(5) and that of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AAA) was 0.14/10(5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were incidence peaks of CAA at older ages; at age 50-59 in females, but after 60 in males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The incidence rate of CAA in males decreased obviously at age 40-49 and that in females rose clearly at age 10-19, while the incidence rate of CAA in males was generally higher than that in females </plain></SENT>
