<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The annual incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0000334'>agranulocytosis</z:mp> ranged from 1.1 to 4.9 cases per million, and that of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, from 0.7 to 4.1 per million; the inverse correlation was consistent among the regions (R2 = 0.74) </plain></SENT>
