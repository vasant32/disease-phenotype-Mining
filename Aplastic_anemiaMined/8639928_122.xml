<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study was performed to determine pregnancy outcome among patients who had received high-dose chemotherapy alone or with total-body irradiation (TBI) and marrow transplantation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Records of 1,326 postpubertal and 196 prepubertal patients currently more than 12 years of age after marrow transplant in Seattle from August 1971 to January 1992 were reviewed to determine the patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> gonadal function and pregnancies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among 708 postpubertal women, 110 recovered <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ovarian function and 32 became pregnant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, nine formerly prepubertal girls with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> gonadal function became pregnant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among 618 postpubertal men, 157 recovered testicular function and partners of 33 became pregnant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An additional two formerly prepubertal men had partners who became pregnant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Forty-one female patients and partners of 35 male patients had 146 pregnancies after transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 76 patients responded to a questionnaire requesting pregnancy history, outcome, infant birth weight, and congenital anomalies information for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> clinically recognized pregnancies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were 115 live births among 146 (79%) pregnancies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0005268'>Spontaneous abortion</z:hpo> terminated four of 56 (7%) pregnancies for 28 female <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (CY) recipients and six of 16 (37%) pregnancies for 13 TBI recipients (P = .02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Partners of 28 male CY recipients had four of 62 (6.4%) pregnancies terminate with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005268'>spontaneous abortion</z:hpo>, but there were no <z:hpo ids='HP_0005268'>spontaneous abortions</z:hpo> among eight pregnancies of five TBI recipients' partners </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001622'>Preterm delivery</z:hpo> occurred for eight of 44 (18%) and five of eight (63%) live births for 24 CY and eight TBI female recipients (P = .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This 25% incidence among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> female patient pregnancies is higher than the expected incidence of 8% to 10% (P = .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The 13 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001622'>preterm deliveries</z:hpo> resulted in 10 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001518'>low birth weight</z:hpo> ([LBW] 1.8 to 2.24 kg) and three very <z:hpo ids='HP_0001518'>low birth weight</z:hpo> ([VLBW] &lt; or = 1.36 kg) infants, for an overall incidence of 25%, which is higher than the expected incidence of 6.5% for the general population (P = .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Twelve of the 13 premature infants survive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Congenital anomalies were seen among two of 52 (3.8%) live-born infants of female and six of 63 (9.5%) live-born infants of male patients, which is not different from the 13% of single congenital anomalies reported for the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>These data demonstrate that clinically recognized pregnancies among women who have received a marrow transplant incorporating TBI are likely to be accompanied by an increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005268'>spontaneous abortion</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Pregnancies among <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> women who received a marrow transplant are likely to be accompanied by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022876" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">preterm labor</z:e> and delivery of LBW or VLBW babies who do not seem to be at an increased risk of congenital anomalies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>However, determination of possible adverse effects of parental exposure to high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agents</z:chebi> with or without TBI on children born posttransplant requires longer, additional follow-up </plain></SENT>
