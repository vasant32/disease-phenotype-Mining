<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since some of the etiological factors are shared by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026986" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MDS">preleukemic syndrome</z:e>, there is a strong possibility that a proportion of cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> may in fact be <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026986,C0033027" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">preleukemia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study of chromosomes offers a relatively easy method of detecting cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026986,C0033027" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">preleukemia</z:e>, because some chromosomal abnormalities are frequently observed in this condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Chromosomal studies were carried out in peripheral blood cell cultures of 31 patients with otherwise typical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Chromosomal abnormalities were detected in 7 (22.5%) cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most common chromosomal abnormality detected was <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8, seen in four cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Other abnormalities detected were 22q-, t(14;22) and t(15;21), in one case each </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These abnormalities have been found to be associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, ALL, and NHL as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that a proportion of cases of otherwise typical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> may in fact be due to a leukemic process in evolution </plain></SENT>
