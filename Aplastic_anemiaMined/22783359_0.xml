<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The criteria by Camitta for diagnosis in severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (SAA) has been used since 1976 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there has been no attempt to verify the Camitta's criteria, that the survival in patients with SAA may differ by absolute neutrophil count (ANC), platelet count (PLT), and corrected reticulocyte count (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e>), which are components of the Camitta's criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 117 SAA patients diagnosed by the Camitta's criteria were analyzed, retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to evaluate the factors affecting overall survival (OS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Response by immunosuppressive therapy (IST) or stem cell transplantation (SCT) significantly affected OS (P=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we excluded treatment responders for analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, 92 SAA patients including treatment non-responders by IST or SCT and conservative care group were analyzed by using univariate and multivariate analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median age of analyzed patients was 54.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Male to female ratio was 1:1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up duration was 74.23 months (range, 54.71-93.74 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The median ANC, PLT, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CRC</z:e> were 394/µL, 12,000/µL, and 0.39%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analyses, ANC &lt;500/µL or ≥500/µL (P=0.015, HR 2.694, 95% CI: 1.20-6.01) and age (P=0.015, HR 1.022, 95% CI: 1.00-1.04) were the significant factors for OS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: ANC could be an essential, not an optional criterion for diagnosing SAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This study suggests the possibility that the Camitta's criteria be modified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Studies in large cohorts are needed to transform the Camitta's criteria </plain></SENT>
