<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Transcriptional factor GATA-2 plays several important roles in both hematopoiesis and adipogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Decreased levels of GATA-2 compromise the proliferation and survival of hematopoietic stem cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>GATA-2 suppresses adipocyte differentiation through direct inhibition of adipogenic factors, including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have shown that expression of GATA-2 is decreased in marrow CD34-positive cells in AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To elucidate the mechanisms of fatty marrow replacement, we evaluated the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression for GATA-2 and PPARgamma in mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from patients with AA by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>GATA-2 expression by MSCs from AA patients was significantly lower than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conversely, expression of PPARgamma was significantly higher in AA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Western blot analysis demonstrated that protein levels of GATA-2 were lower in AA patients than those in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, incubation with interferon-gamma induced downregulation of GATA-2 levels in MSCs from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that fatty marrow replacement in AA patients can be explained by downregulation of GATA-2 and overexpression of PPARgamma in MSCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Decreased expression of GATA-2 might be responsible for the pathogenesis and development of the clinical features of the disease </plain></SENT>
