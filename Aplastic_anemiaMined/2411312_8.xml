<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have characterized the antibody specificities contained in one lot of Swiss ATDLG found to provide a response rate of 69% and another lot that provided only a 31% response rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Antibody specificities were analyzed quantitatively by competitive inhibition assays with the use of a panel of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi>-conjugated murine monoclonal antibodies that recognize T cell antigens, common leukocyte antigens, and "la-like" antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although there was wide variation in the amounts of individual antibody specificities within each lot, the effective lot of ATDLG contained an average of 2 1/2 times as much of each antibody specificity as the less effective lot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were only two antibody specificities that differed remarkably from this pattern; and these deviations did not appear sufficient to account for the variation in ATDLG efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is possible that antibody specificities other than those tested were responsible for therapeutic efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, the data suggest that it might be possible to achieve improved results for the treatment of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> with higher doses of less effective lots of ATDLG </plain></SENT>
