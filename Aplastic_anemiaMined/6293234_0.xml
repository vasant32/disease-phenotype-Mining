<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On the basis of the growth pattern three types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026986" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MDS">preleukaemic syndrome</z:e> (PL) and two types of aplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> were distinguished </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Further evaluation of the bone marrow dysfunction was attempted with a combined application of cytochemistry and electron microscopy for the morphologic study of cells proliferating in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Well-defined maturation defects in the growing cells from the bone marrow of patients with PL were demonstrated with cytochemical stainings performed in agar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results were supported by electron microscopic findings of Auer-body-like inclusions in "statu nascendi" in the vacuoles of preleukaemic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the basis of our results a high risk group of PL for development of overt <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> and a group of patients with a grave prognosis in aplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> were distinguished </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The data obtained are relevant for the clinical diagnosis and prognosis of patients with cytopenias </plain></SENT>
