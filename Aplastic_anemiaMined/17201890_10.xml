<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>Thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> is a common manifestation of liver <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo> (LC), but its underlying mechanism is not fully understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present paper was to evaluate the platelet kinetics in LC patients by examining several non-invasive convenient markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty-seven LC patients, 32 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001973'>idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi>), 12 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA), and 29 healthy individuals were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Plasma thrombopoietin was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Absolute reticulated platelet (RP) count and plasma glycocalicin were used as indices for thrombopoiesis, and the indices for platelet turnover were the RP proportion and the plasma glycocalicin normalized to the individual platelet count (GCI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no difference in thrombopoietin levels between LC patients and healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The RP proportion and GCI were significantly higher and the absolute RP count and glycocalicin significantly lower in LC patients than in healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These markers in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> and LC patients were comparable, but significantly different from those in AA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The bone marrow megakaryocyte density in LC and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> patients was similar, and significantly higher than in AA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Cirrhotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> is a multifactorial condition involving accelerated platelet turnover and moderately impaired thrombopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thrombopoietin deficiency is unlikely to be the primary contributor to cirrhotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
