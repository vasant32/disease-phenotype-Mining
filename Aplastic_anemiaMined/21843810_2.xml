<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> metabolites are known to induce <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and disrupt the cell cycle, the mechanism underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0598766" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">leukemogenesis</z:e> is not fully understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to analyze the genome-wide expression profiles of human promyelocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60 cells that had been exposed to <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> and its metabolites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This was carried out using whole human genome oligonucleotide microarrays to ascertain potential biomarkers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Genes that were differentially expressed (&gt;1.5-fold and p-values &lt;0.05) after exposure to <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> (BZ), <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17594">hydroquinone</z:chebi> (HQ), and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16509">1,4-benzoquinone</z:chebi> (BQ) were then classified with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GO</z:e>, KEGG and GSEA pathway annotation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> genes that were identified were then functionally categorized as being involved in the cell cycle, the p53 signaling pathway, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, the MAPK signaling pathway, or the T cell receptor signaling pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Functionally important genes were further validated by means of real-time RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results showed that EGR1, PMAIP1, AR, CCL2, CD69, HSPA8, SLC7A11, HERPUD1, ELK1, and MKI57 genes altered their expression profiles </plain></SENT>
