<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They are termed "Colony forming Unit, CFUC", and such cells are detectable in bone marrow and peripheral blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow cells from 15 control patients with regular myelopoiesis contained 86 +/- 46 CFUC/10(5) bone marrow cells and 23 +/- 14 CFUC/ml blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 10 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, only 0-10, 5 CFUC/10(5) BM-cells were found and no CFUC were detectable in the peripheral blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>17 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> showed a moderate elevation of bone marrow CFUC (X = 105), while the circulating CFUC were markedly elevated (105-42.000/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The circulating CFUC were closely correlated with the number of leukocytes (p less than 0,001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 12 patients with primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948968" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">osteomyelofibrosis</z:e>, the number of circulating CFUC was also (raised (325-22.199/ml) and again, a correlation with the number of leukocytes was observed (p less than 0,05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As, on the other hand, there was no difference in the leukocyte count between the control group and patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0238293" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">osteomyelosclerosis</z:e>, the simultaneous assessment of circulating leukocytes and CFUC proves a diagnostic tool </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>Pancytopenia</z:hpo> with a hypercellular bone marrow results from either neoplastic or metabolic alterations of haemopoiesis; in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> with neoplastic infiltration or transformation, the number of CFUC was lowered, whereas it was slightly elevated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> due to metabolic alterations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath>, only a minority of cells was capable of proliferation in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The growth of leukaemic cells in culture, their prolonged survival along with the expression of functional properties may be clinically used for a more subtle classification of blast populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The data on patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> indicate, that basic mechanisms of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> blood cell regulation operate in leukaemic haemopoiesis as well </plain></SENT>
