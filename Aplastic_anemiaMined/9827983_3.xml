<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SAA was discovered in a 4-year-old girl in February 1990 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Transfusion support started in August 1990 and standard treatments were unsuccessful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The birth of an HLA-compatible brother in October 1993 permitted the cryopreservation of UCB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In December 1994 UCB transplantation was decided upon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No toxicity occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>G-CSF was started at day 28 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>WBC and PMN reached 0.5 x 10(9)/l at days 33 and 37 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RBC and platelet transfusion independence were reached at days 50 and 52 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mixed chimerism was demonstrated in blood cells at 1.5, 4 and 6 months after UCBT by molecular biology (VNTR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>FISH studies yielded similar results at 15 and 18 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Twenty months after UCBT, molecular biology showed full donor chimerism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Clinical follow-up (last follow-up: 32 months post transplant) is unremarkable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>We suggest that CY and ATG may be a suitable regimen for related HLA-compatible UCBT in patients with SAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Residual recipient cells can disappear even very late after UCBT, permitting the establishment of complete donor chimerism </plain></SENT>
