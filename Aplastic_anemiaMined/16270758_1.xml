<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Immunosuppression is the most effective treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the combination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> and antithymocyte globulin (ATG) is superior to either agent alone, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> monotherapy is an easily available, safe and cheap immunosuppressive therapy (IST) option </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These advantages are particularly valuable in developing countries where ATG is frequently not available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: In the referral hematology center in Yemen, 20 patients (16 males and 4 females) with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (SAA) were prospectively identified and managed with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> monotherapy during the period between April 2001 and November 2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Data from 14 patients who received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> for at least 3 months were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At 6 months, 2 (14.3%) patients achieved complete remission (CR) and 5 (35.7%) patients achieved partial remission (PR) and at 1 year, 4 (28.6%) patients achieved CR and 3 (21.4%) patients remained in PR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The overall response rate was 50% and the cumulative survival rate at 1 year was 78.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median time to remission was 120 days (range, 46 to 131 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Side effects were modest and easily monitored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results support findings that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> monotherapy is an effective and safe immunosuppressive therapy for SAA, and that it could be a reasonable IST option for patients in developing countries </plain></SENT>
