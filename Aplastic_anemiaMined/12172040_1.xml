<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Seven (28%) of 25 AA patients who received BMT from HLA-identical sibling donors developed late graft failure at a median of 7 months (range, 2.0-9.3 months) after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients with graft failure were treated with PBSC collected from the original donor after mobilization with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median boost dose of peripheral blood mononuclear cells was 3.1 x 10(8)/kg (range, 1.4-11.9 x 10(8)/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median times to reach an absolute neutrophil count greater than 0.5 x 10(9)/L and a platelet count greater than 50 x 10(9)/L were 7 days (range, 4-14 days) and 9 days (range, 3-41 days), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was sustained graft function in 6 of 7 patients, with a median follow-up duration of 3.3 yr (range, 1.0-6.2 yr) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Grade-I <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) occurred in 2 patients, while extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD developed in 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This report shows that G-CSF-mobilized allogeneic PBSC rescue is very effective in achieving complete and sustained engraftment in patients with AA after graft failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, more efficacious measures to prevent extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD remain to be developed </plain></SENT>
