<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One patient (female, age 33 years) had bilateral involvement due to systemic steroid use, the other (male, age 39 years) had right-sided involvement of unknown etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Surgical treatment was ruled out because of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> associated with significant thrombocyte deficiency in the first patient, while the other refused surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pulsed electromagnetic fields were applied as the sole treatment modality in three hips for six months with a duration of 10 hours daily (at nights) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At the end of 12-year- and five-year-follow-ups, respectively, clinical improvement was observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> hips, with no radiologic deterioration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that application of PEMF stimulation alone may be an alternative treatment modality in patients in whom surgical treatment cannot be performed for femoral head <z:hpo ids='HP_0010885'>osteonecrosis</z:hpo>, in particular Ficat-Arlet grade 1 and 2 disease </plain></SENT>
