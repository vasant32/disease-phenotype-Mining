<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Selective inhibition of intestinal MTP is achieved via rapid hydrolysis of its <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">ester</z:chebi> linkage by liver-specific carboxylesterase(s), resulting in the formation of an inactive <z:chebi fb="1" ids="33575">carboxylic acid</z:chebi> metabolite 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the course of discovery efforts around tissue-specific inhibitors of MTP, the mechanism of JTT-130 hydrolysis was examined in detail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Lack of ¹⁸O incorporation in 1 following the incubation of JTT-130 in human liver microsomes in the presence of H₂¹⁸O suggested that hydrolysis did not occur via a simple cleavage of the <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">ester</z:chebi> linkage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The characterization of atropic acid (2-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27386">phenylacrylic acid</z:chebi>) as a metabolite was consistent with a hydrolytic pathway involving initial hydrolysis of one of the pendant malonate ethyl <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">ester</z:chebi> groups followed by decarboxylative fragmentation to 1 and the concomitant liberation of the potentially electrophilic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="37080">acrylate</z:chebi> species </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">Glutathione</z:chebi> conjugates of atropic acid and its ethyl <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">ester</z:chebi> were also observed in microsomal incubations of JTT-130 that were supplemented with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29256">thiol</z:chebi> nucleophile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Additional support for the hydrolysis mechanism was obtained from analogous studies on diethyl 2-(2-(2-(3-(dimethylcarbamoyl)-4-(4'-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="50127">trifluoromethyl</z:chebi>)-[<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17097">1,1'-biphenyl</z:chebi>]-2-ylcarboxamido)<z:chebi fb="1" ids="30396">phenyl</z:chebi>)<z:chebi fb="0" ids="48076">acetoxy</z:chebi>)ethyl)-2-phenylmalonate (3), which cannot participate in hydrolysis via the fragmentation pathway because of the additional <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50728">methylene group</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Unlike the case with JTT-130, ¹⁸O was readily incorporated into 1 during the enzymatic hydrolysis of 3, suggestive of a mechanism involving direct hydrolytic cleavage of the <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">ester</z:chebi> group in 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Finally, 3-(ethylamino)-2-(ethylcarbamoyl)-3-oxo-2-phenylpropyl 2-(3-(dimethylcarbamoyl)-4-(4'-(<z:chebi fb="0" ids="50127">trifluoromethyl</z:chebi>)-[<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17097">1,1'-biphenyl</z:chebi>]-2-ylcarboxamido)<z:chebi fb="1" ids="30396">phenyl</z:chebi>)<z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> (4), which possessed an N,N-diethyl-2-phenylmalonamide substituent (in lieu of the diethyl-2-phenylmalonate motif in JTT-130) proved to be resistant to the hydrolytic cleavage/decarboxylative fragmentation pathway that yielded 1, a phenomenon that further confirmed our hypothesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>From a toxicological standpoint, it is noteworthy to point out that the liberation of the electrophilic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18308">acrylic acid</z:chebi> species as a byproduct of JTT-130 hydrolysis is similar to the bioactivation mechanism established for felbamate, an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">anticonvulsant</z:chebi> agent associated with idiosyncratic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0235378,C0348754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Injury or Poisoning" abbrv="">hepatotoxicity</z:e> </plain></SENT>
