<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To determine the value of flt3 ligand (flt3L) in stimulating hematopoiesis in human hypoproliferative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005956" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bone marrow disorders</z:e>, we examined its in vitro effect on bone marrow cells from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Growth response to flt3L, alone and in combination with other hematopoietic growth factors, was investigated in clonogenic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53448">methylcellulose</z:chebi> assays, in long-term liquid and stroma cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow cells were derived from 13 AA patients with persisting in vitro growth defect after immunosuppressive treatment and from nine <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53448">methylcellulose</z:chebi> cultures, flt3L stimulated formation of hematopoietic colonies only weakly, whereas it had an additive effect when combined with erythropoietin (Epo), stem cell factor (SCF), interleukin-3 (IL-3), interleukin-11 (IL-11), or granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Flt3L was less effective than SCF and did not further enhance the number of hematopoietic colonies formed in response to SCF-containing combinations of multiple cytokines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In long-term liquid suspension cultures, flt3L was less mitogenic than SCF but its effect on the maintenance of progenitors was superior that of SCF and of IL-3, IL-11, and G-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The total number of clonogenic AA cells increased as much as four-fold during the first culture week and FACS analysis demonstrated expansion of the CD34+CD38+ progenitor cell subset </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Despite this enhancement, survival of AA cells remained significantly poorer than that of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells, in which the primitive subset of CD34+CD38- cells was maintained up to 4 weeks when flt3L was used as a single factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and AA cultures, flt3L promoted differentiation of cells of the myeloid lineages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In cultures of bone marrow stroma, flt3L had almost no effect on growth and survival of AA progenitors, while in cultures of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells the number of colony-forming cells increased up to 10-fold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although flt3L does not overcome the proliferative defect of AA precursors, we conclude that the ligand is capable of in vitro stimulation and expansion of the reduced progenitor cell pool in AA, when used in appropriate culture conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The in vitro effects of flt3L on AA cells differ in many aspects from those of the structurally related cytokine SCF, suggesting a benefit in use of a combination of these two early-acting growth factors </plain></SENT>
