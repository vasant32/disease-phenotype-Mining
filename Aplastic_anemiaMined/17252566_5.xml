<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Demonstrate that high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (CY) is effective therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo>-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (HAA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: HAA is a sequence of seronegative <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> followed by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Optimal treatment is matched-sibling allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The combination of antithymocyte globulin (ATG) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> (CSA) has also been studied, but there are scarce data regarding treatment of HAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PROCEDURE: Five patients (median age 14 years; range 6-17 years) with HAA and without an HLA-matched sibling were treated with high-dose CY (50 mg/kg/day IV x 4 days) followed by granulocyte-colony stimulation factor (G-CSF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After at least 1 year of follow-up, four of five patients are in remission without further immune suppression beyond high-dose CY </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the 4 responders, median time to absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;500 microl(-1) was 51 days (range 44-369) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Median time to transfusion independence for erythrocytes and platelets was 109 (range 57-679) and 160 (range 48-679) days, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The fifth patient did not respond and proceeded to an unrelated donor transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One patient met criteria for autoimmune <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> (AIH) in addition to HAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In this case, high-dose CY successfully induced remission of both diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: High-dose CY induces durable remissions in HAA and may be an effective treatment for AIH </plain></SENT>
