<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hematopoietic growth factors have often been included in IST supportive care, but prolonged exposure may increase the risk of secondary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516669" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">clonal evolution</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors evaluated response, survival, and the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516669" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">clonal evolution</z:e> following <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi>-based IST without hematopoietic growth factor exposure in a population-based pediatric cohort, identified retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Forty-five patients with a median age of 7.3 years (range 1.2-17.0 years) were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Partial (PR) and complete (CR) response was achieved in 82% and 64%, at a median of 55 days (range 11-414 days) and 7.6 months (range 2.8-82.2 months), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with associated seronegative <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> had an increased likelihood of PR and CR on multivariate analyses (PR: hazard ratio [HR] 3.15, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.40, 7.11; CR: HR 2.99, 95% CI 1.35, 6.62), whereas older children were less likely to achieve IST response than children younger than 5 years at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Five- and 10-year overall survival was 96% ± 4% and 90% ± 7%, respectively, and 5-year failure-free survival was 63% ± 8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>-related mortality, although 16.4% of patients had at least 1 episode of documented <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004610" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bacteremia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse was 12.9% and of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516669" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">clonal evolution</z:e> was 3.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The authors conclude that children with AA who receive IST without hematopoietic growth factor support have excellent response and survival outcomes and a low incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516669" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">clonal evolution</z:e> </plain></SENT>
