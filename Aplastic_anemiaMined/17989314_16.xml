<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We conducted a prospective multicenter study to compare the efficacy of repeated immunosuppressive therapy (IST) with stem-cell transplantation (SCT) from an alternative donor in children with acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) who failed to respond to an initial course of IST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with severe (n = 86) and very severe disease (n = 119) received initial IST consisting of antithymocyte globulin (ATG) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sixty patients failed to respond to IST after 6 months from the initial IST and were eligible for second-line treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among them, 21 patients lacking suitable donors received a second course of IST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three patients developed an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0340865" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">anaphylactoid reaction</z:e> to ATG and could not complete the second IST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A trilineage response was seen in only 2 of 18 (11%) evaluable patients after 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirty-one patients received SCT from an alternative donor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At 5 years from the initiation of second-line therapy, the estimated failure-free survival (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FFS</z:e>), defined as survival with response, was 83.9% (+/- 16.1%, SD) in the SCT group compared with 9.5% (+/- 9.0%) in the IST group (P = .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that SCT from an alternative donor offers a better chance of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FFS</z:e> than a second IST in patients not responding to an initial IST </plain></SENT>
