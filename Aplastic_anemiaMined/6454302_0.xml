<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In mixed leukocyte culture, her cell were unresponsive to unrelated control stimulating cells, but responded well to a pool of cells from the same unrelated controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>She had reduced production of lymphocyte mitogenic factor (MF), suggesting a helper cell defect, and she had few or no cells reactive with the monoclonal anti-T cell antibodies OKT3, OKT4 or OKT5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Her cells proliferated in response to MF produced by a pool of cells without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>, however </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, her cells became specifically cytotoxic when stimulated by cells plus MF, but not when stimulated by either cells or MF alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus her <z:mp ids='MP_0001831'>T cell deficiency</z:mp> was correctable by nonspecific helper factor in vitro </plain></SENT>
