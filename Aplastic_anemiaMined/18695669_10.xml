<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This was attributed to the combination of lower graft cell dose and intact host immune system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed UCBT in nine children (median age 9 years) with refractory SAA using increasingly immunosuppressive preparative regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The time from diagnosis to UCBT was 3.4-20 months (median age 7.2 years), with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> children having failed at least one course of immunosuppression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Donor/recipient HLA matching was six of six (n=1), five of six (n=2) and four of six (n=6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median nucleated cell dose infused was 5.7 x 10(7) cells/kg (range 3.5-20 x 10(7) cells/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Six patients were engrafted after the first UCBT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two of the three patients without hematopoietic reconstitution were engrafted after a second UCBT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> children receiving &gt;or=120 mg/kg of CY in the preparative regimen were engrafted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The median time to myeloid engraftment was 25 (17-59 days) days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> GVHD developed in two, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD in five patients </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>At a median follow-up of 34 months, seven patients are alive and transfusion-independent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>UCBT is a feasible treatment strategy for children with refractory SAA lacking a well-matched adult donor </plain></SENT>
