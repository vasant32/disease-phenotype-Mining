<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sixty-five patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, 16 with Ewing's <z:hpo ids='HP_0100242'>sarcoma</z:hpo>, and 19 with recurrent undifferentiated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Each patient received at least 10 U of platelets (mean of 72) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HLA antibodies were detected in 31% (20/65) of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo>, 12% (2/16) of the Ewing's, and 26% (5/19) of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fourteen of the 27 patients who developed antibodies became antibody negative again within 2 mo and remained so </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in quantity of platelet transfusions between antibody-negative patients and alloimmunized patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A smaller group (n = 8) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> patients followed at the NCl exhibited a frequency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948201" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">alloimmunization</z:e> of 88% (7/8) after a mean of 44 U of platelets were transfused </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Granulocyte transfusions given therapeutically for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001913'>granulocytopenia</z:hpo> and documented <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> did not appear to influence HLA antibody formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that significant immunosuppression occurs in intensively treated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients, as measured by their ability to from antibodies to HLA antigens expressed on the surface of transfused platelets </plain></SENT>
