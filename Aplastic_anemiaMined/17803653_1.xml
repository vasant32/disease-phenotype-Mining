<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the current study quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and immunostaining were used simultaneously to examine the relationship between WT1 <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> and protein level and also to evaluate WT1 as a tool to differentiate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three types of WT1 messages (total, exon 5(+) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">KTS</z:e>(+)) and WT1 immunostaining of these diseases were analyzed </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No significant difference was observed between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and RA, except for exon 5 message </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three WT1 message levels had a significant correlation, suggesting that the total WT1 message is sufficient for clinical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Positive immunostaining of WT1 was observed only in the portion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> and overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (OL) transformed from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> with a high WT1 message level, suggesting the relatively high detection threshold of WT1 protein with the immunostaining method </plain></SENT>
