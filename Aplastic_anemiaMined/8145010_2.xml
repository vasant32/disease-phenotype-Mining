<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hierarchical subpopulations can be identified by analyzing the kinetics of cell regeneration and the specific cellular requirement for cytokines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, a new type of HPP-CFC, termed high-proliferative potential mixed colony-forming unit-megakaryocyte (HPP-mCFU-MK), was detected in murine bone marrow cell cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The HPP-mCFU-MK was able to form macroscopic colonies that fit the criteria of the HPP-CFC colony but contained a number of megakaryocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Its growth was stimulated by either <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> serum (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AAS</z:e>) or a combination of three or more recombinant hematopoietic growth factors but was not inhibited by transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) and platelet factor 4 (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30203">PF4</z:chebi>) in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The recloning of the 12-day-old HPP-mCFU-MK colonies picked up from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AAS</z:e>-stimulated primary cultures caused secondary formation of HPP-CFC colonies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that HPP-mCFC-MK is a new subset of stem cell characterized by its ability to produce directly a number of megakaryocytes in response to multifactor stimulation, to generate a secondary set of HPP-CFC in replating culture, and to be unaffected by TGF-beta 1 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30203">PF4</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
