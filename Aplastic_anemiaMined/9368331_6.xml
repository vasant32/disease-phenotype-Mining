<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Point mutations in the gene for the G-CSF receptor have been reported previously in a subgroup of patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0005549'>congenital neutropenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we investigated the frequency of these specific G-CSF receptor mutations in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027947" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neutropenic disorders</z:e> undergoing treatment with recombinant human (r-metHu)G-CSF (Filgrastim) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="9" ids="36976">Nucleotides</z:chebi> 2306 to 2561, including the critical region (<z:chebi fb="9" ids="36976">nucleotides</z:chebi> 2384-2429) from the intracellular domain of the G-CSF receptor gene, were amplified by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, and DNA was sequenced directly and after transformation in E. coli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four of 30 patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0005549'>congenital neutropenia</z:hpo> displayed a point mutation in the tested cytoplasmic region of the G-CSF receptor gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two of the four patients with a mutated G-CSF receptor developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> secondary to <z:hpo ids='HP_0005549'>congenital neutropenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>G-CSF receptor analyses were performed in myeloid cells taken at different time points in the four patients with the mutated receptor, and no correlation between occurrence of the mutation and time or dose of r-metHuG-CSF treatment was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No point mutations in the G-CSF receptor critical domain could be detected in cells from the other 26 <z:hpo ids='HP_0005549'>congenital neutropenia</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additionally, no G-CSF receptor point mutations could be seen in neutrophils, blood and bone marrow mononuclear cells from patients with cyclic or idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo>, and bone marrow mononuclear cells from patients suffering from severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Similar results were obtained by Touw et al., demonstrating that five out of 25 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005549'>congenital neutropenia</z:hpo> reveal G-CSF receptor mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data show that the point mutations in the critical region of the intracellular part of the G-CSF receptor occur only in a subgroup of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0005549'>congenital neutropenia</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, our data suggest that the described G-CSF receptor point mutations are not correlated with the start, duration or doses of r-metHuG-CSF treatment, but might result from genetic instability in the G-CSF receptor gene in severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0005549'>congenital neutropenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
