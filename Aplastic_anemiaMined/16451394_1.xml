<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the records of 153 Guadeloupean children with sickle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (SCA), for whom clinical and laboratory data were prospectively collected (mean follow-up duration 8.4 +/- 4.6 yr) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Prevalence and age-specific frequencies of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> clinical events were determined and correlations between complications, hematological parameters and potential modulating factors investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Painful crisis and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> chest syndrome (ACS) were the two most common complications, affecting 65.4% and 58.8% of the patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> was 49.7% (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1260402" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">splenic sequestration</z:e> 24.8%; <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> 15.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Prevalences of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_681'>septicemia</z:mpath>-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002754'>osteomyelitis</z:hpo> were 15.7% and 16.3%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A higher incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e>, painful crises and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> was detected in patients who developed ACS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The well-documented protective effect of HbF level on the overall disease expression was observed with higher HbF level in asymptomatic than in symptomatic patients (17.5% +/- 8% vs. 9.9% +/- 6.4%, P = 0.01) with similar ages and sex ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It was also confirmed on ACS and, for the first time, further extended to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> anemic events and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_681'>septicemia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Besides its effect on hematological parameters, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002312" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">alpha-thalassemia</z:e> seems to have little impact on the prevalence of complications, as do beta(S)-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="5386">globin</z:chebi> haplotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Comparison with other series suggests that the natural history of SCA in Guadeloupe is more similar to that in Jamaica with regard to those reported in Europe and the United States, suggesting a potential impact of environmental factors on the clinical course of the disease </plain></SENT>
