<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of Digan oral liquid (DGOL) on cell proliferation cycle of thymic lymphocyte in immune mediated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (IMAA) in mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Balb/c mice were used in the experiment, after having exposed under a sublethal amount of radiation, the mice were received injection of mixed cells of thymus and lymph node of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi>/2 mice to form the IMAA models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The model mice were grouped and treated, then their thymus was taken to prepare the single cell suspension for analysis by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Majority of thymocyte of IMAA mice stopped at the G0/G1 phase, and the cells in S and G2 + M phases were significantly less than those in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control group, P &lt; 0.01 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both DGOL and Siwu oral liquid could increase the differentiation and proliferation of thymocytes and reduce the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> rate of them, but DGOL showed a better effect, P &lt; 0.05 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: DGOL could significantly promote the differentiation and proliferation of thymocytes and reduce the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> rate of them in IMAA mice, the effect of its is superior to that of Siwu oral liquid </plain></SENT>
