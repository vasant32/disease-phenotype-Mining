<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>FA has a very high incidence in the Afrikaner population of South Africa, possibly due to a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e> effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previously we observed allelic association between polymorphic markers flanking the FA group A gene (FANCA) and disease chromosomes in Afrikaners </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We genotyped 26 FA families with microsatellite and single nucleotide polymorphic markers and detected five FANCA haplotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mutation scanning of the FANCA gene revealed association of these haplotypes with four different mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most common was an intragenic deletion of exons 12-31, accounting for 60% of FA chromosomes in 46 unrelated Afrikaner FA patients, while two other mutations accounted for an additional 20% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Screening for these mutations in the European populations ancestral to the Afrikaners detected one patient from the Western Ruhr region of Germany who was heterozygous for the major deletion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mutation was associated with the same unique FANCA haplotype as in Afrikaner patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Genealogical investigation of 12 Afrikaner families with FA revealed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> were descended from a French Huguenot couple who arrived at the Cape on June 5, 1688, whereas mutation analysis showed that the carriers of the major mutation were descendants of this same couple </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The molecular and genealogical evidence is consistent with transmission of the major mutation to Western Germany and the Cape near the end of the 17th century, confirming the existence of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">founder</z:e> effect for FA in South Africa </plain></SENT>
