<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Five SAA patients received haploidentical allo-HSCT combined MSC infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSC</z:chebi> and MSC were collected from bone marrow or peripheral blood of haploidentical donors and umbilical cord blood respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After transplantation, the clinical hematopoietic reconstitution and early complications were monitored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results indicated that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the 5 patients achieved hematopoietic reconstitution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The average time for WBC count &gt; 2×10(9)/L was 13.8 days, and average time for Plt level &gt; 20×10(9)/L was 17.8 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The STR-PCR detection of patient peripheral blood at day 30 after transplantation showed that engraftment was complete donor's gene type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The communication with 1 patient was broken off because of his <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e>, other 4 patients are <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> alive in diseases-free state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the haploidentical allo-HSCT combined with umbilical cord MSC infusion is an effective approach to cure SAA, which needs to be further studied in a large number of cases </plain></SENT>
