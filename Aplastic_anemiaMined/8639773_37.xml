<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Clinical and laboratory studies have suggested involvement of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) in the pathophysiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>T cells from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) patients secrete IFN-gamma in vitro, activated cytotoxic lymphocytes infiltrate <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1368107" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aplastic bone marrow</z:e> (BM), and IFN-gamma <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, not detected in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> BM, is present in BM from most AA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Many patients respond to immunosuppressive therapy with antithymocyte globulin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using long-term BM cultures (LTBMC) as a tissue culture model of hematopoiesis, we show that IFN-gamma is a potent inhibitor in the long-term culture-initiating cell (LTC-IC) assay, the best in vitro surrogate test for human hematopoietic stem cells, as well as of the output of committed progenitor cells (colony-forming unit-granulocyte-macrophage [CFU-GM] and burst-forming unit-erythroid [BFU-E]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In LTBMC, continuous addition of relatively high IFN-gamma concentrations (1,000 U/mL weekly or 200 U/mL every 2 days) was required for inhibition of secondary colony formation, a measure of LTC-IC number and clonogenicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To mimick local production of IFN-gamma, human stromal cells were engineered by retroviral-mediated gene transfer to express a transduced IFN-gamma gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>IFN-gamma secreted by stromal cells was far more potent than exogenous IFN-gamma in its effects in the LTC-IC assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For purified CD34+ cells culture in the presence of IFN-gamma stroma dramatically reduced secondary colony numbers as well as production of CFU-GM and BFU-E </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Supernatants from these cultures contained only about 20 U/mL of IFN-gamma; this quantity of cytokine, when added to LTBMC, had little effect on hematopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mechanism of hematopoietic suppression was related to the inhibition of cell cycle progression and induction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of CD34+ cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no apparent effect of local low-level IFN-gamma production on stromal cell function, as reflected in cell <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, cell surface phenotype, or expression of hematopoietic growth factor genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>LTBMC with genetically altered stromal cells offers an in vitro model of immune suppression of hematopoiesis in AA and may be helpful in testing certain therapeutic modalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We infer from our data that local production of low levels of inhibitory cytokine is sufficient to markedly inhibit hematopoiesis and to destroy stem cells and more mature progenitor cells </plain></SENT>
