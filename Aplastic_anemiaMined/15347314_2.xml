<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi>-rHuMGDF was intravenously administered to healthy volunteers and patients with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, and AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The serum concentration of <z:chebi fb="77" ids="46793">PEG</z:chebi>-rHuMGDF was measured and the pharmacokinetics was investigated using non-linear mixed-effects modeling technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The systemic clearance (CL) and volume of distribution at steady-state (Vss) consistently decreased in the healthy subjects, when the dose increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients, CL and Vss decreased when the dose increased, but the change of CL was not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, no significant dose dependency of these parameter estimates was observed in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In AA patients there was no significant change in Vss but the CL of the higher dose groups was slightly smaller than that of the lower dose groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Relatively smaller CL and Vss in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> patients than those of healthy volunteers at the same dose were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This saturable pathway of CL may involve the receptor-mediated endocytosis and degradation by megakaryocyte lineage cells and platelets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The saturable distribution space can be also explained by the receptors on hematopoietic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The non-saturable distribution space corresponds to the value of plasma and interstitial fluid volume </plain></SENT>
