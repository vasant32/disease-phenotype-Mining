<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A more complex problem is immunosuppressed patients who have undergone bone marrow transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For a prolonged period, they are both neutropenic and thrombocytopenic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Survival in these patients is poor, and the role for extensive surgical intervention for sinus disease has to be weighed against the risk and the potential that this is a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0442893" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">systemic disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Between January 1983 and June 1993, 29 bone marrow transplant recipients with documented invasive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026946" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fungal infections</z:e> of the sinuses and paranasal tissues required surgical intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This represents 1.7% of the total 1692 bone marrow transplants performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were 22 allogeneic, 6 autologous, and 3 unrelated donor transplants, with two patients receiving two separate grafts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Underlying diseases included 24 hematologic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> and 5 other disorders, including 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and 1 solid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mortality rate from the initial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026946" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fungal infection</z:e> was 62% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Twenty-seven percent resolved the initial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> but subsequently died of other causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received medical management, such as amphotericin, rifampin, and colony-stimulating factors, in addition to surgical intervention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Surgical management ranged from minimally invasive procedures to extensive resections including medial maxillectomies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Sixty-one percent of the patients who died of the initial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> had undergone extensive surgical procedures versus 55% of those who resolved the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Recovery of neutrophil counts was required to clear the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> but did not necessarily predict a good outcome because 50% of those who died of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> had experienced neutrophil recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>White blood cell counts at the time of surgery were not significantly different between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Prognosis was poor when cranial and orbital involvement and/or bony <z:mpath ids='MPATH_580'>erosion</z:mpath> occurred </plain></SENT>
