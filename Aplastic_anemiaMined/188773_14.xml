<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Ten post-weanling 4-month-old cats, designated "tracers", were placed in a feline <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cluster household to determine the efficiency of horizontal transmission of feline <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> virus (FeLV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The tracer cats were confirmed as negative for prior exposure to FeLV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Following the placement in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cluster environment, the tracer cats were serologically monitored at intervals of 3-6 weeks for a total period of 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The tests employed included the detection of FeLV using fixed-cell immunofluorescence and the detection and titration of antibody to : (1) the feline oncornavirus-associated cell membrane antigen (FOCMA), as detected by membrane immunofluorescence; (2) viable FeLV, using serum neutralization; (3) virion core protein p30, using radioimmunoprecipitation; and (4) virion <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> gp70, using radioimmunoprecipitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the tracers had evidence of horizontal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> by FeLV, by several criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seven of the 10 had virus that could be isolated from plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of these 7 developed a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0679247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">terminal illness</z:e> within 18 months; 3 developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, 3 infectious <z:hpo ids='HP_0002586'>peritonitis</z:hpo>, and 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The remaining 3 were negative for FeLV by both virus isolation and fixed-cell immunofluorescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These 3 did, however, develop high antibody titers by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four criteria and they remained healthy throughout the examination period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results clearly indicate that unprotected pros-weanling cats brought into a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> exposure household environment have a high risk of becoming infected with FeLV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, a large proportion of the cats are at risk for development of persistent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042749" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">viremia</z:e> and FeLV-related diseases </plain></SENT>
