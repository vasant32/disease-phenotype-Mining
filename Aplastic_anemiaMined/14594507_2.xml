<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With modest to severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, one previously untreated patient and 13 patients who had failed immunosuppressive therapy were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients were expanded in vitro with a combination of cytokines and a calcium-mobilizing agents for 2 days, and the activated cells were infused intravenously once a week </plain></SENT>
