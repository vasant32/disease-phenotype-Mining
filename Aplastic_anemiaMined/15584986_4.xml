<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although young women who are D- occasionally receive unintentional transfusions with D+ red blood cells (RBCs), there are little data to assist with management of such an event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two cases of D- girls transfused with D+ RBCs are reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In an effort to prevent formation of anti-D, RBC exchange followed by administration of intravenous (IV) Rh immune globulin (RhIg) was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORTS: Patient 1, a 56-kg, 16-year-old D- girl, was involved in a motor vehicle crash </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>She received 4 units of Group O uncrossmatched D+ RBCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirty-six hours after admission, she underwent RBC exchange with 10 units of D- RBCs, followed by a total of 2718 microg of IV RhIg over 32 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Six months later, her antibody screen was negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patient 2, a 39-kg, 10-year-old D- girl with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, received 1 unit of D+ RBCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>She underwent RBC exchange on the same day with 5 units of D- RBCs, followed by a total of 900 microg of IV RhIg over 8 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Six months later her antibody screen was negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: RBC exchange followed by a calculated dose of IV RhIg was successful in preventing allo-immunization to D </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Several small studies suggest that both trauma and hematology patients may be less capable of becoming immunized with the transfusion of D+ blood components </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Until these findings are more clearly defined, there will be times when prevention of immunization of any D- girl is desired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>RBC exchange followed by RhIg appears to be one way to achieve this goal </plain></SENT>
