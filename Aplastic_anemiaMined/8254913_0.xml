<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>High signal intensity was detected in the bone marrow before BMT, but the bone marrow pattern of MRI became <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> after BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MRI seems to be effective for evaluating bone marrow cellularity and recovery, and for monitoring therapeutic effects in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> before and after treatment with BMT </plain></SENT>
