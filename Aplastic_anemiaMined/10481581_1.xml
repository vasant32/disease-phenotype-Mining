<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To detect and quantify by flow cytometry (FC) <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> clones in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024790" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PNH">paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>) and aplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> (AA) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We have performed a flow cytometric analysis to determine the granulocyte expression of CD55 and CD59 from 29 patients with AA and 11 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the 11 PNH patients the study showed 58 +/- 34% and 56 +/- 32% (mean +/- SD) CD55(-) y CD59(-) granulocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A good correlation was found between the results of FC and haemolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The follow-up study showed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> clone progression in one case and stability in 5 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among 11 AA patients studied at diagnosis, two presented a population of CD55(-) granulocytes (14% and 48%) with CD59 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, this defect disappeared in both patients after immunosuppressive therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The FC study revealed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> clones in 7 cases among the 26 analyzed after treatment (23 with ATG and/or CyA), in 3 cases with negative Ham's test (in two this became positive 6 and 12 months later) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean values obtained in these 7 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>-AA syndrome were 26 +/- 15% y 36 +/- 30% (mean +/- SD) CD55(-) and CD59(-) granulocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median time from diagnosis to detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> phenomenon was 83 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the follow-up study, 4 cases had stability, one case had a decrease and one a progression of the abnormal clone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In a retrospective analysis, among the 7 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>-AA syndrome, 5 had a partial response after the initial treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The FC on granulocytes is a useful method to diagnose and characterize <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This test is good for early detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> clones in AA patients at initial diagnosis and in long term survivors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In both diseases it permits measuring the extent of the abnormal clone and its follow up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The extent of the defect is more related to haemolysis than the haematopoietic deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> development seems to be more frequent in AA patients with incomplete response after immunosuppressive therapy and in some cases the defect could be latent at the time of diagnosis </plain></SENT>
