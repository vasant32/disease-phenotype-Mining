<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The seven-step procedure, which included ion exchange chromatography, <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> precipitation, gel filtration, and adsorption chromatography, yielded a preparation with a potency of 70,400 units/mg of protein in 21% yield </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This represents a purification factor of 930 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purified hormone has a single electrophoretic component in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53656">polyacrylamide</z:chebi> gels at pH 9, in the presence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8984">sodium dodecylsulfate</z:chebi> at pH 7, and in the presence of <z:chebi fb="60" ids="29234">Triton</z:chebi> X-100 at pH 6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two fractions of the same potency and molecular size, by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8984">sodium dodecyl sulfate</z:chebi> gel electrophoresis, but differing slightly in mobility at pH 9, were obtained at the last step of fractionation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The nature of the difference between these two components is not yet understood </plain></SENT>
