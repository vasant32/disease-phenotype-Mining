<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">Benzene</z:chebi> and the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="36141">quinones</z:chebi> were shown to inhibit <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> synthesis in a dose-dependent manner at concentrations which had no significant effect on lymphocyte viability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, 5 microM PBQ, the putative toxic metabolite of <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi>, was shown to inhibit the formation of the T-cell growth factor IL-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that inhibition of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> synthesis in lymphocytes by <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> may prevent the production of factors required for hemopoiesis and thus contribute to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> caused by <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
