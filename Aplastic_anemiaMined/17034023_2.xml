<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using a case-control design, we compared the frequency of this polymorphism in 91 patients with acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> to 132 ethnically matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Representation of the PTPN22 variant was not significantly different between the two populations, suggesting that this gene polymorphism does not contribute to the etiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>Aplastic anemia</z:hpo> thus joins a list of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> that commonly lack a major humoral disease component and do not associate with the PTPN22 variant </plain></SENT>
