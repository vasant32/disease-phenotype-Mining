<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine if high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> is an effective therapy for children with refractory severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (SAA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: SAA is an illness characterized by the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of hematopoietic precursors associated with life-threatening complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) is the treatment of choice if a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-related donor is available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunosuppression with anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> A (CSA) is an option for patients who are not HSCT candidates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Unrelated donor HSCT has been used with limited success </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>High-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> has been used successfully in the treatment of adults with SAA, but experience in children is limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PROCEDURE: Five pediatric patients who had failed previous immunosuppressive therapy for SAA were treated with high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (45 mg/kg/day x 4 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After 12 months of treatment, two of five patients experienced a complete response with high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The two complete responders achieved red cell recovery with a hematocrit of &gt;36% at days 212 and 112 and platelet recovery with a platelet count of &gt;100 x 10(9)/L at days 126 and 324 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Of the remaining patients, one patient failed to respond, and two patients expired from infectious complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: High-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> can lead to complete responses in children with SAA who have failed to respond to traditional immunosuppressive therapy </plain></SENT>
