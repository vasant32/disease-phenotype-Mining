<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We previously found plasma levels of CD40 ligand (CD40L), chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 5 (CXCL5), chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 5 (CCL5) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) to be low in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) patients and to be correlated with platelet count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To study the association of CD40L, CXCL5, CCL5 and EGF with platelets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We measured cytokines in the plasma of immune thrombocytopenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000979'>purpura</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi>) and AA patients using the Luminex assay and confirmed the results in a mouse model and in vitro experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> and AA showed similarly low levels of CD40L, CXCL5, CCL5 and EGF, compared with healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi>, levels of these proteins were significantly greater in patients with higher platelet counts than in those with lower platelet counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a murine <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> model, levels of CD40L, CXCL5, CCL5 and EGF decreased with platelet count after immune-mediated destruction, while the cytokine levels increased when the platelet count recovered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In vitro, concentrations of these cytokines in the supernatants of platelet suspensions were proportional to platelet numbers, and levels in sera prepared by simple blood coagulation were equivalent to those in platelet-rich plasma-converted sera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression for CXCL5, CCL5 and EGF was higher in platelets than in megakaryocytes, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, granulocytes and non-megakaryocytic bone marrow cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Plasma CD40L, CXCL5, CCL5 and EGF are mainly platelet-derived, suggesting a role of platelets in immune responses and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Measurement of CD40L, CXCL5, CCL5 and EGF in human blood allowed testable inferences concerning <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp> and pathophysiology in quantitative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005818" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">platelet disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
