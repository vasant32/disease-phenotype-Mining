<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have recently shown that in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) recovering following immunosuppressive therapy, the persistent reduction in the bone marrow clonogenic potential is unrelated to suppressive effects of the myeloid stroma and intrinsic to the hematopoietic progenitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the mechanisms of this defect by determining the response of the aplastic CD34+ clonogenic precursors to proliferative signals induced by hematopoietic growth factors and comparing their results with those of a control population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Light density bone marrow mononuclear cells were lymphocyte and monocyte depleted and enhanced for the CD34+ progenitors by immunomagnetic selection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Selected progenitors were then cultured in the mixed colony assay with incremental concentrations of combinations containing erythropoietin (Epo), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin-3 (IL-3) and c-kit ligand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow from aplastic patients had significantly fewer light density cells displaying the CD34 antigen (mean 0.65%, SD 0.35 vs. 1.62%, SD 1.4; p=0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Dose response studies on aplastic CD34+ cells demonstrated that at low concentrations of Epo, IL-3 and GM-CSF, clonogenic growth was significantly impaired but achieved <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values at concentrations giving plateau growth in control cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> colony types, responses to effective concentrations of c-kit ligand corresponded with those of controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data suggest abnormalities at the receptor or signal transduction levels </plain></SENT>
