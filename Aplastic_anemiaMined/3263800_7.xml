<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Interleukin-1 (IL-1), a monocyte factor, plays a central role in the regulation of the immune response; recent data have suggested that IL-1 is the same molecule as hemopoietin-1, a growth factor acting on the multipotent hematopoietic stem cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>IL-1 affects hematopoiesis (1) in vitro, by inducing the release of colony-stimulating factors and regulating early hematopoietic progenitor cells, and (2) in vivo, by stimulating stem cell recovery in irradiated or chemotherapy-treated mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Several lines of evidence suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> may be mediated by cells of the immune system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We address the issue of abnormal IL-1 production in severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and attempt to correlate normalization of the levels with response to anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied IL-1 production by monocytes from 21 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> using a bioassay for IL-1 activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients were evaluated before ATG therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eight patients were studied before and three months after ATG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, five patients were evaluated only after ATG treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One patient did not respond to ATG but did respond to intravenous <z:chebi fb="4" ids="2453">acyclovir</z:chebi>, and was studied before and after <z:chebi fb="4" ids="2453">acyclovir</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients with other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521860" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic disorders</z:e> requiring transfusions and 30 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> healthy volunteers were also assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: IL-1 production was markedly decreased in 75 percent of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> when compared with that in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control subjects (p less than 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Hematologic recovery correlated with normalization of IL-1 production in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but two cases (p less than 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These observations represent the first evidence of monocyte dysfunction and deficient hematopoietic growth factor production in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Decreased IL-1 production may have a pathologic role in some cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
