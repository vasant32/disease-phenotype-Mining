<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In this study, we reported the outcomes of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) as a treatment modality for pediatric patients admitted over the past 20 years in a single institute </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>From January 1989 to January 2007, 26 patients with a median age of 8 years underwent 14 matched sibling donor (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MSD</z:e>) and 12 alternative donor (AD) transplantations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two patients received second transplantation successfully after primary graft failure and late graft rejection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two patients who received transplantation from matched unrelated donors (MUD) died of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo>, and one of them also had a graft failure at <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The overall 5-year survival rate was 92.1%: 83.3% for AD transplantation and 100% for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MSD</z:e> transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Grade II <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft versus host disease</z:e> (GVHD) developed in 3 patients, and extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD developed in 2 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An interval of more than 6 months from diagnosis to transplantation was the major poor prognostic factor for our patients' survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, in our experience, HSCT from a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MSD</z:e> remains the first choice of treatment for pediatric patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For patients without <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MSD</z:e>, transplantation from an AD can also result in long-term survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Earlier transplantation after diagnosis can also result in better outcomes </plain></SENT>
