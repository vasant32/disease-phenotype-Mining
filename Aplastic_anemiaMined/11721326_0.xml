<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On day 0, Ham and Sucrosa tests were positive and hematological parameters were altered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Low <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (Hb) levels and erythrocyte and leukocyte counts were found and continued decreasing on days 7 and 24 (last day of study) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>High LDH levels, indirect <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> and reticulocyte counts were detected throughout </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We evaluated CD55 and CD59 on erythrocytes by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results showed low CD55 expression with respect to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Since day 0, CD59 staining detected two red cell populations: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> I (48%), cells with positive fluorescence similar to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> III (52%), negative cells (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> clone) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These negative cells increased, reaching 70% on day 24 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Other membrane anchored leukocyte proteins were also absent (CD14) or decreased (CD16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We found a good correlation between clinical observations, evolution of the laboratory values and expansion of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> clone </plain></SENT>
