<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent experimental evidence has confirmed that T2 has potent anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive activity, and a United States Food and Drug Administration-approved clinical trial is currently exploring the efficacy of T2 in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Despite the potential therapeutic benefits of T2, there is ample documentation that T2 is toxic, targeting, among other things, the hematopoietic system, and its use has resulted in cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001882'>leukopenia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This investigation was undertaken to characterize the in vitro effects of T2 on primary human CD34-positive (CD34+) bone marrow cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrate that T2 has a potent inhibitory effect on the clonogenic response of human bone marrow cells to exogenously added hematopoietic growth factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The inhibition of colony formation by T2 is not the result of direct cytotoxicity or <z:mp ids='MP_0006042'>increased apoptosis</z:mp> and indicates a functional suppression of hematopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additional experiments demonstrate that T2 also alters transcriptional regulation in bone marrow cells by inhibiting nuclear factor-kappaB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This transcription factor is found in CD34+ bone marrow cells and has been recently shown to be a requirement for colony formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that therapeutic concentrations of T2 exert a significant hematotoxic effect by inhibiting growth factor response in CD34+ bone marrow cells and suggest that inhibition of nuclear factor-kappaB may play a role in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">blood dyscrasias</z:e> encountered with the use of this drug </plain></SENT>
