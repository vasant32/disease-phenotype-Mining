<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are more than 230,000 available units today </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The ideal UCB graft is a unit that is matched in five or six of six HLA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A, B (low-resolution) and DRB1 (high-resolution) alleles and which has over 2.5 x 107 nucleated cells/kg body weight (BW) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four of six matched units are also used specially if the cell dose gives more than 3 x 10(7) nucleated cells/kg BW </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our unrelated donor UCB transplant program was started in 1996 searching international cord blood banks (Netcord, New York) for patients with a definitive or potential indication for stem cell transplantation who lacked a matched family donor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 1995 to 1996, a search was initiated for 87 patients with malignant (n = 56, 37 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo>) and nonmalignant conditions (16 congenital diseases, 14 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patient data along with low-resolution A, B, and DR typing were sent to the New York Blood Center, along with a blood sample for high-resolution DRB1 typing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Parallel searches were done in the Netcord database among UCB units with reported high-resolution DRB1 typing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Forty-eight searches were done between 1995 and 2000 (31 with high resolution) and 39 were done between 2000 and 2005 (33 with high resolution) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>UCB units were considered adequate if they had more than 2.7 x 10(7) cells/kg BW </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the first period, four patients (13%) matched five of six high-resolution unit and 21 (67%) a four of six match </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>During the second period, 15 patients (46%) found a five of six match and 16 (48%) a four of six match (P = .012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Nearly half of our patients find an optimal matched UCB unit for transplantation in international banks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The creation of a local UCB bank in our country is supported by these data </plain></SENT>
