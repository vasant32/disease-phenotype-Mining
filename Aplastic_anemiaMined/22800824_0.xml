<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Immunoregulatory cytokine polymorphisms can directly regulate the expression levels of cytokines, which play a crucial role in many diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to study cytokine gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and the correlated cytokine expression levels in relationship to the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Peripheral blood samples were collected from 30 PNH patients and 40 healthy donors; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the samples were collected from the Han people of Northern China </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eight SNP loci in five cytokine genes, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha (TNF-α), interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and IL-10, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>TNF-a, TGF-b, IFN-g, IL-6, and IL-10 were analyzed by sequence-specific primer polymerase chain reaction (PCR-SSP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The plasma protein levels of TNF-a, TGF-b, and IFN-g were assessed by an ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> patients had a lower frequency of the TC/GG genotype of the TGF-b gene (P &lt; 0.01) and a higher frequency of the C allele in the TGF-b gene (+10) compared to the controls (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The predominant genotype of the +874 locus of the IFN-g gene was TA in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> patients, while that in the predominant genotype was AA in the control group and was statistically significant (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The frequency of the T allele in the IFN-g gene was dramatically higher in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> patients than in the controls (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> patients had a reduced frequency of the GC and CC genotypes, as well as the C allele at locus -174 of the IL-6 gene compared to the controls (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In addition, the plasma concentrations of TNF-a, TGF-b, and IFN-g were significantly higher in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> group compared to the control group (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Expression levels of the TNF-a, TGF-b, and IFN-g cytokines play an important role in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The GC and CC genotypes, as well as the C allele of the IL-6 gene may protect the Han people of Northern China against <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the TC/GG genotype of the TGF-b gene may be the protective allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the TA genotype and the T allele for the IFN-g gene, as well as the C allele of TGF-b may be susceptible to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>However, SNPs in the TNF-a and IL-10 genes did not correlate with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, the increased plasma concentrations of TNF-a, TGF-b, and IFN-g in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> patients may also be related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> development </plain></SENT>
