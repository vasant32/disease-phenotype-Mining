<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To determine the effect of recombinant human granulocyte-colony stimulation factor (rhG-CSF) on the immune system, serum immunoglobulins, lymphocyte subsets, and serum cytokines were analyzed in eight pediatric patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) during 8-week rhG-CSF therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The rhG-CSF was administered either subcutaneously (200 micrograms/m2 x 4 weeks, followed by 400 micrograms/m2 x 4 weeks) or intravenously (400 micrograms/m2 x 4 weeks, followed by 800 micrograms/m2 x 4 weeks) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In response to rhG-CSF therapy, neutrophil counts exceeded the pretreatment counts by twofold during the first week except for one case that did not attain twofold increase until day 41 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>While serum IgG and IgA were not affected, serum IgM was elevated during treatment in six of the eight cases to more than 1.2-fold basal levels (P &lt; 0.04); however, there was no increase in serum interleukin (IL)-6 and interferon-gamma levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, CD56 positive NK cells significantly dropped from 7.7% to 4.5% (P &lt; 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that systemic administration of rhG-CSF affects not only the neutrophil count, but also serum IgM levels and the natural killer cell population in patients with AA </plain></SENT>
