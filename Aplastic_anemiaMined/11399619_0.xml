<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have shown that the levels of hematopoietic progenitor cells (colony-forming cells; CFC) are drastically reduced in the vast majority of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This has been observed both in patients before and after immunosuppressive therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In those studies, however, both groups of patients were usually formed by different individuals, thus it was not possible to follow the kinetics of such cells in each particular patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we have determined the content of myeloid and erythroid CFC in individual AA patients before and after therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treated patients were studied at two different times (8-18 months apart) to detect any possible variations due to the ongoing treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At diagnosis, the levels of both myeloid and erythroid CFC were drastically reduced, as compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This correlated with very low levels of leukocytes and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> in circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After the patients entered an immunosuppressive treatment, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of them showed significant increments in their CFC levels, and this correlated with increments in their hematological parameters in peripheral blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, in most patients CFC levels were still below the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When the second sample after treatment was obtained, great variations in CFC numbers were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In terms of erythroid CFC levels, a further increase was seen in most patients, and this correlated with a further increase in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In contrasts, the levels of myeloid CFC were increased in only some of the patients, whereas in others, significant reductions were evident </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, in this latter group of patients, CFC never reached the levels observed before treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that, in a significant proportion of patients, a common pattern seems to exist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>That is to say, low CFC numbers are present before treatment; an increase in the numbers of such cells results as an effect of the immunosuppressive therapy and further variations in CFC numbers (within individual limits that may differ significantly from one patient to another) take place as long as the treatment continues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Finally, we observed a correlation between CFC levels and the clinical status of the patients, i.e., those patients that showed a complete or a partial response to treatment showed higher levels of both myeloid and erythroid CFC than those patients that did not respond to therapy </plain></SENT>
