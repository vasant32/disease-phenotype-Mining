<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Alterations in fat metabolism with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096458" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">vascular occlusion</z:e> due to fat embolization, as well as microtraumata and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000939'>osteoporosis</z:hpo> are discussed as etiologic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast, <z:hpo ids='HP_0010885'>aseptic bone necrosis</z:hpo> in relation to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> treatment is rare in children and adolescents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We therefore report 3 patients, aged from 10 to 18 years, suffering from severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, meningeal relapse after <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelocytic leukemia</z:hpo> respectively, who developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0010885'>aseptic bone necrosis</z:hpo> 6, 11, and 20 months following the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of corticoid therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients survive from 28+ to 50+ months after diagnosis of their initial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic disease</z:e>, as it can be expected today for increasing numbers of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We therefore believe, that <z:hpo ids='HP_0010885'>aseptic bone necrosis</z:hpo> may represent a serious therapy related complication and suggest that, diagnostic examination in patients with suspicious complaints of the hip, shoulder or knee should also exclude the possibility of a bone <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> after leucemic relapse has been ruled out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Since radiological changes only develop several weeks to months after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the clinical symptoms and because of the disabling consequences for patients, misdiagnosed at the beginning, a 99 technetium bone scan should be done as early as possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">Corticosteroids</z:chebi>, despite their serious side effects are still being considered as a important part of hematologic therapy and are not being omitted in the near future, so that the earliest possible diagnosis of bone <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> will remain of great importance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
