<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Two groups of SAA patients were enrolled in the present study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One was a treatment group including 21 patients being treated with anti-CD(4), CD(8) monoclonal antibodies as well as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Another was a control group including 20 patients being treated with anti-lymphocyte globulin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The response rates in the two groups were more or less some, being 76.2% for the treatment group and 65.0% for the control group (P &gt; 0.05), but the blood routine examination results showed quicker recovery in the treatment group than in the control group (P &lt; 0.05) and the incidences of side effects related to therapy such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> were less in the treatment group than in the control group (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The combination of anti-CD(4), CD(8) monoclonal antibodies and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> A is safe and efficient in treating SAA </plain></SENT>
