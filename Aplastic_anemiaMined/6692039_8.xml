<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Two in vitro tests were applied to 54 consecutive patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> who were treated in Seattle with antithymocyte globulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the first test, peripheral blood mononuclear cells were collected from each patient before antithymocyte globulin therapy and then treated with a panel of monoclonal antibodies and complement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The treated peripheral blood mononuclear cells were assayed for erythroid burst-forming units (BFU-E) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This test was designed to determine whether removing various subpopulations of peripheral blood mononuclear cells would increase the number of detectable BFU-E </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the second test, peripheral blood was collected within 48 hr after completion of antithymocyte globulin therapy, and cells were immediately assayed for BFU-E without any further treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Data from both tests were analyzed to determine whether the in vitro results correlated with patient response to therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Binary logistic regression analyses indicate that a modest correlation (p = 0.04) exists between test 1 in vitro results and patient response to therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the strength of this association appears to decrease as the interval between diagnosis and treatment increases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, test 2 had a very significant correlation (p = 0.001) with response to therapy among patients diagnosed more than 1 mo prior to treatment, whereas such an association was not apparent among patients treated within 1 mo of diagnosis </plain></SENT>
