<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In the animal kingdom, even herbivorous animals swallow the placenta after the birth of the baby (for example, the cow) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the human system, we do not know about the proper utilization of the placenta and membranes although there are suggestions regarding this on the basis of research on placental umbilical cord blood stem cells as an alternative to bone marrow transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this present series of placental umbilical cord whole blood transfusions, we wanted to examine the safety aspect of other components of cord blood transfusion, e.g., fetal RBC, growth factors and cytokine filled plasma, etc., in different indications of blood transfusion, from the pediatric to the geriatric age group, in malignant and non-malignant disorders affecting our patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred and seventy-four units of umbilical cord whole blood were collected aseptically from the umbilical vein after caesarean section in standard pediatric blood transfusion bags, after the removal of the baby from the operative field and after confirming the stable condition of the mother </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The volume of cord blood varied from 50 ml to 140 ml with a mean of 86 ml+/-16 ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS AND ANALYSIS: The cord blood was transfused immediately (within three days of collection) to 62 patients from nine years to 78 years of age, of whom 32 were suffering from varying stages and grades of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> from 1 April 1999 till date i.e., 11 Aug 2000, after obtaining adequate consent and following the precautions of standard blood transfusion protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The remaining 30 patients included patients suffering from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002875" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thalassemia major</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>chronic renal failure</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0038013" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ankylosing spondylitis</z:e> and a geriatric group of patients with benign prostatic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> have tolerated the procedure without any immunological or non-immunological reactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: On the basis of our experience with 174 units of placental umbilical cord whole blood transfusion in malignant and non-malignant conditions (within three days of collection and preservation at 1-6 degrees C in a refrigerator), we are of the opinion that this is a safe transfusion protocol which takes advantage of the safety of nature's finest biological sieve, i.e., the placenta, as an alternative to adult whole blood transfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It also has the advantage of a higher oxygen carrying capacity of fetal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> in addition to many growth factors and other cytokine filled cord blood plasma along with its hypoantigenicity </plain></SENT>
