<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>For children with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (SAA) who fail immunosuppressive therapy and lack a human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-matched sibling donor, unrelated donors provide a source of hematopoietic stem cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Data from 195 children with acquired SAA who underwent unrelated donor transplantation between 1989 and 2003 were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neutrophil recovery (86% at day-28) was higher with total body irradiation-containing conditioning regimen and in younger recipients (aged &lt; or =16 years) receiving grafts from older donors (aged &gt;40 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recovery was lower after mismatched transplants and transplantations prior to 1997 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mortality rates were higher after mismatched transplants, in recipients with a poor performance score, and when the interval between diagnosis and transplantation was longer than 4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When restricted to donor-recipient pairs with allele-level HLA typing (8-loci; n = 118), mortality rates were also higher after mismatched transplants and older recipients receiving grafts from older donors; 5-year probabilities of overall survival after HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1 matched and mismatched transplants adjusted for donor and recipient age were 57% and 39%, respectively (P = 0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The data suggest that unrelated donor transplantation is an acceptable alternative for children; early referral for transplantation and identification of an HLA-matched (allele-level) donor offers the best outcome </plain></SENT>
