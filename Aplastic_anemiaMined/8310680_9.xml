<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948201" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">alloimmunization</z:e> both by serological demonstration of HLA antibodies and by clinical demonstration of platelet refractoriness in 50 multitransfused children who exclusively received filtered, leukocyte-free blood products </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The basic diagnoses included <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0279068" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">pediatric solid tumors</z:e>, and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also present a reference group of 10 similarly multitransfused children, who either deliberately or inadvertently had received nonfiltered blood products on some occasions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the study group of 50 children, none developed platelet refractoriness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median corrected increment was 11.1 x 10(9)/l at the time of initial diagnosis, and 10.4 at the time of the study 8 months later (median) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>None had detectable HLA antibodies in serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, in the reference group 3/10 had HLA antibodies in serum, and 1/10 was clearly refractory to random pooled platelets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that systematic use of leukocyte-free blood components effectively prevents <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948201" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">alloimmunization</z:e> in heavily transfused children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Leukocyte <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> to the level of &lt; 1 x 10(6) of contaminating leukocytes per unit is sufficient and seems to prevent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948201" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">alloimmunization</z:e> totally </plain></SENT>
