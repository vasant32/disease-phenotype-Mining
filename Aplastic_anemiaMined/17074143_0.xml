<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty-three patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematological diseases</z:e> with HLA-matched (65%) or mismatched (35%) unrelated donors were receiving UPBSCT (n = 33) or UBMT (n = 30) between May 2001 and June 2005 in our institute </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> received standard conditioning regimens with Bu/Cy (n = 53) or TBI/Cy (n = 10) with the addition of ATG for 3 - 4 days (n = 58) or CD3 antibody (n = 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were more patients receiving rabbit ATG in the UPBSCT group than UBMT (21/33 vs 8/25, P = 0.02) and the remaining patients received pig ATG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">Graft versus host disease</z:e> (GVHD) prophylaxis consisting of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="168396">mycophenolate</z:chebi> mofetil were the same </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The two groups were matched for the following factors: gender, diagnosis, HLA-compatibility and conditioning regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median age in the UPBSCT group was 29.5 (10 - 47) years and in the UBMT 21.5 (7 - 42) years (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The UPBSCT group consisted of 10 females and 23 males and the UBMT group 7 females and 23 males </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients in the UPBSCT and 8 patients in the UBMT group were diagnosed with as <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>); 9 and 12 as <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>); 11 and 10 as <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphatic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL); 2 and 0 as severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (SAA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were more patients in aggressive stage (&gt;CR1) in the UBMT group than in the UPBSCT group (9/30 vs 3/33, P = 0.06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Median follow-up was 12 months after UPBSCT and 20 months after UBMT (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>UPBSCT group had a higher number of infused MNC as comparison with UBMT group (6.16 x 10(8)/kg vs 2.80 x 10(8)/kg, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Both neutrophil and platelet recovery were faster after UPBSCT (11 days vs 17 days, 14 days vs 27.5 days, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Although the cumulative incidence of grades II - IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD and severe aGVHD in the UPBSCT group were less than in the UBMT group (33.04% vs 66.69%, 7.26% vs 34.52%, P &lt; 0.05), there was no difference after the source of ATG was counted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD did not differ between the two groups (18/25 vs 14/22) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Relapse including molecular relapse occurred in 6 of the 31 patients after UPBSCT and in 4 of the 30 patients after UBMT (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Finally, fifteen of the 30 patients died after UBMT, as compared with 8 of the 33 patients after UPBSCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The cumulative overall survival was 62.45% after UPBSCT and 47.22% after UBMT (P = 0.114) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that UPBSCT led to significantly faster leukocyte and platelet engraftment without increasing the incidence of aGVHD and the overall survival was comparable between the two methods of therapy </plain></SENT>
