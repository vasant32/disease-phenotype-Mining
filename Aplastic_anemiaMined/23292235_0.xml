<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Overall, the primary objective of a stable haploidentical hematopoietic engraftment with a low rate of GVHD is unmet in a significant proportion of patients undergoing haplo-SCT for SAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Haploidentical transplants for refractory SAA should be performed in a specialist center with major experience in hematopoietic SCT procedures and preferably performed within the framework of a local clinical protocol designed specifically to address the prevention of graft rejection and GVHD </plain></SENT>
