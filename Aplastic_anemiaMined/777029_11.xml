<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although lymphocyte dysfunction has been observed in a few such patients, no systematic study of neutrophil function has yet been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neutrophil chemotaxis was evaluated by a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50076">51Cr</z:chebi>-radioassay after bone marrow transplantation in 34 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The response to a chemotactic stimulus (C5a) was severely depressed (less than 35% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>) in 18 patients, moderately depressed (35-65% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>) in an additional 6, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in 10 subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean response in the absence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft vs. host disease</z:e> and antithymocyte globulin administration was 73.3+/-9.2% (SE) in contrast to 29.7+/-9.6% (P is less than 0.01) in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft vs. host disease</z:e> treated with antithymocyte golbulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft vs. host disease</z:e> and antithymocyte globulin were implicated since the presence of either factor alone was associated with depressed chemotaxis (31.1+/-4.9% for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft vs. host disease</z:e>, P is less than 0.01; 17.0+/-7.8% for antithymocyte globulin, P is less than 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> neutrophils were incubated with antithymocyte globulin in vitro, their chemotactic response was markedly suppressed in the absence of a cytotoxic effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Transplant patients with defective chemotaxis experienced significantly more <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> than those with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> chemotaxis, and analysis of specific etiologic agents showed that this was predominantly related to <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> pathogens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Chemotactic inhibitors were detected in the sera of seven patients and elevated IgE levels were found in nine subjects, eight of whom had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft vs. host disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Generation of chemotactic activity by endotoxin activation of serum was reduced in five patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results demonstrate a severe defect in neutrophil chemotaxis in some bone marrow transplant patients and suggest that <z:mp ids='MP_0002463'>neutrophil dysfunction</z:mp> may predispose to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> in such patients </plain></SENT>
