<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A case of a 64-year-old Japanese woman who developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001973'>idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura</z:hpo> with antibody to platelet <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> IIb/IIIa 4 years following a resection of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0100522'>thymoma</z:hpo> is reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow was hypocellular and ferrokinetics revealed the prolongation of the half-time of plasma iron disappearance and a decrease in red cell utilization, findings compatible with a diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The life span of platelets was markedly decreased to 3.07 h, and the test for antiplatelet <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> IIb/IIIa antibody was positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient's serum had a suppressive effect on the formation of colonies of burst-forming unit-erythroid and colony-forming unit-granulocyte using <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> in this patient may have been induced by some suppressive activity in the serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Splenectomy followed by an administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> effectively restored the peripheral blood count </plain></SENT>
