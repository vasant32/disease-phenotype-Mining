<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to determine whether specific pretransplantation clinical and laboratory characteristics can be used to distinguish between patients with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30480">FHF</z:chebi> who are at higher risk of developing AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed a retrospective case-control study to evaluate the clinical and laboratory characteristics of those patients who presented with evidence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30480">FHF</z:chebi> and eventually developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We identified nine patients with AA, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had the indeterminate form of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30480">FHF</z:chebi> and underwent liver transplantation (LTx) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The AA patients were compared with a control group of 47 patients with indeterminate <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30480">FHF</z:chebi> that underwent transplantation and did not develop AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found that males were over-represented in the group of patients that developed AA (p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, during the pretransplant period, the AA group had a significantly lower white count (p = 0.005), absolute lymphocyte count (p = 0.004), and platelet count (p = 0.019) when compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that evidence of early bone marrow dysfunction is apparent before liver transplantation and the development of AA in a subset of patients with the indeterminate form of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30480">FHF </z:chebi></plain></SENT>
