<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Studies of human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic diseases</z:e> and gene-targeted animal models have provided evidence that functional decline of telomeres and deregulation of cell cycle checkpoints contribute to the aging process of tissue stem cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Telomere dysfunction can induce DNA damage response via key cell cycle checkpoints, leading to cellular senescence or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> depending on the tissue type and developmental stage of a specific stem cell compartment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Telomerase mutation and telomere shortening have been observed in a variety of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0947743,C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematological disorders</z:e>, such as <z:mp ids='MP_0009563'>dyskeratosis</z:mp> congenital, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, in which the hematopoietic stem cells (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSC</z:chebi>) are a major target during the pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, telomere dysfunction is able to induce both cell-intrinsic checkpoints and environmental factors limiting the self-renewal capacity and differentiation potential of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSCs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Crucial components in the cascade of DNA damage response, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001009'>telangiectasia</z:hpo> mutated, CHK2, p53, p21 and p16/p19(ARF), play important roles in <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSC</z:chebi> maintenance and self-renewal in the scenarios of both sufficient telomere reserve and dysfunctional telomere </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, a further understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSC</z:chebi> aging may help identity new therapeutic targets for stem cell-based regenerative medicine </plain></SENT>
