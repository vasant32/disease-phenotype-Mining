<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that in many instances <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> is an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> rather than a primary failure of the hemopoietic stem cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> allogeneic marrow grafts still pose enormous problems and only one of our 12 grafts has become a longterm survivor </plain></SENT>
