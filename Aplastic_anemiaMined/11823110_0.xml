<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, its use has been restricted because of association with occurrence of rare cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001399'>hepatic failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since it was shown that FBM metabolism requires <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> (GSH), we used two experimental protocols to determine if the effects of specific metabolites were sensitive to redox pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>FBM and its metabolite W873 (2-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="30396">phenyl</z:chebi>-1,3-propanediol monocarbamate), at 0.1 mg/ml, induced <z:mp ids='MP_0006042'>increased apoptosis</z:mp> of bone marrow cells from B10.<z:chebi fb="3" ids="31255">AKM</z:chebi> mice as compared with B10.BR mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Study of the effects of the drug on human promonocytic cell line U937 cells showed that FBM and the metabolite W2986 [2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-1,3 propanediol dicarbamate], at higher concentrations (0.5 mg/ml), induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in this cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also observed that while FBM and its metabolites induced <z:mp ids='MP_0006042'>increased apoptosis</z:mp> of B cells with reduced intracellular GSH levels, addition of exogenous GSH <z:mp ids='MP_0006043'>decreased apoptosis</z:mp> induced by W873 but did not significantly affect <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> induced by FBM or W2986 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that, at concentrations used during the present investigations, FBM metabolites induce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> via redox-sensitive and redox-independent pathways </plain></SENT>
