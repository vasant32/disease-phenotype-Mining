<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Nonmyeloablative pretreatment was given to 42 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematological diseases</z:e>, 26 males and 16 females with the median age of 37, that were matched with the donors in terms of HLA, such as CD3 monoclonal antibody, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> A, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="3498">CTX</z:chebi>) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> among which 6 were given fludarabine in addition, and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="3498">CTX</z:chebi> and antilymphocyte globulin for patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_512'>myeloproliferative disease</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, thus practicing nonmyeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplantation (NAST) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) and survival were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Donor-recipient hematopoietic cell chimerism was formed in 42 patients, with 18 cases of full donor chimerism (<z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDC</z:chebi>) and 24 cases of mixed chimerism (MC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the 42 patients, 10 (23.8%) developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD (aGVHD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The incidence of aGVHD in group MC (2/24, 8.9%) was significantly lower than that in group <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDC</z:chebi> (8/24, 44.4%, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, eight (19.1%) developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD (cGVHD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The incidence of cGVHD was also lower in group MC (4/24, 16.7%) in comparison with 4/18 (23.2%) in group <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDC</z:chebi> (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in recovery time of neutrophils and platelets (P &gt; 0.05) between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thirty-one patients still survived and there was no significant difference between the group <z:chebi fb="17" ids="38848">FDC</z:chebi> and MC in terms of survival rate and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> relapse rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Compared with full donor chimerism, mixed chimerism significantly alleviates the incidence of aGVHD and does not delay the hematopoietic reconstitution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It may be an ideal model of engraftment that mixed chimerism converts to full donor chimerism within several months after NAST </plain></SENT>
