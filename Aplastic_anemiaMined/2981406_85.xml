<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied the mechanism of hematopoietic suppression in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> by means of two-color flow microfluorometric analysis of lymphocyte subpopulations and correlated the results with the occurrence in vitro of hematopoietic suppression and interferon production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 12 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> a striking increase was observed in a population of "activated" suppressor T lymphocytes, which were defined by binding of both anti-Leu-2 and anti-HLA-DR monoclonal antibodies (patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, 6.8 +/- 3.2 per cent [mean +/- S.D.]; <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects, 1.7 +/- 1.3; patients given multiple transfusions, 2.5 +/- 1.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Tac antigen expression, another surface marker of lymphocyte activation, was increased on suppressor lymphocytes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> five patients examined (patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, 31 +/- 17 per cent; <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects, 0.7 +/- 0.24; patients given multiple transfusions, 2.3 +/- 1.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When Tac+ and Tac- cells were separated in a cell sorter, only Tac+ cells produced interferon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When lymphocytes of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> were cocultured with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow, only the Tac+ cell fraction showed hematopoietic suppressor activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In one patient, in vitro elimination of suppressor lymphocytes by use of OKT8 antibody abolished spontaneous interferon production by bone-marrow cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that activated suppressor lymphocytes producing interferon have a role in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone-marrow failure</z:hpo>, and indicate the usefulness of defined lymphokine and phenotypic markers in the study of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
