<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to clarify the genetic cause of familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Genomic DNA of an affected individual from a multiplex consanguineous family was hybridized to a Nimblegen exome library before being sequenced on a GAIIx genome analyzer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Once the disease causing homozygous mutation had been confirmed in the consanguineous family, this gene was then analyzed for mutation in 33 uncharacterized index cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (&lt;13 years) using denaturing HPLC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Abnormal traces were confirmed by direct sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Exome sequencing identified a novel homozygous nonsense mutation in the thrombopoietin receptor gene MPL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An additional novel homozygous MPL mutation was identified in the screen of 33 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study shows for the first time a link between homozygous MPL mutations and familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It also highlights the important role of MPL in trilineage hematopoiesis </plain></SENT>
