<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Complete mtDNA nucleotide sequence was analyzed in nine and eight bone marrow specimens from Korean patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and healthy individuals, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found a large number of polymorphisms as well as apparent new mutations in both patients and controls throughout the entire mtDNA genome; 12 mutations harbored amino acid changes in patients and none of the mutations in controls produced amino acid changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were heteroplasmic mutations and more nonsynonymous mtDNA changes observed in patients, so the mean number of mtDNA aberrations of bone marrow cells showed statistically significant difference overall between patients (mean=25.6) and controls (mean=12.8) (p=0.019) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our data may support an association of mtDNA aberrations with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
