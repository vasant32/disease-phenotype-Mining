<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Their harmful potential depends on the amount of exposure to them and on the detoxifying capacity of the recipient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Genetic polymorphisms of some important detoxifying enzymes are associated with low or absent cata-lytic activity of the protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We assessed whether, in a Caucasian population, low or null activity polymorphisms of CYP3A4, GSTT1, GSTM1, GSTP1 and NQO1 were associated with the risk of developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and with the response to immunosuppressive therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: In 77 Caucasian patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and in 156 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls we evaluated the distribution of the following polymorphisms which are associated with low or no activity of the corresponding enzyme: (i)-290 A--&gt;G of the CYP3A4 gene, deletions of (ii) GSTT1 and (iii) GSTM1 genes, (iv) 313A--&gt;G of the GSTP1 gene and (v) 609 C--&gt;T of the NQO1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The distribution of the genotypes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> tested polymorphisms was not different in patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No differences were seen among the patients when the group was subdivided by age and severity of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only the GSTM1 null genotype was significantly more frequent in male patients than in male controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> tested polymorphisms did not differ in patients who did or did not respond to immunosuppressive therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: The low/null activity polymorphisms of the detoxifying enzymes CYP3A4, GSTT1, GSTM1, GSTP1 and NQO1 are not associated with the risk of developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> or to the response to immunosuppressive therapy in Caucasian patients </plain></SENT>
