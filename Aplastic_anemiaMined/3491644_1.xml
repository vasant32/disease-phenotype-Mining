<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We examined the effects of the urinary extracts from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001973'>idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi>) patients, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects on murine megakaryocyte/platelet production in vivo and in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the first study, single doses of AA urinary protein (65%-90% <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> precipitate) were individually injected intraperitoneally into rats and mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Blood platelet counts in rats increased significantly 24 hours after the injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Total megakaryocyte colony-forming units (CFU-Meg) in mouse spleens increased by 24 hours postinjection, peaked at 48 hours and returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels at 96 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Changes in the number of megakaryocyte colonies showed similar patterns of increasing, peaking and returning to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels postinjection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the second study, we compared the effects of some urinary extracts on murine megakaryocyte/platelet production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These observations provided the evidence that AA urinary extracts contain a factor that directly stimulates megakaryocyte progenitor cell proliferation in mouse spleen in vivo as well as the release of platelets from megakaryocytes, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> urinary extracts do not contain increased levels of Meg-CSF and/or some other factor that directly stimulates CFU-Meg in vivo, and the decreased blood platelet mass that is clinically characteristic of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> is not a primary in vivo determinant of the elaboration of these factors </plain></SENT>
