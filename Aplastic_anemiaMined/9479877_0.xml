<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow specimens showed maturation arrest of myeloid precursor cells despite sustained engraftment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic analyses revealed complete donor-type chimerism in hematopoietic cells and mixed lymphoid chimerism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient received a second BMT from the same donor following more intensive conditioning, including total body irradiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neutrophil recovery was rapid and complete donor-type hematopoietic and lymphoid chimerism was observed within three weeks of the second transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The present case suggests that prolonged selective <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> following BMT is due to residual host-derived immunity which is resistant to the standard immunosuppressive conditioning used prior to BMT for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
