<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 16-year-old female patient who had been given a diagnosis of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> underwent 2 courses of a combined regimen of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> pulse therapy and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This proved ineffective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Antilymphocyte globulin therapy was also ineffective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient was then given <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6504">lithium carbonate</z:chebi> at a dose of 600 mg/day in combination with an <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi> derivative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This had a dramatic effect on her peripheral blood smear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Within 3 weeks after the first course of this treatment, she no longer required red blood cell transfusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Also, once the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6504">lithium carbonate</z:chebi> dose was increased to 1,200 mg/day, the patient no longer needed exogenous platelet transfusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Approximately 6 months after the start of combination therapy, a peripheral blood smear showed entirely <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, 2 months after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6504">lithium carbonate</z:chebi> was discontinued probably as a result of drug-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001410'>liver dysfunction</z:hpo>, both <z:mp ids='MP_0000221'>leukocytopenia</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> reappeared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6504">lithium carbonate</z:chebi> was readministered at a dose of 400 mg/day, and later at a dose of 800 mg/day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Again, the patient showed improvements in 3 blood components without any adverse effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We concluded that <z:chebi fb="32" ids="30145">lithium</z:chebi> therapy was remarkably useful for this patient with intractable and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
