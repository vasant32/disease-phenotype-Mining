<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIMS: To assess the prevalence of prior aID in patients with AA recorded in the registry of the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) and to evaluate treatment and outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 1,251 AA patients from 18 EBMT centers were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty patients (4%) were eligible: 22 males and 28 females with a median age of 46 years at the diagnosis of aID and of 51 years at the diagnosis of AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Information on the treatment of AA was available in 49 patients: 38 received only immunosuppressive therapy (IST), 8 patients underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) - 6 as first-line therapy and 2 after failure of IST - whilst 3 patients had a spontaneous recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After a median follow-up of 3.19 years, 32 patients were alive, including 7 of the 8 patients who underwent HSCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only 6 of 32 patients who were alive at the last follow-up were receiving IST for AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Most cases of AA following aID benefitted from IST or HSCT if a matched donor was available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Further prospective investigation is needed to assess the effects of IST on the outcome of underlying aID </plain></SENT>
