<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The ability of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AAS</z:e> to augment MK colony formation (colony-forming unit, CFU-MK) was neutralized by an antiserum against MK colony-stimulating factor (MK-CSF), a <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> isolated from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AAS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The adsorbed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AAS</z:e> still retained the ability to accelerate cytoplasmic maturation of recognizable MK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Similar experiments were done with thrombocytopoiesis-stimulating factor (TSF) and an anti-TSF antiserum to further define the activity in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AAS</z:e> responsible for accelerating cytoplasmic maturation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow fractions enriched for recognizable human MK, but devoid of CFU-MK, were obtained by centrifugal elutriation and placed in short-term liquid cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MK progressed through identifiable maturation stages (1-4) more quickly in the presence of either TSF or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AAS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>TSF slightly enhanced the cloning efficiencies of CFU-MK, but did not alter the number of MK in individual colonies derived from non-adherent, low-density, T-cell-depleted bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin 3 (IL-3), and crude <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AAS</z:e> substantially augmented both MK colony formation and cells per colony </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>TSF also doubled the percent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37983">35S</z:chebi> incorporation into platelets of immunothrombocythemic mice, but stimulation was completely abolished by anti-TSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Anti-TSF antiserum was then used to analyze the promotion of MK colony formation by cytokines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Cloning efficiencies of CFU-MK were reduced to baseline values when TSF was pretreated with anti-TSF; however, the MK colony-stimulating activity (MK-CSA) of GM-CSF, IL-3, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AAS</z:e> was not altered by adsorption with anti-TSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the cytoplasmic maturation of recognizable MK was slower, and fewer mature stage-4 cells were present at days 1-3 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AAS</z:e> adsorbed with anti-TSF than MK cultured in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AAS</z:e> treated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rabbit serum or untreated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AAS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Therefore, TSF appears to be a major factor in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AAS</z:e> that accelerates terminal maturation of human MK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>TSF primarily affects megakaryocytopoiesis by promoting MK maturation rather than enhancing CFU-MK proliferation </plain></SENT>
