<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because of the possibility that TERC mutations might underlie seemingly acquired forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo>, we examined blood samples from a large number of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA), <z:hpo ids='HP_0004818'>paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Only 3 of 210 cases showed heterozygous TERC mutations: both nucleotide 305 (n305) (G&gt;A) and n322 (G&gt;A) were within the conserved region (CR) 4-CR5 domain; n450 (G&gt;A) was localized to the boxH/ACA domain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, only one patient (with a mutation at n305 [G&gt;A]) had clinical characteristics suggesting DKC; her blood cells contained short telomeres and her sister also suffered from <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Another 21 patients with short telomeres did not show TERC mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that cryptic DKC, at least secondary to mutations in the TERC gene, is an improbable diagnosis in patients with otherwise typical AA, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
