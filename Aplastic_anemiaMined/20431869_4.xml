<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Due to its suspected <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0858970" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenicity</z:e> and linkages with the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> in humans, CAP is banned for use in food-producing animals in the European Union (EU) and many other countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, products of animal origin originating from Asian countries entering the European market are still found noncompliant (containing CAP) on a regular basis, even when there is no history of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17698">chloramphenicol</z:chebi> use in these countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A possible explanation for the continued detection of these residues is the natural occurrence of CAP in plant material which is used as animal feed, with the consequent transfer of the substance to the animal tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Approximately 110 samples were analyzed using liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometric detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 26 samples, the presence of CAP was confirmed using the criteria for banned substances defined by the EU </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among other plant materials, samples of the Artemisia family retrieved from Mongolia and from Utah, USA, and a therapeutic herb mixture obtained from local stores in the Netherlands proved to contain CAP at levels ranging from 0.1 to 450 microg/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings may have a major impact in relation to international trade and safety to the consumer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results of this study demonstrate that noncompliant findings in animal-derived food products may in part be due to the natural occurrence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17698">chloramphenicol</z:chebi> in plant material </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This has implications for the application of current EU, USA, and other legislation and the interpretation of analytical results with respect to the consideration of CAP as a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35703">xenobiotic</z:chebi> veterinary drug residue and the regulatory actions taken upon its detection in food </plain></SENT>
