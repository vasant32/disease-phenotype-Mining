<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In recent years, attempts have been made to achieve more precise analysis by new techniques, including chemical shift imaging </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The multiple spin-echo (MSE) technique offers some advantages over conventional MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Since it allows measurement of the transverse magnetization decay curve at 32 or more points, it is capable of separating several tissue components with different relaxation times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, this technique can be used with MRI instruments having a static magnetic field as low as 1.0 Tesla </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the present study, the intramedullary cell density was assessed by MRI using the MSE technique in 4 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA), 4 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), and 5 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The water component of the marrow (with a short relaxation time) and the fat component (with a long relaxation time) were separated from each other by analyzing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images obtained using the MSE technique, and the signal intensity ratio of the 2 components was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The ratio was significantly higher in the AA group than in the other groups (AA vs. <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, P = 0.0209, AA vs. <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls, P = 0.0143) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The present technique appears promising for quantitative assessment of the intramedullary cell density </plain></SENT>
