<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In the last decade a large increase of our basic understanding concerning erythropoietin and the regulation of erythropoiesis has led to improved methods for the cell culture of human bone marrow cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These culture methods in turn have been applied to <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failures</z:hpo> with a remarkable increase in our knowledge of the pathogenesis of some of these conditions, particularly the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasias</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The pathogenesis of pure red cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> has been elucidated, and 60% of these patients have been shown to respond to cytotoxic, immunosuppressive treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow transplantation has proved to be very helpful in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and has provided impetus for increased knowledge concerning the pathogenesis of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Some of these patients may have suppression of marrow hematopoiesis by the marrow T-cells and can be successfully treated with antilymphocyte globulin or high-dose <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The future looks bright for further clinical advances concerning the <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failures</z:hpo>, but more must be learned about the pathogenesis of these <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemias</z:hpo> if improved methods of treatment are to be developed </plain></SENT>
