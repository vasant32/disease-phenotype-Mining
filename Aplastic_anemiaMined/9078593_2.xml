<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report the results of 23 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) treated with a program of 14 lymphocytapheresis (LC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Treatments were performed with apheresis machines, models Haemonetics 30-S and Baxter CS3000, using the standard program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This procedure was done because AA in many cases appears as a result of the action of a T cell population that inhibits hematopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Theoretically, removal of this clonal population would produce hematopoietic recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the total of 23 patients, 9 were excluded for final evaluation of treatment results because 7 died during or shortly after treatment (0.7-3 months); one patient abandoned treatment after three LC and another died 7 months later because of transformation to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The remaining 14 patients were included in the final evaluation of treatment; seven females and seven males, average age 46.1 years (range 22-69); 13 with severe, and one with moderate AA; 11 with recently diagnosed, and 3 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> AA; 12 without previous treatment and two treated before with antilymphocyte globulin + oxymetholone (OXM) + <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> A (CsA) with transient partial remission (PR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Besides lymphocytapheresis, 13 patients received OXM; 4 of them GM-CSF and one low dose CsA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Four patients had complete remission lasting &gt; 59.5 months (range 42-78); eight PR (average duration of &gt; 38.6 months), and two minimal remission (&gt; 37 and 29 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Platelet, reticulocyte and granulocyte counts increased on average at 48.7, 73.3 and 91.4 days, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, 14 (60.8%) of 23 patients with AA showed an improvement related to LC treatment, with a survival probability of 63% from the fourth month, the latter with an added beneficial effect of the other therapies used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Larger numbers of patients have to be treated with LC to determine its real usefulness, mechanism of action and the best conditions for its use </plain></SENT>
