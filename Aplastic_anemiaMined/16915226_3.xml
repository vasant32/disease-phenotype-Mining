<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the mechanisms underlying prolonged <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT), an index for plasma glycocalicin normalized for the individual platelet count (GCI), plasma thrombopoietin (TPO), and circulating B cells producing anti-GPIIb-IIIa antibodies were measured in 50 SCT recipients with or without prolonged <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, 42 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001973'>idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura</z:hpo>, nine patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, and 22 healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three indices were significantly higher in the SCT recipients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> than in those without (P &lt; 0.01 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> comparisons), and were significantly correlated with the platelet count in SCT recipients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Stepwise multiple regression analysis of the samples from the SCT recipients revealed that GCI and TPO independently pointed to specific mechanisms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The GCI and TPO status in SCT recipients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> had a pattern similar to that seen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, suggesting a major role for impaired thrombopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An antiplatelet antibody response was frequently detected in SCT recipients, but the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> is likely to depend on additional factors, such as reticuloendothelial function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In summary, post transplant prolonged <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> is associated with complex mechanisms, including impaired thrombopoiesis and increased platelet turnover </plain></SENT>
