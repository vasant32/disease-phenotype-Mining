<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The serum levels of interleukin-2 (IL-2) and soluble IL-2 receptor (sIL-2R) of 22 SAA patients and 15 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls were measured by immunoenzyme assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Comparing with the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls, 40.9% and 63.6% of the SAA patients had higher serum levels of IL-2 (&gt;840ng/L) and of sIL 2R (&gt;320 x 10(3) U/L), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Those who had higher IL-2 levels and higher sIL-2R levels got better responses to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi>(CsA) and CsA plus antilymphocyte globulin (ALG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The serum levels of IL-2 and sIL-2R were correlated with the responsiveness to immunosuppressive therapy in SAA patients and might be useful for directing treatment </plain></SENT>
