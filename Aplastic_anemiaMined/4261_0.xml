<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Human marrow transplantation has resulted in observations of fundamental significance in understanding both <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For example, the observation that transplanted marrow can grow successfully in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> indicates that the disease is due to a defect in the marrow precursor cells and not in the marrow microenvironment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Similarly, the observation of recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> in donor cells has important implications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nonetheless, marrow transplantation is sufficiently established therapeutically to be considered the treatment of choice for patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, and a realistic alternative for patients with recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We suggest that patients be managed with regard to marrow transplantation according to the general approach outlined in Table 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Marrow transplantation and histocompatibility typing are available at increasing numbers of institutions throughout the world </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>More and more patients with either severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> or recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> should have marrow transplantation available to them when it is indicated as part of optimal management of these no longer hopeless diseases </plain></SENT>
