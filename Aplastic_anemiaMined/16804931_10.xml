<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-one patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0003331'>HCC</z:mp> for whom other treatment modalities either were contraindicative or were unfeasible because of coexisting diseases and unfavorable conditions received proton beam therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo>, 2 patients had severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018799" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">heart disease</z:e>, 9 patients had severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo>, 1 patient had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, 1 patient had a dissecting <z:hpo ids='HP_0004953'>abdominal aortic aneurysm</z:hpo> before treatment, and 4 patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001892'>bleeding tendency</z:hpo> or unresectable <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, 2 of the latter 4 patients were allergic to <z:chebi fb="60" ids="24859">iodine</z:chebi>, and 2 other patients were unable to be catheterized for transcatheter arterial chemoembolization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_352'>Hepatic tumors</z:mpath> were solitary in 14 patients and multiple in 7 patients, and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> ranged in greatest dimension from 25 mm to 100 mm (median, 40 mm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No patient had regional lymph node or distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastasis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Total doses of 63 grays (Gy) to 84 Gy (median, 73 Gy) in 13 to 27 fractions (median, 18 fractions) were used for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> but 1 of the irradiated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> were controlled at a median follow-up of 3.3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The objective response rate was 81%, and the primary site-control rate was 93% at 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients had intrahepatic recurrences, and 2 patients had distant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">metastases</z:e> in the lungs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Four of 11 patients with intrahepatic recurrences received a second course of proton beam therapy, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0521158" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">recurrent tumors</z:e> were controlled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The overall and cause-specific survival rates were 62% and 82% at 2 years, respectively, and 33% and 67% at 5 years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Grade &gt; or =3 therapy-related toxicities were not observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Proton beam therapy was safe and effective for a variety of patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0003331'>HCC</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The current results suggested that this method was tolerable and effective, even for patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0003331'>HCC</z:mp> who had limited treatment options </plain></SENT>
