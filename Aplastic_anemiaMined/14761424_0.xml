<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: HLA-compatible sibling (pregnancy) allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (Allo-PBSCT) was successfully performed for a patient with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> caused by <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> poisoning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>9.41 x 10(8) nucleated cells/kg, 12.49 x 10(6) CD(34) positive cells/kg and CFU-GM 8.2 x 10(5)/kg were infused </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient was treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (120 mg/kg), total body radiation (8 Gy) and anti-lymphocyte globulin (60 mg/kg) before transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Donor buffy coat cells (9.02 x 10(8) nucleated cells/kg, 10.62 x 10(6) CD(34) positive cells/kg, 6.3 x 10(5) CFU-GM/kg) were infused again on day 18 after transplantation to prevent from graft failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">Graft versus host disease</z:e> prophylaxis consisted of both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The lowest ANC was 0, the lowest platelet was 3 x 10(9)/L after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patient achieved an ANC of greater than 0.5 x 10(9)/L from 21st day, and the platelet of greater than 50 x 10(9)/L from 28th day after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Grade I cGVHD was found the fourth month after grafting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Examination of recipient's bone marrow cells showed a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> 46, XX (presumably marrow donor) karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Blood group changed from B to O </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This is the first case reported in China showing a successful treatment of <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi>-induced severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> with allo-PBSCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Allo-PBSCT may be an effective remedy for this kind of patients </plain></SENT>
