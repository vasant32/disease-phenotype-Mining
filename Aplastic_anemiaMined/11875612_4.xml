<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 2-year-old boy underwent liver transplantation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004448'>fulminant hepatic failure</z:hpo> of unknown cause </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Four months later the child developed severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) was performed using marrow from his 14-month-old HLA-identical sister </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> recurred 2.5 months later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After reconditioning a second BMT was performed using the same donor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Tapering of immunosuppression 2 years after BMT led to biopsy-confirmed rejection of the liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therapy with high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> and an increase in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> A medication readily reversed rejection and a low-dose immunosuppression reflected by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> trough levels less than 50 ng/ml has been maintained since </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eight years later the boy is in excellent health with both bone marrow and liver functioning perfectly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In summary, this case demonstrates that even recurrent severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> after OLT can be cured by BMT, and that a transplanted liver can tolerate a double conditioning regimen without problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Tolerance towards the liver through BMT did not develop </plain></SENT>
