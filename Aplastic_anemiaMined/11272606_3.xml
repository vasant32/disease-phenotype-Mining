<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Presence of mixed donor-recipient chimerism (MC) within the first year after BMT frequently correlates with clinical problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To study if MC detected one year or more post-BMT was also often associated with clinical problems, the chimeric status in 33 children surviving 1-11 yr (median: 2 yr) after BMT was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A PCR with a sensitivity of 1-2%, using fluorescent primers analyzing DNA fragment length polymorphisms, was applied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>T- and B-cells and granulocytes were immunomagnetically isolated and tested separately for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the 33 patients, of whom 21 had received pretreatment including total body irradiation (TBI), 27 (82%) exhibited full donor chimerism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Six children (18%), four of whom had received pretreatment without TBI, had MC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In three of these children, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, isolated T-cell MC had not posed apparent clinical problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In two patients, both with MC including B-cells, immune <z:hpo ids='HP_0001878'>hemolytic anemia</z:hpo> was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A sixth patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> presented with MC and relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In two of the six children MC was detected only by cell subset analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, analysis of MC in leukocyte subsets is more informative than analysis of whole blood only and may reveal clinically important variations in the origin of different cell populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of MC is lower after the first year post-BMT, and when present is less often associated with clinical problems </plain></SENT>
