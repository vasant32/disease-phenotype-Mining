<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report the use of full thoracoscopic management in 19 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Nineteen patients (mean age 27 years) with diagnosed or probable <z:chebi fb="23" ids="17824,30802">IPA</z:chebi> were operated on </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seventeen had an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancy</z:e> and 2 had a refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nine patients had undergone an allogenic SCT that was complicated by a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> in 5 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 3 patients, SCT was pending </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had preoperative systemic antifungal therapy for at least 2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients had only one lesion, whereas 4 had two lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eight patients had an absolute neutrophil count less than 3,000 and 2 less than 1,000, and 9 were thrombopenic (platelet count &lt;60,000) at the day of surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Wedge resections were performed in 7 patients and lobectomies were performed for the other 12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For the latter, an open approach via posterolateral thoracotomy was decided upon in only 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>For the other 11 lobectomies, a mini-thoracotomy was needed in 3 cases for intraoperative difficulties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Conversion to conventional thoracotomy was necessary for 2 of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In total, out of the 19 patients, 15 had a total endoscopic approach, 3 had a thoracotomy, and 1 had a video-assisted approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no intraoperative mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In the group of wedge resections, no intraoperative or postoperative complication occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In the lobectomy group, three <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> occurred during dissection of the pulmonary artery in the fissure, leading to conversion to a mini-thoracotomy in 2 patients and to a classic posterolateral thoracotomy in 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>There were two minor complications: one <z:hpo ids='HP_0002107'>pneumothorax</z:hpo> and one mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0002202'>pleural effusion</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In these debilitated and immunocompromised patients, a full thoracoscopic resection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026946" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fungal infection</z:e> is feasible, even for lobectomies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>It allows a simpler postoperative course and minimizes sequelae </plain></SENT>
