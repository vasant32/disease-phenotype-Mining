<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Immune-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> model was established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Each mouse was gastrogavaged by 0.2 ml 100% composite blood-activating decoction (CBAD) twice a day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the 10th day, the bone marrow histology, CFU-F, adhesive function of the cultured stromal cell layer, bone marrow <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37370">PO2</z:chebi> were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In CBAD group, the WBC count, bone marrow karyocytes, bone marrow hematopoietic tissue volume, CFU-F count were significantly higher than those in AA group (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the adhesive function of stromal cells and bone marrow <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37370">PO2</z:chebi> recovered to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The commonly used composite blood-activating decoction could promote the recovery and oxygen-supply of bone marrow microenvironment in AA mice, and improved the bone marrow hematopoiesis </plain></SENT>
