<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the association of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001399'>liver failure</z:hpo> and aplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> has an increased mortality rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this report we describe a 16-month-old boy who presented with aplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> preceding a non-A, non-B, non-C fulminant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001399'>liver failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>He developed severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft versus host disease</z:e> (GvHD) after liver transplantation, proven by the presence of donor cells in the peripheral blood and in the skin biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>He received conventional therapy (steroids, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="168396">mycophenolate</z:chebi>, anti-IL-2 monoclonal antibodies, anti-thymocyte globulin) without success </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In an attempt to obtain T cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> and reduce the GvHD, he was treated with Alemtuzumab, a first time use for this indication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Aplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> was extensively investigated, especially exploring the possibility of primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272167" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">reticular dysgenesis</z:e> which were excluded based on clinical history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, another form of primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> could be the cause of the uncontrollable proliferation of the donor lymphocytes derived from the liver transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Despite aggressive treatment GvHD progressed and the patient died of multiorgan failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The majority of authors mention aplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> as a secondary event post liver transplant, whereas in our view this might be a haematopoietic stem cell disorder preceding <z:hpo ids='HP_0004448'>fulminant hepatic failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These patients also need to be evaluated extensively in order to exclude a primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The underlying disease will determine the choice of immunosuppressive treatment, especially in case of development of GvHD caused by the transplanted lymphocytes inhabiting the donor liver </plain></SENT>
