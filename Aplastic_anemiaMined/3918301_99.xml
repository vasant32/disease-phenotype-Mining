<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Interferon production by stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> was significantly higher than that observed in controls; spontaneous interferon production by these cells was also high for more than half of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Circulating interferon, not detectable in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals, was detected in 10 of 24 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Interferon is a potent inhibitor of hematopoietic cell proliferation and, therefore, may be the mediator of suppression in many in vitro models employing patients' cells and sera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The possible pathogenic importance of interferon in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> was suggested by an increase in hematopoietic colony formation in vitro after exposure of bone marrow cells to antiinterferon antisera (277 +/- 71% increase for patients compared to 1.6 +/- 1.6% for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interferon levels in the bone marrow sera of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> patients were high (mean = 203 international units (IU)/ml, n = 8), even in comparison to circulating levels in the same patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> bone marrow sera also contained measurable interferon but at lower levels (41 IU/ml, n = 16), indicating that interferon may be a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow product </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>High concentration of bone marrow interferon, possibly due to abnormal immunologic activity or a reaction to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042769" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">virus infection</z:e> of the bone marrow, may mediate hematopoietic suppression in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
