<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We examined the pharmacokinetics of recombinant human erythropoietin (rh-EPO) in genetically anemic mice (W/Wv genotype) to clarify its disposition mechanism in hematopoietic injury such as occurs in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After rh-EPO was administered to W/Wv and control (+/+ genotype) mice once a day for 1 week at different doses, both the hematocrit (Hct) and tissue uptake clearance (CLup) of 125I-rh-EPO by spleen and bone marrow in the femur were estimated on the eighth day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The hematocrit increased on eighth day, depending on the dose administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Compared with +/+ mice 10 times more rh-EPO was needed in W/Wv mice to produce an almost equivalent pharmacological effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In +/+ mice, the CLup of 125I-rh-EPO by spleen increased to 4-fold that of controls after treatment with rh-EPO, 4.8 microg/kg, whereas that by bone marrow remained unchanged, irrespective of the dose administered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the increase in both the Hct and CLup in spleen was minimal in W/Wv mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The CLup by bone marrow and spleen in both types of mice showed saturation with similar Km values (389-619 pM), comparable with the dissociation constant of the EPO receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, the Hct correlated with the sum of the CLup by bone marrow and spleen in both types of mice, and the correlation lines were superimposable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the pharmacological receptors govern the saturable tissue uptake not only in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mice but also in those that are anemic </plain></SENT>
