<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of the 104 registered patients, 91 were found by the central review committee to have the diagnosis of AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of the 91 patients, 84 were determined to be evaluable in this study and were treated with regimens including G-CSF (lenograstim) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A time-course study (at registration and 6 and 12 months after registration) of G-banded chromosomes, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis for <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7, and morphological assessment of bone marrow was performed with these patients during the 1-year follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>G-banding analysis demonstrated the development of cytogenetic abnormalities in 10 (16.1%) of the 62 evaluable patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most common aberration was <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>FISH analysis demonstrated <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 in 7 (10.4%) of the 67 evaluable patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Evolution into <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) was observed in 5 (7.7%) of the 65 patients who underwent morphological assessment of bone marrow </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrated that some adult AA patients exhibit evolution into <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and development of chromosomal abnormalities such as <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although the incidence seems to be comparable with that found in previous studies, further long-term follow-up will be necessary to confirm the relationship between G-CSF and the development of chromosomal abnormalities and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
