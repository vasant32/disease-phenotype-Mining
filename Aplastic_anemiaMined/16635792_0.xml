<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We compared the functional status of the hypothalamic dopaminergic tone in patients given an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) with that observed in patients with allo-HSCT without <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD and in healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effect of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> dopaminergic blockade with intravenous metoclopramide on serum prolactin (PRL) concentrations was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty volunteers, 20 to 52 years of age, seronegative for both <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> C virus and the human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> virus, were studied: (1) 10 clinically healthy men (group 1), and (2) 9 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, and 1 patient with refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> who underwent allo-HSCT, 5 of whom (3 men and 2 women) developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD (group 2), and 5 (3 men and 2 women) who did not develop <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD (group 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum PRL concentrations were measured both fasting and after intravenous administration of metoclopramide (10-mg bolus) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The area under the PRL curve was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients in group 2 were older than those in groups 1 and 3 (P&lt;.018), but their body mass index was similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fasting serum PRL concentrations were similar among the 3 groups; however, group 2 had higher PRL concentrations throughout the test (P&lt;.001) and a greater area under the PRL curve than groups 1 and 3 (P&lt;.001), without differences between the last 2 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The differences remained significant after adjustment for age (P&lt;.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results in a small group of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD after allo-HSCT suggest the existence of an increased functional level of their hypothalamic <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> tone, which would favor a tendency toward a diminished endogenous production, release of pituitary PRL, or both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This could represent an adaptive mechanism aiming to maintain circulating PRL concentrations within a physiological range </plain></SENT>
