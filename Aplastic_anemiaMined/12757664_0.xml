<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the significance of reticulated platelets (RPs) in the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0040034" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombocytopenic disorders</z:e> and the relationship between RPs and the proliferative degree of megakaryocyte (MK) in bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: With <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52293">thiazole orange</z:chebi> as a <z:chebi fb="2" ids="51121">fluorescent dye</z:chebi>, RPs were measured by analyzing the <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> content in platelets with flow cytometry and the percent and absolute counts of RPs were calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: (1) The percent and absolute counts of the RPs in a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> group were (8.4 +/- 2.5)% and (16.8 +/- 6.8) x 10(9)/L respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>(2) As compared with the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> group, the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001973'>idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001971'>hypersplenism</z:hpo> had a significantly high percent and low absolute counts of RPs (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, both the percent and absolute counts of RPs were at low levels (P &lt; 0.05 and P &lt; 0.01, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no difference of RP percentage between the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls, but the absolute counts of RPs in the former was significantly lower than that in the latter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no difference between the percent and absolute counts of RPs among <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> patients with different proliferative degree of MK in bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>(3) In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the diseases mentioned above, it was shown that RP percentage returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in the effective cases after treatment, but no such change was found in the ineffective cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Reticulated platelet counts contribute to the aetiology determination of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is also a valuable diagnostic method and a monitoring marker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There is no relationship between reticulated platelet counts and the counts of MK proliferation in bone marrow </plain></SENT>
