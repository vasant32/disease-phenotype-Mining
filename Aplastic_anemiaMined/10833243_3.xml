<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These two factors led us to test various chemical agents known to block the proliferation of leukemic lymphocytes for their ability to inhibit the immune response against soluble antigens and skin allografts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One compound, the antileukemic drug <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50667">6-mercaptopurine</z:chebi>, was effective in both test systems </plain></SENT>
