<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>None of the affected patients had a history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Median patient age was 53 years (range, 2-61 years); 10 of the affected patients were men, and 2 were women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The etiologies of AA included non-A, non-B, non-C <z:hpo ids='HP_0004448'>fulminant hepatic failure</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30480">FHF</z:chebi>) (3 patients), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (4 patients), Parvovirus-induced (1 patient), and idiopathic (4 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median duration between OLT and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of AA was 12 days (range, 11-14 days) in the 3 patients undergoing OLT for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30480">FHF</z:chebi>; in contrast, AA developed in the other 9 patients at 37 days (range, 27-51 days) after OLT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients were treated with reduction of their <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> or tacrolimus dosage, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, anti-thymocyte globulin, and Solumedrol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two of the 3 patients developing AA following OLT for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30480">FHF</z:chebi> achieved hematologic recovery 21 and 92 days after diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 9 non-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30480">FHF</z:chebi> patients developing AA after OLT died, 5 due to infectious complications and 4 following <z:mp ids='MP_0001915'>intracranial bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>AA is an unusual complication of OLT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the setting of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30480">FHF</z:chebi>, it affects young males in the early posttransplantation period, and, when infectious complications can be avoided, remission and stable allograft function can be anticipated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, in the non-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30480">FHF</z:chebi> patient, AA occurs in older individuals later in the posttransplantation period and has a uniformly poor outcome </plain></SENT>
