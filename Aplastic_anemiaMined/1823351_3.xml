<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Dose estimates of atomic bomb radiation were based on T65D, but the new dosimetry system DS86 was used for some analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The ratio of a single <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> type to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> was highest for <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> in Hiroshima, and the occurrence of <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> was thought to be most characteristic to atomic bomb radiation induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The threshold of <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> occurrence in Hiroshima is likely to be between 0.5-0.09 Gy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the threshold of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> appears to be nearly 1 Gy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the distribution of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> subtypes by FAB classification, there was no M3 case in 1 Gy or more group, although several atypical <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> cases of survivors were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> has not increased as a late effect of the atomic bomb radiation exposure, many atypical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> or other <z:mpath ids='MPATH_512'>myeloproliferative diseases</z:mpath> who had been diagnosed as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> or its related diseases have been experienced among atomic bomb survivors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Chromosome study was conducted using colony forming cells induced by hemopoietic stem cells of peripheral blood of proximal survivors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Same chromosome aberrations were observed in colony forming cells and peripheral T-cells in several atomic bomb survivors </plain></SENT>
