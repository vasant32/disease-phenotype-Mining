<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The pulmonary function of patients receiving marrow transplants was studied during a two-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The 81 patients studied before transplantation showed a slight reduction in average lung volumes and diffusing capacity (DLCO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Studies were repeated within 48 h after marrow infusion to look for evidence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_115'>fat embolism</z:mpath> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was no change in the DLCO, but there was a 4% decrease in the lung volumes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sixty-three patients (20 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, 43 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e>) completed studies on admission and every other week during hospitalization (mean of six studies per patient) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When categorized by diagnosis or conditioning regimen (including with and without total body irradiation), no differences were seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patients developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0006515'>interstitial pneumonitis</z:hpo> (IP) had restrictive ventilatory changes and decreases in the DLCO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patients not developing IP remained unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The patients developing IP averaged a 20% decrease in the DLCO before the clinical diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo>, but a decrease in the DLCO lacked specificity for predicting occurrence of IP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among 18 patients developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e>, there was no evidence of air-flow obstruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that patients developing IP have restrictive ventilatory changes, but in the absence of complicating IP, the marrow transplant regimen (including marrow infusion and total body irradiation) leaves pulmonary function largely unchanged </plain></SENT>
