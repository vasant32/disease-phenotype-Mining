<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The median number of platelet transfusions inducing refractoriness was 13 times, and 20% of the patients remained unrefractory despite of the repeated multiple platelet transfusions up to 20 to 25 times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results of anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003454'>platelet antibody</z:hpo> tasts by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay(ELISA) and immunofluorescent techniques(IFT) showed no statistically significant relationship with the refractoriness (p greater than 0.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although there was significant correlation between the results of ELISA and IFT, both tests were insufficient to find out refractoriness even with the use of pooled platelets from multiple donors as target cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This study shows that 13 single donor platelet transfusions result in refractoriness, that both ELISA and IFT are insufficient to detect refractoriness despite of their significant correlation, and that other methods than these are needed in order to detect <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948201" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">alloimmunization</z:e> </plain></SENT>
