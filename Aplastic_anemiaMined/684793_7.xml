<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>When values of recovery and survival time were reduced to very low levels, a massive infusion of platelets from randomly selected donor rabbits was given and survival study was repeated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A large increase in platelet survival and recovery was seen in every experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Similar results, although of lesser magnitude, were obtained with the infusion of platelets made nonviable by prolonged storage and, also, of lyophilized platelets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A significant increase in life span and recovery of allogenic platelets was also observed in two patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, severely allosensitized to platelets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After one massive infusion of viable or of nonviable platelets, survival and hemostatic effectiveness of subsequently infused allogenic platelets was greatly improved in both patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Experimental blockade of the RES and titration of the serum alloantibody by the <z:chebi fb="32" ids="36927">14C</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="19" ids="28790">serotonin</z:chebi> release method demonstrated that the favorable effect of the massive platelet infusions was due to the temporary adsorption of the alloantibody in the circulation of the sensitized animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This two-step procedure of one massive infusion of viable, nonviable or lyophilized allogenic platelets followed by a small infusion of freshly collected platelets may be of practical value in arresting <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> in selected thrombocytopenic patients refractory to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> types of available donor platelets because of severe and complex <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948201" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">alloimmunization</z:e> </plain></SENT>
