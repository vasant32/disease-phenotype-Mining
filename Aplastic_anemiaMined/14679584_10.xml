<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The clinical phenotype is extremely variable, therefore the diagnosis is frequently delayed until the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> appears, making diagnosis difficult on the basis of clinical manifestations alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hypersensitivity of FA cells to the clastogenic effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23704">diepoxybutane</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="23704">DEB</z:chebi>) provides a unique marker for the diagnosis before the beginning of hematological manifestations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our aim in this study was to detect FA in children with atypical manifestations to define which conditions should be routinely included in the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="23704">DEB</z:chebi> test screening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We performed the chromosomal breakage test in 34 patients with probable FA and 83 patients with clinical conditions that could suggest FA, but are not usually screened by the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="23704">DEB</z:chebi> test: 20 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, 20 patients with VACTERL association, 20 with radial ray abnormalities, 7 with tracheo-esophageal fistulae, 12 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002023'>anal atresia</z:hpo>, and 4 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found 18 DEB-positive patients: 12 were in the group of probable FA and 6 in the other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among the last ones: three were included because of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, without any other sign of FA, however when re-examined, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0158795" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">other anomalies</z:e> were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The third patient had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002023'>anal atresia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000089'>renal hypoplasia</z:hpo>, pre-axial <z:hpo ids='HP_0010442'>polydactyly</z:hpo>, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> blood cell counts and was diagnosed as having VACTERL association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The other two patients lacking physical or hematological signs were identified among the group of radial ray abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, our results highlight the need to increase the number of abnormalities indicating need for a <z:chebi fb="3" ids="23704">DEB</z:chebi> test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Delay in the diagnosis of FA may have serious consequences for the patients and their family members </plain></SENT>
