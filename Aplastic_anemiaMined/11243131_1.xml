<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Serum level of IL-8 in 24 AA patients and 20 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls was measured by sandwich enzyme linked immunosorbent assay(ELISA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The levels of IL-8 were increased significantly(P &lt; 0.05) in AA patients than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls, and the IL-8 levels in severe AA group were much higher than those in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> AA group (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum IL-8 in AA patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> were elevated significantly(P &lt; 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: IL-8 may have a potential role in the pathogenesis of AA and determination of serum IL-8 may be helpful for evaluation of severity and infectious complication of AA </plain></SENT>
