<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The most significant disorders were registered in the concentrations of component C3 and its derivatives </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Myelodisplasia usually involved a 2-3-fold decrease in C3 level matched by a rise in the concentrations of its derivatives-C3-like form and C3a fragment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Reduced C3 levels matched by increased ones of Ig were observed in some cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that disturbances in complement component level may cause changes in cascade reactions of the complement in onco-hematological patients and thus indirectly influence immune response regulation processes </plain></SENT>
