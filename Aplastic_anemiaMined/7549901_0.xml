<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We developed a sensitive method of measurement of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, which we applied in the plasma of the bone marrow aspirate in 70 patients with various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0947743,C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematological disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The lowest limit of detection by this method is 2 pg/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>G-CSF was detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but two of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Compared to the G-CSF level in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> healthy controls, those in non-Hodgkin's malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0000334'>agranulocytosis</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> were significantly higher, while the level in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> was not different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The G-CSF level in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> patients was either elevated or decreased regardless of the French-American-British subgroup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The level in <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> was not different from the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> value, as was that in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with an excess of blasts, and that in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> showed initial elevation of G-CSF with normalization after entering complete remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The G-CSF level in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> was significantly decreased, although one patient in hematological remission who was under alpha-interferon therapy showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The level in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001901'>polycythemia</z:hpo> vera was not significantly different from the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The G-CSF level for the entire group showed an inverse, although not statistically significant, correlation with the percentages of myeloid cells of the bone marrow (r = -0.174, p = 0.1703, n = 80) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results are thought to reflect the regulatory mechanism of granulopoiesis in the bone marrow in various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0947743,C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematological disorders</z:e>, and it is concluded that this method may be of clinical use in the treatment of patients with these disorders and in the selection of candidates likely to benefit from G-CSF administration </plain></SENT>
