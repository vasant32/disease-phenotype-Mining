<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The gradual <z:mpath ids='MPATH_580'>erosion</z:mpath> of telomeric length has been directly related to the process of aging in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently we have reported, in murine and human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells treated with different apoptogens, cleavage and extrusion of telomeric DNA prior to cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> on one hand and an amplification of telomeric DNA in metastatic epithelial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> of different histopathologic origin on the other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study tested our hypothesis that telomere cleavage is linked to transplant rejection in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients receiving stem cells either from bone marrow (BM) or umbilical cord blood transfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Telomere integrity and mitotic catastrophe were studied by cytogenetic and molecular fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) techniques in two BM samples taken from a male stem cell transplant recipient diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The first BM sample, which was aspirated 27 days after transplant, was mitotically active </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only one of 50 metaphases showed a chromatid break </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Every cell karyotyped was of male origin with 46, XY chromosome constitution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The second BM sample aspirated 52 days after transplant gave no metaphases and most interphase cells appeared dead </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>FISH preparations of the second BM sample showed cleavage and drastic reduction of telomeric DNA at the time the patient was rejecting the transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the first BM sample had shown no indication of cleavage of the telomeric DNA, although the percentage of telomeric area was smaller than in the control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The replicative stress imposed on the stem cells engrafted may result in an accelerated aging effect, possibly due to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_580'>erosion</z:mpath> of telomeric DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We, therefore, conclude that BM rejection could be directly associated with the cleavage, clustering, and extrusion of telomeric DNA in the donor cells </plain></SENT>
