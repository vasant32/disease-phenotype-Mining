<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) patients responsive to antilymphocyte globulin (ALG) therapy, abnormalities in both stroma and progenitor cell (PC) pool have been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The relevance of each pathophysiologic defect was characterized in 16 individuals, and data were compared to results from seven <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow mononuclear cells were split into two fractions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Stromal layers (SL) were prepared from the first, and a CD34+ enriched population was obtained by immunomagnetic selection from the second </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In cross-culture experiments, 1 x 10(4) of the latter from patients or controls were seeded on preformed SL, and adhesive PC were scored for the formation of blast colonies (CFU-Bl) on day 5 of culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nonadherent progenitors were recovered and quantitated in a standard clonogenic assay (CFU-GM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were significantly fewer CD34+ cells in the AA group (median 0.65%, SD 0.39%, vs. 1.62%, SD 1.4%; p = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No morphological or cytologic differences between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and aplastic SL were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both equally supported the growth of CFU-Bl from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> progenitors (mean 117, SD 20.4, and 103.1, SD 30.4), while this value was reduced for the aplastic PC (mean 41.06, SD 42.9; p = 0.0002, exact two-tailed test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Similarly, the AA nonadherent PC had a decreased CFU-GM growth (mean 142.6, SD 104.8, vs. mean 361.7; SD 91.3), with a lower total clonogenic output (p = 0.0009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that aplastic stroma appropriately supports the growth of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> progenitors, whereas the depressed clonogenicity of the corresponsing population derived from AA is unrelated to their attachment to SL but intrinsic to the CD34+ cells, whether adherent or not </plain></SENT>
