<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the therapeutic effects of a combined immunotherapy, high-dose immunoglobulin (HDIG) plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> A (CsA) plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> (P), in children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) and to explore the association of peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets, peripheral blood cells and marrow CD34+ cells with therapeutic effects in AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The clinical data of 46 children with AA and who received the combined immunotherapy of HDIG + CsA + P were retrospectively studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 46 children with AA, 31 (67.4%) were responded to the combined immunotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The binary logistic regression analysis showed low absolute neutrophil count (B=4.703, p&lt;0.05), low percentage of peripheral blood CD4+ cells (B=0.142, p&lt;0.05) and low ratio of peripheral blood CD4+/CD8+ (B=2.945, p&lt;0.05)were associated with poor therapeutic effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The ratio of CD34+/karyocytes of bone marrow in children with AA was lower than that in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals, but it was not significantly related to the therapeutic effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The combined immunotherapy (HDIG+CsA+P) was effective in children with AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The absolute neutrophilcount, the percentage of peripheral blood CD4+ and the ratio of peripheral blood CD4+/CD8+ were important prognostic factors in AA </plain></SENT>
