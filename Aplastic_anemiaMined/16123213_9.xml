<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because BM transplants in these patients are routinely HLA matched, any immunization responsible for increased rejection is likely against minor histocompatibility antigens (mHAs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It has been assumed that contaminating leukocytes in red blood cell (RBC) units are the main sources of immunization to mHAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, in this report, we demonstrate that antigens on donor RBCs are presented in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I pathway of recipient antigen-presenting cells, resulting in activation and expansion of recipient CD8+ T cells specific for donor mHAs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Given that human hematopoietic progenitor cells express many of the known mHAs, this observation provides a mechanism by which <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> transfusion of even stringently leukoreduced RBCs may result in sufficient mHA immunization to increase the frequency of BMT rejection </plain></SENT>
