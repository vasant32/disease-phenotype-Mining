<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To compare the suppressive effect of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), derived from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals or severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> patients (SAA), on T-cell activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied bone marrow MSC from 19 healthy donors and 23 SAA patients in different phases of the disease: at diagnosis (n = 3), following immunosuppressive therapy (IS) (n = 16), or after a bone marrow transplant (BMT) (n = 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MSC were tested for T-cell suppression in the following assays: mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR), phytohemaglutinin (PHA)-primed cultures, activation surface markers, gamma-IFN production, hematopoietic colony formation (CFC), production of cyclic <z:chebi fb="13" ids="16761">ADP</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="33942">ribose</z:chebi> (cADPR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The abnormalities of SAA MSC included: 1) significantly lower suppression of T-cell proliferation induced by alloantigens (p = 0.009) or PHA (p = 0.006); 2) impaired capacity to suppress CD38 expression on PHA-primed T cells (p = 0.001); 3) impaired ability to suppress gamma-IFN production in PHA cultures, resulting in an 11-fold higher gamma-IFN concentration; 4) no preventive effect on T cell-mediated inhibition of CFC; and 5) significantly reduced (p = 0.009) production of cADPR, a universal calcium mobilizer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MSC-mediated suppression of PHA-induced T-cell proliferation was restored to control levels in 3 of 4 patients post-BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The ability of MSC to downregulate T-cell priming, proliferation, and cytokine release is deficient in patients with SAA, persists indefinitely after immunosuppressive therapy, but seems to be restored after BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Whether these abnormalities are relevant to the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> remains to be determined </plain></SENT>
