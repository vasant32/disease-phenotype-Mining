<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 7-year-old boy was treated for posthepatitic severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> by BMT from his HLA-identical, mixed lymphocyte reaction-negative sister </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After the transplantation his peripheral blood group converted to the donor type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the patient suffered from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003677'>slowly progressive</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, and he died of multiple organ failure 21 months after BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At the autopsy diffuse and monotonous proliferation of CD68-positive macrophage-lineage cells was found to be replacing the blood-forming cells in the bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The thymus was almost empty of T lymphocytes, and remaining strands of extremely atrophic epithelial cells showed focal cystic change </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001978'>Extramedullary hematopoiesis</z:hpo> was found in the spleen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Analyses of microsatellite markers suggested the hematopoietic cells in the spleen to be of donor origin </plain></SENT>
