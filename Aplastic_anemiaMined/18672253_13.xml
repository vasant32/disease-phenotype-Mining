<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the long-term outcomes in children with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (SAA) treated with antithymocyte globulin (ATG) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> (CsA) through a retrospective analysis of the pediatric patients treated at our institution in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> protocols that included horse ATG (h-ATG) and CsA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Between 1989 and 2006, a total of 406 patients, 20% of whom were children under age 18 years, received an initial course of immunosuppressive therapy (IST) at our institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we report the outcome of 77 children who were treated with an h-ATG plus CsA-based regimen during this period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall response rate at 6 months was 74% (57/77); the cumulative incidence of relapse at 10 years was 33%, and the median time to relapse was 558 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The cumulative incidence of evolution after IST was 8.5%; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 such events occurred in partial responders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall, there were 13 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (17%), with 4 occurring within the 3 months after IST in patients who had a pretreatment absolute neutrophil count of &lt; 100/microL and the other 9 occurring more than 6 months after initiation of IST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median time to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was 570 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The overall 10-year survival for the entire cohort was 80%; long-term survival in the children who responded to IST was 89% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The long-term survival in pediatric patients who respond to IST is excellent, at about 90% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>IST remains a good alternative in pediatric patients who lack an HLA-matched sibling donor and should be offered as initial therapy before possible hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from an unrelated donor </plain></SENT>
