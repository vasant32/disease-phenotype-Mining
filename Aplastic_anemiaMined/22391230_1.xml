<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We sought to determine the prevalence of antibody (Ab)-mediated PRCA in Korea and threshold diagnostic criteria by dual parameters: Ab titer and neutralizing activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was a multi-center, cross-sectional study for two years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the first year study (1 YS), 209 samples suspected to be EPO resistance were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the second year study (2 YS), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients who consented to participate (N = 946) were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 1 YS, we found three and six serum samples that were positive and borderline for anti-EPO Abs, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The first three patients had neutralizing activity (NT) and were diagnosed as PRCA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 2 YS, seven patients were anti-EPO positives and six had borderline levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among them, one patient with NT was diagnosed as PRCA and one with NT as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of PRCA was 0.106% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The correlation analysis of the 22 patients who had anti-EPO Ab showed that dual crossed cut-off lines (anti-EPO Ab titer ≥ 40 ng/ml, % NT ≥ 25%) were able to clearly isolate red cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We suggest novel diagnostic criteria for diagnosis and prediction of Ab-mediated PRCA with data from both Ab titer assays and NT bioassays </plain></SENT>
