<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The temporary latency between diagnosing of the aplastic syndrome and the leucaemic transformation was maximally 20 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By cytomorphological investigations, particularly of the judgment of anomalies of erythroblasts, no certain prognosis concerning a possible development of leucaemia </plain></SENT>
