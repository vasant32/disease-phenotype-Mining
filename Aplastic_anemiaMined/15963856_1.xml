<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) is a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0678236" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rare disorder</z:e> characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151773" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypocellular bone marrow</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Though experimental and clinical data suggest that AA represents a T cell-mediated disease, neither the immune response nor the nature of inciting antigen(s) have been characterized so far </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The identification of a restricted T cell repertoire by PCR techniques in total lymphocyte populations supports an antigen-driven T cell response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In order to investigate the clonal composition, we analyzed the gene rearrangements of the T cell receptor (TCR) variable beta chain (Vbeta) at the single-cell level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: CD3(+) T lymphocytes were micromanipulated from peripheral blood and bone marrow samples of 8 AA patients and healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subsequently amplified VDJ gene segments of the TCRVbeta chain were analyzed for functional rearrangements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>More than 500 functionally rearranged TCR loci were studied for Vbeta/Jbeta gene segment usage and molecular composition of the complementary-determining region 3 (CDR3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In comparison to healthy controls, the Vbeta sequences confirmed a highly restricted T cell repertoire in AA patients at the single-cell level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both in bone marrow and peripheral blood a predominance of Vbeta13 and Jbeta2S7 was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, individual clonal T-cell expansion was identified in the majority of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, deduced CDR3 amino acid sequences revealed a high variability without common motifs among the 8 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Individual clonal T-cell expansion with high diversity of the antigen-binding sites among the analyzed patients argues for the predominance of private inciting <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> in AA </plain></SENT>
