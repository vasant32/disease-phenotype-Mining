<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> healthy donors were given rhG-CSF 10 microg/kg/day subcutaneously twice daily and PBSCs were collected on days 5 and 6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median number of infused CD34+, CD41+ and CD42+ cells were 6.61 x 10(6)/kg (range 1.47-21.41), 54.85 x 10(4)/kg (5.38-204.19), and 49.86 x 10(4)/kg (6.82-430.10), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median days of ANC 0.5 x 10(9)/L and platelet 20 x 10(9)/L were 11.5 (range 9-15) and 13 (8-33), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this study, the number of CD41+ and CD42+ cells infused much better correlated than the number of CD34+ cells infused with the time to platelet recovery of 20 x 10(9)/L in 26 patients receiving an allogeneic match sibling PBSC transplantation (r = -0.727 and P &lt; 0.001 for CD41+ cells, r = -0.806 and P &lt; 0.001 for CD42+ cells, r = -0.336 and P &gt; 0.05 for CD34+ cells) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was an inverse correlation between the number of infused CD41+ and CD42+ cells and duration of platelet engraftment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, as the number of CD41+ and CD42+ cells increased, duration of platelet engraftment (time to reach platelet count of &gt; or = 20 x 10(9)/L) shortened significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Based on this data we may conclude that flow cytometric measurement of CD41+ and CD42+ progenitor cells may provide an accurate indication of platelet reconstitutive capacity of the allogeneic PBSC transplant </plain></SENT>
