<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A human megakaryoblastic cell line (MEG-01) was investigated for the presence of protein S in culture medium and cell lysates using a specific enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) and a functional assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>When 5 X 10(5) MEG-01 cells/mL was subcultured in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), the concentration of protein S antigen in the culture medium increased progressively with time from less than 8 ng/mL on day 0 to 105.6 +/- 6.0 ng/mL on day 13 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Vitamin K2(1 microgram/mL) increased the production of functional protein S, whereas <z:chebi fb="8" ids="10033">warfarin</z:chebi> (1 microgram/mL) profoundly decreased the quantity and the specific activity of secreted protein S </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By an indirect immunofluorescent technique, protein S antigen was detected in both MEG-01 cells and human bone marrow megakaryocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunoblot analysis of culture medium revealed two distinct bands (mol wt 84,000 and 78,000) that are identical to the doublets of purified plasma protein S </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>De novo synthesis of protein S was demonstrated by the presence of specific immunoprecipitable radioactivity in the medium after 5 hours of labeling of the cells with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37983">[35S]</z:chebi>-methionine as a 84,000 mol wt protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Plasma protein S levels of nine patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> were not significantly different from those of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that megakaryocytes produce functional protein S and contain the enzymes required for the carboxylation of selected <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32483">glutamic acid residues</z:chebi>, and that protein S synthesized by megakaryocytes does not represent a main source of plasma protein S </plain></SENT>
