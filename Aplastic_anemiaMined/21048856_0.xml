<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Suggested mechanisms include a primary stem cell deficiency or defect, a secondary stem cell defect due to abnormal regulation between cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> and differentiation, or a deficient microenvironment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we have tried to investigate the alterations in hematopoietic microenvironment and underlying mechanisms involved in such alterations in an animal model of drug induced AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We presented the results of studying long term marrow culture, marrow ultra-structure, marrow adherent and hematopoietic progenitor cell colony formation, flowcytometric analysis of marrow stem and stromal progenitor populations and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> mechanism involved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The AA marrow showed impairment in cellular proliferation and maturation and failed to generate a functional stromal microenvironment even after 19 days of culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ultra-structural analysis showed a degenerated and deformed marrow cellular association in AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Colony forming units (CFUs) were also severely reduced in AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Significantly decreased marrow stem and stromal progenitor population with subsequently increased expression levels of both the extracellular and intracellular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> inducer markers in the AA marrow cells essentially pointed towards the defective hematopoiesis; moreover, a deficient and apoptotic microenvironment and the microenvironmental components might have played the important role in the possible pathogenesis of AA </plain></SENT>
