<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among these 3,715 patients, 695 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, a result indicating the relative rarity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> as compared with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of the 108 patients, 58.3% were male and 41.7% were female </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Their ages ranged from six months to 82 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>Pancytopenia</z:hpo> was severe in 42.6% of the patients, and moderate or mild in 57.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow was hypocellular in 84 patients, normocellular in 16, and hypercellular in eight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 52 (48.1%) of the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, the following etiologic factors were implicated: <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> (25 patients), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35842">antirheumatic drugs</z:chebi> (ten), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17698">chloramphenicol</z:chebi> (four), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17698">chloramphenicol</z:chebi> plus <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> or chromosome anomalies (two), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32215">thiamphenicol</z:chebi> plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35358">sulfonamide</z:chebi> (one), antituberculous drugs (three), daraprim (three), <z:chebi fb="57" ids="24852">insecticides</z:chebi> (two), <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> (one), and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35358">sulfonamide</z:chebi> (one) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Data indicate that the degree of bone-marrow cellularity is not always related to functional capacity, and numerous agents may have etiologic roles in the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
