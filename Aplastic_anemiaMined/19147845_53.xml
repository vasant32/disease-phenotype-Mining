<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Loss of telomerase function produces short telomeres, potentially resulting in chromosome recombination, end-to-end fusion, and recognition as damaged DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated whether mutations in telomerase genes also occur in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We screened bone marrow samples from 133 consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> and 198 controls for variations in TERT and TERC genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An additional 89 patients from a second cohort, selected based on cytogenetic status, and 528 controls were further examined for mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A third cohort of 372 patients and 384 controls were specifically tested for one TERT gene variant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the first cohort, 11 patients carried missense TERT gene variants that were not present in controls (P &lt; 0.0001); in the second cohort, TERT mutations were associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 and inversion 16 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mutation germ-line origin was demonstrated in 5 patients from whom other tissues were available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Analysis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 cohorts (n = 594) for the most common gene variant (A1062T) indicated a prevalence 3 times higher in patients than in controls (n = 1,110; P = 0.0009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Introduction of TERT mutants into telomerase-deficient cells resulted in loss of enzymatic activity by haploinsufficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Inherited mutations in TERT that reduce telomerase activity are risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We propose that short and dysfunctional telomeres limit <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> stem cell proliferation and predispose for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> by selection of stem cells with defective DNA damage responses that are prone to genome instability </plain></SENT>
