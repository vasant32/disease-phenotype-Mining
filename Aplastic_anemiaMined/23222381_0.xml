<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For these patients, there is the option of further IST, which may include additional courses of ATG-based IST, or attempts with alternative IST regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Alemtuzumab is a monoclonal anti-CD52 Ab, which has been recently investigated as novel IS agent for the treatment of AA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recent data from different groups have clearly demonstrated the biological efficacy of Alemtuzumab in AA patients, ruling out the initial concerns about possible unacceptable infectious risks secondary to its extremely powerful lympholytic effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Preliminary data demonstrate a remarkable efficacy, especially in the context of relapsed and, to less extent, refractory patients, whereas data in na√Øve patients are still limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the basis of these results, Alemtuzumab-based immunosuppression is a worthy option for AA and other marrow failure patients requiring a second-line IST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Here we describe a consensus regimen that the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation Severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>Aplastic Anemia</z:hpo> Working Party suggests for AA patients failing initial IST who are not indicated for SCT </plain></SENT>
