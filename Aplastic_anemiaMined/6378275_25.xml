<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients were recipients of allogeneic bone marrow for treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemias</z:hpo> (AA), or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004430'>severe combined immunodeficiencies</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0003006'>neuroblastoma</z:hpo> received autologous bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Endogenous IL2 production was not detectable (less than 0.2 U/mL) in PBMC of 18 patients and was very low in PBMC from five patients (0.5 to 1.5 U/mL), as compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (median 3.5 U/mL) or pretransplant patients (median 1.5 U/mL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The low IL2 production was associated with defective OKT3-induced proliferation of PBMC in 19 of 23 patients studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the first 6 months after BMT, 14 of 15 patients (93%) showed defective proliferation of PBMC as compared to five of eight patients (63%) tested between 7 and 18 months after BMT (P less than .1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but three patients, addition of highly purified human lymphocyte IL2 (hpIL2) restored OKT3-induced proliferation of PBMC to within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates that PBMC in patients after BMT have a defect of IL2 production but are able to express IL2 receptors in response to OKT3 antibody and to proliferate normally upon addition of hpIL2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>PBMC of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients showed similar functional defects, whether or not they received additional therapy, including various conditioning regimens prior to BMT and immunosuppressive therapy after BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest that T cell defects after BMT are most likely secondary to quantitative or qualitative defects of transplanted T lymphocytes or their precursors </plain></SENT>
