<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we examine the effect of the DKC mutations on the structure and stability of human telomerase <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> pseudoknot and CR7 domains by using NMR and thermal melting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The CR7 domain point mutation decreases stability and alters a conserved secondary structure thought to be involved in human telomerase <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> accumulation in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We find that pseudoknot constructs containing the conserved elements of the pseudoknot domain are in equilibrium with a hairpin conformation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The solution structure of the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> hairpin reveals that it forms a continuous helix containing a novel run of three consecutive U.U and a U.C base pairs closed by a pentaloop </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The six base pairs unique to the hairpin conformation are phylogenetically conserved in mammals, suggesting that this conformation is also functionally important </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The DKC mutation in the pseudoknot domain results in a shift in the equilibrium toward the hairpin form, primarily due to destabilization of the pseudoknot </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results provide insight into the effect of these mutations on telomerase structure and suggest that the catalytic cycle of telomerase involves a delicate interplay between <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> conformational states, alteration of which leads to the disease state </plain></SENT>
