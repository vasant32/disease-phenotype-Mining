<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Five patients had thrombotic episodes, and 10 needed regular blood transfusions; 2 died for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0003606'>kidney failure</z:mp>, and 2 spontaneously recovered from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty different PIG-A gene mutations were detected in 21/23 patients: 15 frameshift, 1 splicing, 2 nonsense, and 2 missense mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two mutations (DelG341 and IVS2 +1g-a) were detected twice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A PIG-A mutated clone was also revealed in the two patients in complete clinical remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> syndrome was treated with two courses of antilymphocyte globulin and cyclosporin with partial sustained response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Six patients were given rHu-EPO 150 U/kg/day s.c. for at least 6 months: one became transfusion-independent for 8 months and then discontinued treatment for clinical complications; one displayed a mean rise of Hb of 1.5 g/dL and is currently maintaining Hb levels higher than 9 g/dL after 54 months of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mutation specific quantitative-competitive PCR showed that the rise of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> was related to an increase of PIG-A negative molecules, suggesting that the efficacy of rHu-EPO therapy may be due to the stimulation of the abnormal clone </plain></SENT>
