<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hematopoiesis is complex, requiring self-renewing and pluripotent stem cells, differentiated progenitor and precursor cells, and supportive stroma, adipose tissue, vascular structures, and extracellular matrix </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although imaging is a vital tool in hematology research, the 3-dimensional architecture of the bone marrow tissue in situ remains largely uncharacterized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The major hindrance to imaging the intact marrow is the surrounding bone structures are almost impossible to cut/image through </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have overcome these obstacles and describe a method whereby whole-mounts of bone marrow tissue were immunostained and imaged in 3 dimensions by confocal fluorescence and reflection microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We have successfully mapped by multicolor immunofluorescence the localization pattern of as many as 4 cell features simultaneously over large tiled views and to depths of approximately 150 Î¼m </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three-dimensional images can be assessed qualitatively and quantitatively to appreciate the distribution of cell types and their interrelationships, with minimal perturbations of the tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We demonstrate its application to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mouse and human marrow, to murine models of marrow failure, and to patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, myeloid, and lymphoid cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The technique should be generally adaptable for basic laboratory investigation and for clinical diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
