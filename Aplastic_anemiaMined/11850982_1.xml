<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Demographic information was retrieved from the patients medical records retrospectively as well as prospectively of those patients who presented with features of aplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Their diagnosis was confirmed by performing a complete blood count and bone marrow trephine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One hundred and forty four patients were diagnosed to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>; there were 106 males and 38 females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Their ages ranged from 2 to 75 years, with a median of 17 years, 112 (77.7%) patients were below the age of 30 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (SAA) was seen in 74 (51.4%), very severe (VSAA) in 24 (16.7%) and non-severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (NSAA) in 46 (31.9%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No obvious cause could be established for 74.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients admitted using drugs known to cause AA and one was a radiographer (9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Out of 44 patients tested, 7 (15.9%) were found to have either <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> B virus markers or antibody to <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> C at the time of diagnosis of AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However it was difficult to establish a cause and effect relationship with either drugs or viruses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Aplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> is found to occur mostly in young males </plain></SENT>
