<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Graft rejection in patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (SAA) following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is strongly associated with a large number of prior transfusions and with prolonged disease duration before transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively analyzed the outcomes and the factor affecting these multitransfused SAA patients, who had received triple agent immunosuppression and high doses of stem cells to overcome rejection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In total, 113 patients with SAA who had a median 16 months (range 1-216) of disease duration were transplanted using HLA-matched sibling donors after conditioning with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (CY), procarbazine (PCB), and ATG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Graft failure occurred in 16 of the eligible 113 patients, and with a median follow-up of 30 months (range, 1-80), probability of overall rejection was 15% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Specifically, the multitransfused patients who received high doses of stem cells with T-cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> showed the lowest rejection rate, 5.6%, compared with 30.3% in multitransfused patients with bone marrow stem cells alone (P=0.0310) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Disease duration (P=0.0338) and the number of infused CD34+cells (P=0.0101) were associated with a high risk of graft rejection on multivariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ABO mismatch and the number of CD34+ cells were significant factors in the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host-disease</z:e> (GVHD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD among patients with sustained engraftment was 13/109 (11.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>With the same follow-up period, probability of disease-free survival for the entire group of patients at 6 years was 89% and the only factor associated with long-term survival was rejection (P=0.0241) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that allogeneic HSCT conditioned with triple agent immunosuppression, and specifically with high-dose stem cell return is probably an effective treatment for successful engraftment in SAA patients with a high risk of rejection </plain></SENT>
