<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Between 1970 and 1993, 40 patients received transplants for severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> from related donors other than HLA genotypically matched siblings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nine patients (group 1) were conditioned with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (Cy) at 50 mg/kg for 4 doses and received marrow from phenotypically HLA-matched relatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With the exception of one accidental <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients are alive and disease free 3-18 years after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty-one patients received marrow from HLA-mismatched relatives who differed by one or more loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fifteen of these patients (group 2) received Cy at 50 mg/kg for 4 doses without total body irradiation (TBI) and none survived </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Because of failure to sustain engraftment in 9 of 14 evaluable patients in group 2, the regimen for HLA-mismatched patients was changed in 1984 to include Cy at 60 mg/kg for 2 doses and TBI was added at 1200 cGy to increase immunosuppression (group 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sixteen patients in group 3 received marrow grafts after failure to respond to immunosuppressive therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Eight of the 16 patients in group 3 remain alive without disease between 1.5 and 11.3 years after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, transplants from phenotypically HLA-identical related donors can be carried after Cy alone and results are comparable to those observed with genotypically HLA-identical siblings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Transplants from related donors mismatched for one or more HLA loci require a more intensive conditioning regimen, for example, one containing TBI, to achieve sustained engraftment </plain></SENT>
