<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A variety of studies have established that <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> itself is not the toxic species but requires metabolism to reactive intermediates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The bioactivation of <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> is complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both primary and secondary oxidation of <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> and its metabolites are mediated via <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38559">cytochrome P-450</z:chebi> in the liver, although the role of secondary metabolism in the bone marrow is not clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Toxicity is associated with the dihydroxy metabolites, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17594">hydroquinone</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="18135">catechol</z:chebi>, which concentrate in bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="17594">Hydroquinone</z:chebi> and its terminal oxidation product, p-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16509,39439">benzoquinone</z:chebi>, have been demonstrated to be potent suppressors of cell growth in culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Suppression of lymphocyte blastogenesis by these compounds is a sulfhydryl-dependent process and occurs at concentrations that do not result in cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, or in detectable alterations in energy metabolism, intracellular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> concentration, or protein synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Recent studies suggest that these compounds and other membrane-penetrating sulfhydryl <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agents</z:chebi>, such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44485">N-ethylmaleimide</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23528">cytochalasin</z:chebi> A, and endogenous regulatory molecules, such as soluble immune response suppressor (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SIRS</z:e>), interfere with microtubule assembly in vitro and selectively interfere with microtubule-dependent cell functions at identical concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These agents appear to react with nucleophilic sulfhydryl groups essential for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15996">guanosine triphosphate</z:chebi> binding to tubulin that are particularly sensitive to sulfhydryl-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agents</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
