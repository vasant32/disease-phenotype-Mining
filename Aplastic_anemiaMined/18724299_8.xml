<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Progress in the past has included the early use of combined immunosuppressive therapy (IST) and better matching strategies to select unrelated donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Currently, the actuarial 10-year survival in 2479 patients registered within the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT), is 73 and 68% for patients receiving first-line BMT or IST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The outcome of BMT has significantly improved since 1996, and this is true for both matched sibling donor BMT as well as for alternative donor BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Survival is significantly better in children (&lt;16 years) as compared with adults (79 vs 68%, P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, there has been no significant improvement over time for patients receiving IST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Again, results were significantly better in children compared with adults (81 versus 70%, P=0.001), especially in very severe <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> (83 versus 62%, P=0.0002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This report outlines some of these results as a basis for treatment strategies in SAA </plain></SENT>
