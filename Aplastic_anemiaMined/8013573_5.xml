<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previously, we showed that T lymphocytes injure pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells and cause severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in 80 to 100% of mice within 3 to 4 weeks, with changes in the bone marrow suggesting stromal injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The following models were used to study the stroma: (1) Transplantation of femurs from AA mice into <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> syngeneic CBA/J mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After 6 weeks, colony-forming unit-spleen (CFU-S) levels in the femur implants were measured in both AA and control mice (600 cGy TBI only) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>(2) Development of Dexter long-term bone marrow cultures from AA and control mice, which were used to support hematopoietic bone marrow cells (colony-forming units-granulocyte/macrophage [CFU-GM]) from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>(3) Cellulose <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">ester</z:chebi> membranes (CEM) were coated with hematopoietic stroma from AA and control mice and then implanted intraperitoneally (i.p.) into syngeneic CBA/J mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Six months later, the CEM were removed and analyzed for the presence of trilineal hematopoiesis and bone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Injury to the hematopoietic stroma was documented by the following: (1) Femurs from AA mice had a decreased number of CFU-S compared to controls; (2) Dexter cultures from AA mice formed abnormal stromal layers with a decreased capacity to support CFU-GM from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> donor mice; and (3) CEM coated with stromal cells from AA mice had a decreased capacity to support trilineal hematopoiesis and bone compared to CEM coated with marrow stroma from control mice </plain></SENT>
