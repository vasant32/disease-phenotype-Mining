<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>3 cases of pure red cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, and 2 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004859'>amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> are included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Detailed investigation of drugs taken within 6 months before <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the disease revealed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17698">chloramphenicol</z:chebi> in 20, butazones in 11 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0006562'>viral hepatitis</z:hpo> preceded the hemopoietic failure in 2 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition to various combinations of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001913'>granulocytopenia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, monocytes were diminished in 35 and lymphocytes in 12 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Acid serum or <z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi> tests were consistently negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patients were treated by short-term <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi>, long-term <z:chebi fb="5" ids="50113">androgens</z:chebi> and red cell and platelet substitution as needed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>2 years after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the disease, 33 per cent were in partial or complete remission, 30 per cent survived without remission, and 35 per cent had decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Correlation of various parameters with remission and survival showed the presence of a subgroup at risque, comprising patients with low marrow cellularity and clinically relevant diminution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three cell lines at the time of diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Absolute <z:hpo ids='HP_0001888'>lymphopenia</z:hpo> and increase of plasma cells in the bone marrow were of poor prognostic significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In this subgroup two years after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the disease only 32 percent survivors and 16 per cent remissions were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was no conclusive evidence for the therapeutic value of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="5" ids="50113">androgens</z:chebi> in our series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The present situation in severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> requires more effective forms of treatment and justifies experimental therapies like bone marrow transplantation </plain></SENT>
