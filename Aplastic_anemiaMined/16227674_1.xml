<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is believed that patients with a reduced ability to detoxify environmental toxins are at increased risk of developing AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="38559">Cytochrome P450</z:chebi> (CYP450) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> S transferase (GST) are the major phase I and phase II <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35703">xenobiotic</z:chebi>-metabolizing enzymes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the impact of the polymorphisms in CYP4501A1 and GSTM1 and GSTT1 genes on the susceptibility and disease severity in 200 patients with AA and compared the frequency with the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a significantly increased frequency of the CYP1A1m4 allele in AA patients compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (odds ratio = 3.01; 95% confidence interval 1.76-5.17; p = 0.00001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>None of the other CYP1A1 genotypes or the GST genotypes were significantly different between AA patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Altered metabolism of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="29865">benzo(a)pyrene</z:chebi> due to the polymorphism in the CYP1A1 gene might be an etiologic factor in the increased incidence of AA in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The CYP1A1m4 allele may play a role in determining the risk of AA in India </plain></SENT>
