<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Selection of the best diagnostic and therapeutic approach is often difficult, and in part depends on the risk-to-benefit ratio of various diagnostic modalities, such as bronchoscopy, bronchioalveolar lavage, percutaneous needle biopsy, and open-lung biopsy (OLB) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We reviewed our experience with OLB and bronchoscopy in a predominantly pediatric bone marrow transplantation population, and attempted to assess the frequency with which OLB results directed a therapeutic change, as well as the clinical results of any such therapeutic alteration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A retrospective chart review was conducted of 87 bone marrow transplantation recipients undergoing diagnostic OLB from 1975 to 1986 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Bronchoscopic and OLB cultures, histopathologic studies, serological data, and autopsy results were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> carefully examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An assessment of therapeutic alteration as a result of OLB was made, and clinical changes attributable to an OLB-directed therapeutic alteration were sought </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ninety-four OLBs and 37 bronchoscopic examinations were performed in 87 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had undergone bone marrow transplantation, most often for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (58/87) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (13/87) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean interval from bone marrow transplantation to OLB was 106 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no intraoperative complications, but minor postoperative surgical complications were frequent (incidence, 21%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Postoperative mortality, defined as a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> occurring within 30 days of surgery, was 45% (39/87) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Seventy-four percent of the patients (64/87) died during the course of the study, at a mean of 43 days after OLB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Most OLBs (60%) yielded a specific diagnosis, defined as the establishment of a precise cause for the infiltrate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
