<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have run three separate sets of experiments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>First, we have tested the expression of receptor <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> for granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor/interleukin 3 (GM-CSF/IL-3) and for c-kit protein on bone marrow (BM) cells from SAA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Molecular analysis revealed the presence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> transcripts for alpha and beta chains of GM-CSF/IL-3 receptor and for c-kit protein by Northern blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Second, we have tested the in vitro response to SCF of BM cells derived from 11 SAA patients: SCF induced a significant enhancement of erythroid burst forming unit (BFU-E) growth (8 to 29, p = 0.01) and allowed the formation of granulocyte/erythroid/macrophage/megakaryocyte (GEMM) colonies which were not scored in baseline culture conditions (0 to 8, p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Granulocyte-macrophage colony forming unit (CFU-GM) growth was also enhanced (4 to 20, p = 0.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This was true for patients both at diagnosis and after antilymphocyte globulin (ALG) treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We concluded that SCF can promote the in vitro growth of hemopoietic progenitors in patients with acquired SAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Third, we have tested the response to SCF of peripheral blood (PB) hemopoietic progenitors collected from patients receiving in vivo long-term treatment with granulocyte CSF (G-CSF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>When PB cells were plated directly in the presence of GM-CSF there was no colony formation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
