<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine whether Epstein-Barr virus is present in the bone marrow of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Assay of fresh and fixed bone marrow specimens for Epstein-Barr virus using immunofluorescence for nuclear antigen, Southern analysis with an Epstein-Barr virus specific probe, and in-situ hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Governmental medical referral center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Five patients were studied prospectively: three who previously had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious mononucleosis</z:e>, one with a recent <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032285" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PNEUM">pneumonitis</z:e>, and one who was asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Stored DNA samples from other patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> were also screened </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Epstein-Barr virus DNA and protein were detected in the bone marrow of 5 patients studied prospectively and in 1 of 40 patients studied retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As estimated by in-situ hybridization, about 3% to 5% of marrow cells were infected with virus in those patients who had not received <z:chebi fb="4" ids="2453">acyclovir</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, Epstein-Barr virus DNA was not detected in peripheral blood DNA of these patients, nor were Epstein-Barr virus proteins or DNA found in the bone marrow of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> donors, patients with other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic diseases</z:e>, or in 1 patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious mononucleosis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Analysis of DNA fragments by hybridization with Epstein-Barr virus probes showed a pattern dissimilar to the type of Epstein-Barr virus usually associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious mononucleosis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>Aplastic anemia</z:hpo> may be associated with Epstein-Barr virus more commonly than suspected by history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Localization of the virus in the bone marrow supports a causative role for Epstein-Barr virus in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
