<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: B-mode ultrasound (US) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0877274" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hepatic candidiasis</z:e> (HC) shows an uncharacteristic pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study is to display the pattern of HC by performing contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between May 2006 and June 2008 HC was diagnosed in 12 patients (4 female, 8 male) by clinical and sonographic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The underlying diseases were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> (n = 10), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (n = 1), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153594" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">testicular cancer</z:e> (n = 1) in either the state of complete remission (n = 10) or relapse (n = 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Due to neutropenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> after chemotherapy <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the patients had received antifungal therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When HC was diagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were afebrile and in a recovered hematological constitution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Additional diagnostic procedures were histological examination (n = 5), computed tomography (n = 8) and sonographic follow-up examinations (n = 12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were examined with B-mode US and CEUS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In B-mode US the lesions were hypoechoic (n = 12), multiple (n = 10) and &gt; 1 cm (n = 8) as well as &gt; 2 cm (n = 4) in diameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>During CEUS no enhancement of contrast media in the centre of the lesions was seen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases during both phases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Additionally, in the arterial phase, the lesions showed no rim enhancement (n = 3) (type I), an isoechoic rim enhancement (n = 5) (type II), or a hyperechoic rim enhancement (n = 4) (type III) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>During sonographic follow-up a complete regression of the lesions (n = 9) or a stable disease (n = 2) was seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>One patient died due to a relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The CEUS pattern of HC is variable but characteristic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Therefore, CEUS should be performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with suspected HC </plain></SENT>
