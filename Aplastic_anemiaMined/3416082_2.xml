<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A report on the survival rate among a substantial number of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> showed that patients who sought medical care at the hospital after 1973 had a better survival rate than those who sought care before 1973; the extent of improvement in the survival rate was almost equal to the extent of decrease in the mortality rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The supply of platelet concentrates was found to increase with the decrease in the age adjusted mortality rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although there were several factors that affected the mortality rate from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, the major recognizable factor seemed to be therapeutic improvement, mainly due to the platelet concentrates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Probably neither a decrease in the incidence nor factors related to the data processing of vital statistics played a major role </plain></SENT>
