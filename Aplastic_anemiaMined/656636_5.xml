<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition, 43 similar cases were collected from the literature and reviewed to analyze some prognostic aspects of this relatively rare but potentially serious complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical and hematological data were treated to extract some clinically meaningful factors in relation to the success and failure of pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among initial hematological parameters, no significant difference was found between successful and unsuccessful cases with an exception of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients diagnosed as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> prior to conception demonstrated an better outcome of pregnancy as well as survival rate of mother when compared with those diagnosed during pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mortality has apparently improved after the late 1950's </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Success rate of pregnancy before 1958 was 21%, while it was 67% and 71% in the era of 1959-1969 and after 1970, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> remained to be two major causes of maternal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in both eras </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Based on these observations, the currently recommendable attitude to this complication is discussed </plain></SENT>
