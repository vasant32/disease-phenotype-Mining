<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Many studies have been conducted to estimate the incidence and economic impact of adverse drug reactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most of these studies used historical data or were based on single hospital units </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Little is known, however, about the frequency of serious adverse drug reactions in general practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To estimate the incidence of serious adverse drug reactions in the community </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A prospective study during 5 consecutive working days between March 1 and April 30, 1998, was conducted among a random representative sample of 254 general practitioners in Aquitaine, France </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The main outcome measure was the number of serious adverse drug reactions (ie, resulting in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, life-threatening condition, hospitalization, incapacity, or sequel) observed by each general practitioner during the study period and validated by an expert panel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirteen validated serious adverse drug reactions, 2 of which were fatal (1 subarachnoidal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> with oral <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> and 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35610">antineoplastics</z:chebi>), were observed, resulting in an incidence density of 10.2 (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.4 to 17.5) per 1000 days of practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eleven case subjects (84.6%) were hospitalized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This represents an average of 2.6 cases per general practitioner per year, and 123,000 adverse drug reaction cases (95% CI, 65,400 to 210,000) for the 60,000 general practitioners in France </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="35610">Antineoplastics</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50249">anticoagulants</z:chebi> were the drugs most frequently involved, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">blood dyscrasia</z:e> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> were the most frequent adverse drug reactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study, which is one of the few available that has prospectively measured the incidence of serious adverse drug reactions in general practice settings, confirms that serious adverse drug reactions are a major public health concern </plain></SENT>
