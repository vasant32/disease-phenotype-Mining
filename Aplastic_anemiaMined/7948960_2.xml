<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Since the presence of erythroblasts (Ebl) in the peripheral blood of patients suspected to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) has been thought to suggest an error in diagnosis, such patients may not receive appropriate therapy promptly, with potentially fatal results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, we recently experienced patients who had the typical features of AA except for circulating Ebl, and responded well to therapy for AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined 55 untreated AA patients for the presence of circulating Ebl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seven patients (12.7%) had circulating Ebl (at least one Ebl per 200 leukocytes counted) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These seven patients showed the typical features of AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in age or hematologic parameters, including the <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of bone marrow Ebl, between the AA patients having circulating Ebl (Ebl(+) AA) and the AA patients without Ebl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> but one of the Ebl(+) AA patients responded well to the therapy for AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During 12.0-110.4 months of follow-up, transformation to other diseases did not occur, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> seven patients were alive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that circulating Ebl are not rare in patients who have otherwise typical features of AA, and that if such Ebl(+) AA patients are severely cytopenic, they should receive treatment for AA without delay </plain></SENT>
