<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study we have measured the relationship between the severity of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> and the levels of erythropoietin elimination in the urine patients (EpoU) under treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35610">cytostatic</z:chebi> drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Simultaneously other parameters used as indicators of bone marrow activity were determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest that the levels of erythropoietin depends not only by the tissue oxygen availability but by others factors related to the marrow cellularity </plain></SENT>
