<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: By flow cytometry, the percentages of NK cells (CD3(-)CD56(+)CD16(+)) and its subsets [CD3(-)CD56(bright)CD16(-)(CD56(bright)), CD3(-)CD56(dim) CD16(+)(CD56(dim)), CD3(-)CD56(-)CD16(+)] in peripheral blood lymphocytes were detected in 12 untreated patients, 30 recovered patients and 13 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls respectively from April 2010 to December 2010 in our hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>NK cells activating receptors (NKG2D and NKp46), perforin and granzyme-β of patients and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls were also detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The correlation between these changes and hematopoietic functions, including the percentages of neutrophil granulocyte (ANC%), lymphocyte and reticulocyte absolute value in peripheral blood, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> degree, percentage of granulocytes, erythrocytes, lymphocytes and megakaryocytes absolute value in bone marrow were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: (1) The percentages of NK cells (10.30% ± 6.08%) and CD56 bright cells (0.11%) in untreated patients were significantly lower than those of recovered patients (16.47% ± 8.29%, 0.68%, both P &lt; 0.05) or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (19.45% ± 6.88%, 0.53%, both P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The percentage of CD56(dim) cells in untreated patients was significantly lower than that of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (9.62% ± 6.04% vs 18.21% ± 7.16%, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The percentage of CD3(-)CD56(-)CD16(+) cells was significantly higher in recovered patients than that of untreated patients or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (0.79% vs 0.37%, 0.41%, both P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>(2) The expression of NKp46 and perforin of NK cells in untreated (88.23%, 64.97% ± 21.61%) and recovered patients (82.97%, 66.14% ± 20.73%) were significantly higher than those of healthy controls (40.99%, 42.11% ± 27.25%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>(3) The percentage of NK CD56(bright) and CD3(-)CD56(-)CD16(+) cells of patients was positively correlated with ANC% (r = 0.423, 0.609, 0.468 respectively, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.05) and the percentage of granulocytes in bone marrow (r = 0.357, 0.517, 0.434 respectively, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The percentages of NK, CD56(bright), CD56(dim) and CD3(-)CD56(-)CD16(+) cells were positively correlated with the hyperplasic degree of bone marrow (r = 0.455, 0.412, 0.404, 0.451 respectively, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.05), but they were negatively correlated with the percentage of lymphocytes in bone marrow (r = -0.522, -0.435, -0.411, -0.547 respectively, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The expression of NKG2D, NKp46, perforin and granzyme-β of NK cells had no correlation with hematopoiesis (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The lowered percentage of NK CD56(bright), CD56(dim) cells and a higher expression of perforin may cause the over-function of T lymphocytes and thus lead to hematopoietic failure in SAA </plain></SENT>
