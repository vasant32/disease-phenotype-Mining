<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We treated 14 patients by transplantation of marrow from unrelated volunteer donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eight patients had severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, 3 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> granulocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, and 3 had Fanconi's <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results are compared with those of a group of 14 similar patients transplanted concurrently from human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-mismatched family members: Sustained engraftment was achieved in 8 of 14 patients in both groups; one additional patient survived with autologous marrow reconstitution following an unrelated donor transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the unrelated donor group, 6 of 9 evaluable patients developed grade III through IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> graft-v-host disease, as compared with 4 of 9 patients after family-mismatched transplants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overall survival was similar in the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the unrelated donor group 4 of 14 (29%) patients survived (median survival 1,299 days) as compared with 5 of 14 (36%) in the mismatched-family donor group (median survival 808 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In both groups, patients with HLA phenotypically matched donors fared better than those with donors who were mismatched for one or more HLA antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the patients transplanted from HLA phenotypically matched donors 6 of 12 patients (50%) survived, as compared with 3 of 16 patients (19%) transplanted from HLA-mismatched donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that unrelated donor bone marrow transplantation (BMT) should be considered in those cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> in which the chance of cure using conventional therapy is remote and a HLA genotypically or phenotypically matched family donor is not available </plain></SENT>
