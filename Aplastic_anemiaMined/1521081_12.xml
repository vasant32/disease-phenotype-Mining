<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The first part is a retrospective analysis of 40 unrelated transplants [UD-BMT] for severe acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> [SAA], performed at five transplant centers between 1981 and 1990 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The second is an interim analysis of 15 UD-BMT for SAA compared with a matched cohort of 16 sibling transplants [ID-BMT] carried out since February 1989 using prospectively collected data provided by the IMUST Study Group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the retrospective study the actuarial survival was 28% [+/- 15] with a median follow-up of 1485 [266-3890] days post BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Univariate analysis showed a considerable survival advantage for patients younger than 15 years at BMT [p = 0.03] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>More recently patients entered in the IMUST Study showed an actuarial survival of 50% [+/- 27] for UD-BMT compared with 58% [+/- 31] for ID-BMT recipients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that UD-BMT is a realistic option for paediatric patients with SAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although numbers are very small there is some indication from IMUST Study data that better patient selection and intensive BMT protocols may also improve the results of UD-BMT in young adult patients with SAA </plain></SENT>
