<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have analyzed the factors associated with engraftment in 216 recipients of T-cell depleted allogeneic HLA identical sibling marrow transplants using Campath 1 monoclonal antihuman lymphocyte (CD52) antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patient population consisted of 168 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e>, 26 with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (SAA), and 22 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852325" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemoglobinopathies</z:e>, half of whom received marrow treated in vitro with Campath-1M (IgM) and half received marrow with Campath-1G (IgG2b isotype) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with durable engraftment had fast hematopoietic recovery: SAA patients reached ANC &gt; 0.5 x 10(6)/L on Day 14; those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> attained ANC &gt; 0.5 x 10(6)/L on Days 18, 17, and 15 for ANLL, ALL and <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> respectively, while patients with thalasemia reached ANC &gt; 0.5 x 10(6)/L on Day 21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Overall, 24 patients (17 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, 4 with SAA, and 3 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039730" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thalassemia</z:e>) suffered graft failure: 10 patients (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> grafted with Campath-1M) rejected their grafts, while 14 others (9 grafted with Campath-1M, and 5 with 1G isotype) never engrafted (p = 0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis revealed that neither pretransplant protocol, nor stage of disease or type of antibody used, donor sex and ABO match had any impact on engraftment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The variables favorably associated with engraftment were older age (p = 0.030, RR = 1.016) and CFU-GM number (p = 0.013, RR = 1.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with ANLL or SAA had a better chance to engraft (p = 0.027, RR = 1.400; and p = 0.003, RR = 2.677, respectively) compared to patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039730" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thalassemia</z:e> (p = 0.001, RR = 0.551) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A higher concentration of Campath-1 antibody in vitro and in vivo adversely affected engraftment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our data show that satisfactory engraftment can be achieved in patients transplanted with Campath-1 treated marrow allografts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, despite the measures undertaken to prevent rejection, graft failure still poses a problem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further pretransplant immunosuppression and perhaps more selective T-cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> may reduce the increased graft failure in these patients </plain></SENT>
