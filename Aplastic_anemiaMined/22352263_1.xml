<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the influence of cell source on the clinical outcome of SC transplantation is not yet well established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to compare the results of PBSC transplantation (PBSCT) with bone marrow transplantation (BMT) on the basis of engraftment, frequency and severity of immediate (mucositis, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">Graft versus Host Disease</z:e>--aGvHD) and delayed (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GvHD--cGvHD) complications, as well as transplant-related mortality (TRM), transfusion needs, relapses and overall survival (OS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed 158 patients, women/men ratio 64/94 median age 29 (range 9-57), who underwent allogeneic SC transplantation between 1989 and 2009 </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patients underwent transplantations were divided into two groups: BMT group (74 patients) and PBSCT group (84 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Each recipient had HLA identical sibling donor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SCs from bone marrow were collected by multiple <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspirations</z:hpo> of iliac bone and from PB by one "Large Volume Leukapheresis" (after recombinant human granulocyte colony stimulating factor, rHuG-CSF) application (5-12 microg/kgbm, 5 days) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Engraftment, according to the count of polymorphonuclear and platelets, were significantly (p &lt; 0.001) faster in the PBSCT vs BMT group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The needs for transfusion support were significantly (P &lt; 0.01) higher in the BMT group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Those patients had more frequently oropharingeal mucositis grade 3/4 (33.3% vs 10.0%, p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in the incidence of aGvHD and cGvHD between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The patients who underwent PBSCT had more frequently extensive cGvHD in comparison with the BMT group (29.1% vs 11.29%, p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>SC source (SCS) had no significant influence on the TRM (21.62% vs 23.8%, p = 0.64) and the incidence of relapses (21.6% vs 29.7%, p = 0.32) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Finally, the patients treated by BMT <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">hd</z:e> a significantly better OS (logrank 2.33, p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Conclusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>SCs harvesting from PB resulted in improved cell yield, faster engraftment, as well as in a decrease of immediate transplantation related complications with a reduced treatment cost </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Allogeneic PBSCT were associated with more frequent extensive cGvHD, while the influence of SCS in TRM and relapses was not observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Finally, the long-term OS was better in the patients treated by BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>To verify impact of SC source on transplantation (PBSCT vs BMT) overall efficacy, more larger randomized clinical studies are needed </plain></SENT>
