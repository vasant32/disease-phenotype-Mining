<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We measured serum levels of thrombopoietin (TPO), interleukin (IL)-11, and IL-6 in 90 different samples from 67 pediatric patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> (TP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cytokine levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), and the biological activity of TPO was measured using a cell line transfected with human c-mpl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In patients with impaired megakaryocytopoiesis, as found in diseases such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, amegakaryocytic TP, or TP with absent radii, we found TPO levels which were highly elevated compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values (mean=261 AU/ml, n=52, vs. 22 AU/ml in healthy controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, patients suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001973'>idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura</z:hpo> (mean=16 AU/ml, n=31) or platelet function defects (mean=23 AU/ml, n=7) demonstrated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> TPO levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The biological activity tested in the bioassay correlated well with the ELISA data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, sera of some patients with amegakaryocytic TP demonstrated a remarkably higher biological activity of TPO than expected from the ELISA data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Within the different groups there was no correlation between platelet counts and TPO levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only 27% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> samples had elevated levels of IL-11 (mean=450 pg/ml, n=20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Elevated IL-6 serum levels were detected in only 13% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> samples analyzed (mean=42 pg/ml, n=12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that megakaryocytopoiesis is regulated mainly by TPO, that it is dependent on the platelet and the megakaryocytic mass, and that IL-11 plays an additional role in supporting the platelet production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>IL-6 does not appear to be up-regulated in children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
