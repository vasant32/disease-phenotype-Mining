<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report results of a hospital-based case control study of 137 consecutive patients diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) in participating hospitals over a 4-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Diagnoses were made by a single laboratory, subjects were age- and gender-matched to two controls and interviewed concerning previous disease, work histories and exposures to potential etiologic agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Analysis was conducted on two distinct subgroups: severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (SAA) and moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="8" ids="35738">MAA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In univariate regression models, the strongest associations were observed for exposure to <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> and SAA (OR=3.12, 95% CI=1.12-8.65) and life on a farm and <z:chebi fb="8" ids="35738">MAA</z:chebi> (OR=3.08, 95% CI=1.44-6.56) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">Benzene</z:chebi> exposure did not show a strong dose-response relationship with either subtype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When accounting for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the potential confounders we considered in conditional regression models, the previous relationships persisted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Other explanatory variables included hair-dye use for <z:chebi fb="8" ids="35738">MAA</z:chebi> and farm exposures, such as livestock for SAA, although most of these additional variables fell just short of statistical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Adjusted R-squared values were only 10% for each subtype, leaving 90% of AA occurrence unexplained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that: (a) <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> exposure is more strongly related to SAA than <z:chebi fb="8" ids="35738">MAA</z:chebi>, (b) farm and livestock exposures are related to both forms of AA, confirming some previous results, and (c) a large percentage of AA remains unexplained, which may indicate that individual susceptibility has a major influence on AA occurrence </plain></SENT>
