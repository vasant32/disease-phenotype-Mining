<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to measure the level of cytokines produced by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNC) in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) and to determine their effect on the clonal growth of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow (BM) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one patients with AA and 11 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls were enrolled in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Medium conditioned by PBMNC of AA patients in the presence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi> (LPS) was found to be suppressive to the colony growth of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> BM cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, we further determined the presence in the PBMNC-conditioned medium (CM) of both inhibitory cytokines: macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha (MIP-1 alpha), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), transforming growth factor-beta 2 (TGF-beta 2), and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), and stimulatory cytokines: interleukin-3 (IL-3) and stem cell factor (SCF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Spontaneous production of MIP-1 alpha was higher in the AA patients than the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (1887 +/- 174 pg/ml vs 1643 +/- 93 pg/ml), but the difference was not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After LPS stimulation, the production of MIP-1 alpha was markedly increased in the AA patients, and its level was significantly higher than that of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (2360 +/- 149 pg/ml vs 1517 +/- 92 pg/ml, p = 0.0022) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The level of TNF alpha was also higher in the AA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, IFN-gamma, TGF-beta 2, SCF, and IL-3 were not detectable in the PBMNC-CM of either AA patients or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normals</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The myelopoietic suppressing effect of AA-PBMNC-CM from each AA patient was significantly blocked by pretreatment with anti-TNF-alpha, resulting in a colony-forming enhancement of 174% +/- 12% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A similar effect was noted in six of 11 AA patients by pretreatment with anti-MIP-1 alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that TNF alpha and MIP-1 alpha can be overproduced by the PBMNC of some AA patients, which may play a role in the progression of AA </plain></SENT>
