<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eleven of 65 evaluable patients experienced either early or late rejection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis identified previous immunosuppressive therapy with antithymocyte-globulin (ATG) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">ciclosporin</z:chebi> (CsA) as a risk factor for graft rejection (relative risk: 16.6, P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients who received ATG and CsA had a significantly lower probability of failure-free survival than those who did not (69.7 +/- 6.2% vs. 87.9 +/- 8.0%, P = 0.044) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that BMT should be instituted immediately in children with severe AA who have human leucocyte antigen-identical siblings </plain></SENT>
