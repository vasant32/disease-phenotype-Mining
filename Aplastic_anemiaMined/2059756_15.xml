<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated whether the conditioning regimen affected the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-four patients, four with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and 30 with a lymphohemopoietic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e>, were prepared for transplantation either with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (CY) alone, with CY combined with total body irradiation (TBI) or CY combined with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> and either TBI or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>GVHD prophylaxis included <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> (MTX 10 mg/m2) given on days 1, 3 and 6, and daily <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> (CSP) on days--1 through 180 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The overall incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD was 36% (15% for HLA identical, 87% for HLA non-identical recipients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, when assessed by the severity of conditioning regimen-related toxicity, the incidence of GVHD grades II-IV (HLA identical; HLA non-identical) was 0% (0%; 0%), 37% (20%; 67%) and 50% (22%; 100%) for patients with mild, moderate and severe toxicity, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Compliance with GVHD prophylaxis declined with increasing intensity and toxicity of the conditioning regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that a regimen of three doses of MTX and daily CSP is as effective as four doses of MTX/CSP for GVHD prophylaxis in patients given HLA identical marrow grafts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, GVHD regimen compliance and efficacy of GVHD prevention are inversely related to the intensity of the conditioning regimen </plain></SENT>
