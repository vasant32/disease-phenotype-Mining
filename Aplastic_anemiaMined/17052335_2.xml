<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>Aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) is a <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> syndrome mostly characterized by an immune-mediated destruction of marrow hematopoietic progenitor/stem cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The resulting hypocellularity limits a detailed analysis of the cellular immune response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To overcome this technical problem we performed a microarray analysis of CD3+ T-cells derived from bone marrow aspirates and peripheral blood samples of newly diagnosed AA patients and healthy volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two AA patients were additionally analyzed after achieving a partial remission following immunosuppression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The regulation of selected candidate genes was confirmed by real-time RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among more than 22,200 transcripts, 583 genes were differentially expressed in the bone marrow of AA patients compared to healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Dysregulated genes are involved in T-cell mediated cytotoxicity, immune response of Th1 differentiated T-cells, and major regulators of immune function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In hematological remission the expression levels of several candidate genes tend to normalize, such as immune regulators and genes involved in proinflammatory immune response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our study suggests a pivotal role of Th1/Tc1 differentiated T-cells in immune-mediated marrow destruction of AA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Most importantly, immune regulatory genes could be identified, which are likely involved in the recovery of hematopoiesis and may help to design new therapeutic strategies in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> syndromes </plain></SENT>
