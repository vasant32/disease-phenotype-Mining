<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Currently bone marrow transplantation (BMT) with an HLA-identical sibling donor is recommended as optimal therapy for children with acquired severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (SAA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Immunosuppressive therapy (IST) has become a very successful initial therapy for SAA in children lacking a related bone marrow donor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We wished to evaluate whether current IST regimens may be as efficacious as BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective review identified children treated for SAA over a 12-year period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Children with a related donor received a BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Children lacking a donor were treated with IST followed by a "rescue" BMT if IST was ineffective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>IST consisted of anti-thymocyte globulin and steroid +/- <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Transfusion independence and survival rates were compared between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-seven children were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Nine received a related BMT; seven of these survive and are transfusion independent (median follow-up 54 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Sixteen of 18 patients who received IST are transfusion-independent survivors, including three of four patients who received a rescue BMT (median follow-up 33.5 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Actuarial survival is 75% (95% CI = 45%, 105%) and 92% (95% CI = 78%, 107%) for the BMT and IST groups, respectively (p = 0.15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Severe toxicity was not experienced by any patient as a result of IST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Equivalent rates of transfusion independence and survival were experienced by patients receiving BMT and IST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>We propose that a prospective trial be undertaken to evaluate IST as initial therapy in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> children with SAA, to be followed by BMT if there is inadequate response </plain></SENT>
