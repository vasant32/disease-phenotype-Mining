<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The administration of G-CSF was associated with marked increase in white blood cells counts (WBC) in twelve out of 14 treated patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In one patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> the WBC decreased rapidly to the initial value after the cessation of cytokine therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Significant increase of platelet number was observed in 6 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No toxicity was encountered with the hematopoietic growth factor therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our study points to the fact that G-CSF have a stimulating effect on the regeneration of hematopoiesis, particularly within the granulopoietic compartment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The effect can be obtained both in a case of idiopathic- and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35610">cytostatic</z:chebi>-dependent marrow <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
