<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow transplantation for severe idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> was undertaken in a patient, using his monozygotic twin brother as the donor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In spite of the use of syngeneic bone marrow, failure of engraftment occurred on two occasions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In vitro studies demonstrated that natural killer (NK) cells from the recipient markedly inhibited the growth of donor bone marrow granulocyte progenitor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On a third attempt, successful bone marrow engraftment was achieved following high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, which has previously been shown to be inhibitory to NK cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We conclude that NK cell activity may play an important role in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> as well as being responsible for at least some cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
