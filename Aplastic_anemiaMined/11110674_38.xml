<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinical care is complicated by variable age at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and severity of hematologic symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recent advances in the molecular biology of FA have allowed us to investigate the relationship between FA genotype and the nature and severity of the clinical phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two hundred forty-five patients from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 7 known complementation groups (FA-A to FA-G) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mutations were detected in one of the cloned FANC genes in 169 patients; in the remainder the complementation group was assigned by cell fusion or Western blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A range of qualitative and quantitative clinical parameters was compared for each complementation group and for different classes of mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Significant phenotypic differences were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>FA-G patients had more severe cytopenia and a higher incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Somatic abnormalities were less prevalent in FA-C, but more common in the rare groups FA-D, FA-E, and FA-F </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In FA-A, patients homozygous for null mutations had an earlier <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> and a higher incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> than those with mutations producing an altered protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In FA-C, there was a later <z:hpo ids='HP_0011007'>age of onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and fewer somatic abnormalities in patients with the 322delG mutation, but there were more somatic abnormalities in patients with IVS4 + 4A --&gt; T </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This study indicates that FA patients with mutations in the FANCG gene and patients homozygous for null mutations in FANCA are high-risk groups with a poor hematologic outcome and should be considered as candidates both for frequent monitoring and early therapeutic intervention </plain></SENT>
