<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent studies have suggested that the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e> prior to stem cell transplantation is associated with decreased survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Within these studies, the criteria used to define <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e> have varied considerably </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Given the lack of consensus regarding the definition of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e> in the transplant setting, we sought to methodically examine iron status among transplant patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We studied 78 consecutive patients at risk for transfusion-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e> (diagnoses included <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, ALL, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>) who received either autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multiple measures of iron status were collected prior to transplantation and examined for their association with survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using this data, three potentially prognostic iron measures were identified and incorporated into a rational and unified scoring system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The resulting Transplant Iron Score assigns a point for each of the following variables: (1) greater than 25 red cell units transfused prior to transplantation; (2) serum ferritin &gt; 1000 ng/ml; and (3) a semi-quantitative bone marrow iron stain of 6+ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In our cohort, the score (range 0 to 3) was more closely associated with survival than any available single iron parameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, we observed an independent effect of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e> on transplant survival (p = 0.01) primarily attributable to an increase in early treatment-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (p = 0.02) and lethal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In subgroup analysis, the predictive power of the iron score was most pronounced among allogeneic transplant patients, where a high score (&gt; or = 2) was associated with a 50% absolute decrease in survival at one year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In summary, our results lend further credence to the notion that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e> prior to transplant is detrimental and suggest <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e> may predispose to a higher rate of lethal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> </plain></SENT>
