<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The platelets antigen-antibody reactions including the antibody screen and blood crossmatch were detected by MGIA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results indicated that the detection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003454'>platelet antibody</z:hpo> showed positive in 30 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA), 11 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), 24 out of 25 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and 1 out of cases of other diseases, while detection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003454'>platelet antibody</z:hpo> showed negative in 20 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteer donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003454'>platelet antibody</z:hpo> crossmatch coincidence in 112 specimens of AA, 42 specimens of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and 95 specimens of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> were 45, 20 and 40, the coincidence rates were 40.18%, 47.62% and 42.11% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean corrected count increment (CCI) in 20 patients received platelet transfusion many times was 18.2 after crossmatch and 4.7 before crossmatch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the positive rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003454'>platelet antibody</z:hpo> screening is very high in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e>, the coincidence rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003454'>platelet antibody</z:hpo> crossmatch in 249 blood samples is between 40% and 48%, and the efficiency of using crossmatched platelets in clinic is enhanced significantly </plain></SENT>
