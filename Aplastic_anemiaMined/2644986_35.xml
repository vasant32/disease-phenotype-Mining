<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ten of 11 evaluable patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> had substantial increments in granulocytes, monocytes, and eosinophils associated with myeloid and eosinophilic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> in the bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with pretreatment granulocytes greater than 0.3 x 10(9)/L had greater increments in circulating myeloid cells than patients with more severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001913'>granulocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Only one patient had improvement in erythrocytes and platelets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Blood counts fell to baseline after rhGM-CSF treatment was discontinued </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Doses up to 16 micrograms/kg/d were relatively well tolerated in the absence of extreme <z:hpo ids='HP_0001974'>leukocytosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>Fatigue</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003326'>myalgia</z:hpo> were common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three patients developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002113'>pulmonary infiltrates</z:hpo> that resolved with discontinuation of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients tended to have recurrent <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> in previously diseased tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that rhGM-CSF will increase circulating granulocytes, monocytes, and eosinophils in patients with refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further studies are necessary to determine if rhGM-CSF treatment will reduce morbidity or improve survival </plain></SENT>
