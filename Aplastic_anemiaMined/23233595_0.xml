<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A matched sibling HSCT is the treatment of choice in younger patients, whereas IST is often used in older patients or in those who lack a histocompatible sibling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Graft rejection, GVHD, and poor immune reconstitution (with associated infectious complications) limit the success of HSCT, whereas lack of response, relapse, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516669" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">clonal evolution</z:e> limit the success of IST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The historically high rate of graft rejection in SAA is now less problematic in the matched setting, but with greater rates observed with unrelated and umbilical cord donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The correlation of increasing age with the risk of GVHD and the significant morbidity and mortality of this transplantation complication continue to affect the decision to pursue HSCT versus IST as initial therapy in adults with SAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Outcomes with matched unrelated donor HSCT have improved, likely due to better donor selection, supportive care, and improved transplantation protocols </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results with mismatched unrelated donor and umbilical HSCT are not as favorable, with higher rates of graft rejection, GVHD, and infectious complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Investigation of several upfront alternative IST protocols has not improved outcomes beyond horse antithymocyte globulin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>More recently, the role of alemtuzumab in SAA has been better defined and an oral thrombomimetic, eltrombopag, is showing promising activity in refractory cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The most recent advances in HSCT and IST in SAA are discussed in this review </plain></SENT>
