<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We performed allogeneic PBSCT in 3 SAA patients from their human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical siblings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One received bone marrow after conditioning with cyclophoshamide (Cy) plus antithymocyte globulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>He had a second transplant with peripheral blood stem cells from the original donor because of a graft failure (GF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two other patients received PBSCT as a first option, with Cy as the only conditioning drug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 3 patients received short-term <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> as a postgrafting immunosupression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the latter 2 cases, no GF has been observed, and a successful and complete hematological recovery was achieved and maintained for 28 and 25 months, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, PBSCT provides a quick and complete hematological recovery in SAA patients </plain></SENT>
