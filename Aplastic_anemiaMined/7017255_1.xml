<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Six patients are alive between 10 months and more than 5 years after grafting with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> blood values and marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One patient is treated as an out patient for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> localized <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GvHD), five patients are well and without treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Six patients have died, one patient with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> the day before transplantation, three patients following rejection of grafts 32, 40 and 55 days after grafting, one patient with severe GvHD 85 days after grafting and one patient, probably with interstitial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo>, following <z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>cerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three of 6 patients who were conditioned with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">Cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (CY) only died following rejection of the graft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two adults who were conditioned with CY and "total lymphoid irradiation" and three children, who wer given unirradiated leukocyte concentrates from the marrow donor after grafting, did not reject their grafts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results of the Munich-Cooperative Group for Bone Marrow Transplantation are comparable to those of large, specialized centers for bone marrow transplantation, they indicate possibilities of cure of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> by marrow grafts from HLA-identical siblings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>They confirm that better results are obtained with earlier transplantation in the course of the disease </plain></SENT>
