<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A black patient with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> is described who underwent successful bone marrow transplantation from a sibling with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During an evaluation to identify a suitable donor, it was found that the majority of family members tested had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo>, with no familial history of significant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> or related hospitalizations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In vitro hemopoietic culture studies of marrow from the patient's HLA-MLC-matched siblings showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> numbers of pluripotential and committed hemopoietic progenitors; in vitro hemopoietic colony formation from the patient was markedly subnormal, consistent with the clinical picture of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Following appropriate conditioning therapy, marrow transplanted from one of these neutropenic sibs produced full hematopoietic reconstitution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Posttransplant marrow culture studies of the patient showed restoration of a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> pattern of in vitro hemopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The in vitro culture studies and clinical experience in this patient support the concept that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> of blacks is not primarily a marrow progenitor cell disorder but, more likely, a manifestation of a genetically determined alteration in granulocyte kinetics </plain></SENT>
