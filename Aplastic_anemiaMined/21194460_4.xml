<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, graft failure and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) are major causes of the early morbidity in Allo-HSCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: To reduce graft failure and GVHD, we treated fifteen patients with SAA using high- dose of HSCT with both G-CSF mobilized PB and BMSCs from HLA-identical siblings to treat patients with SAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had successful bone marrow engraftment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only one patient had late rejection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median time to ANC greater than 0.5 × 10(9)/L and platelet counts greater than 20 × 10(9)/L was 12 and 16.5 days, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD was 6.67% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The total three-year probability of disease-free survival was 79.8% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: HSCT with both G-CSF mobilized PB and BMSCs is a promising approach for heavily transfused and/or allo-immunized patients with SAA </plain></SENT>
