<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hemopoietic reconstitution after BMT was monitored by peripheral blood counts, counts of bone marrow cellularity, and clonal assays for hemopoietic progenitors (CFUc, CFUe, and BFUe), along with bone marrow <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The number of transplanted nucleated cells and the number of transplanted progenitors (CFUc, CFUe, and BFUe) correlated significantly with the time of reticulocyte recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The number of transplanted CFUc correlated significantly with the time of granulocyte recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Platelet recovery occurred late and showed large variations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No correlation between the transplanted cells and the recovery of nucleated cells or hemopoietic progenitors (CFUc, CFUe, and BFUe) in the bone marrow was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow cellularity and hemopoietic progenitors showed a rapid, but incomplete, recovery during the first 56 days after BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Hematologic studies on seven long-term survivors with an uncomplicated posttransplantation course revealed subnormal bone marrow cellularity and hemopoietic progenitor incidence up to three years after BMT, despite <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> peripheral blood counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The low progenitor incidence could be explained by a proliferative defect of the stem cells, compensated for by an amplification in the more differentiated compartment of hemopoiesis </plain></SENT>
