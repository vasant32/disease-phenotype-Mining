<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PTLD has been described in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) and rarely in autologous HSCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) is being increasingly utilized for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> rejection in organ transplantation, severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mainly, the use of rabbit ATG has been associated with PTLD, which is considered to be more immunosuppressive than equine ATG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The sole administration of equine ATG has rarely been associated with PTLD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Due to the increased use of these potent and novel <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressive agents</z:chebi>, it is paramount to be aware of these complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We present a 55-year-old man with an autologous HSCT who presented with an unusual case of monoclonal plasmacytic PTLD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>His <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorder</z:hpo> occurred 3 years after his HSCT and 1 month after the use of equine ATG administered for severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We review current concepts of EBV-PTLD, including risk factors, the potential for preemptive therapy and various management strategies </plain></SENT>
