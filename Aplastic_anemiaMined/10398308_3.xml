<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 374 cases were identified over a period of 3-6 years in three geographically defined and distinct regions of the country; Bangkok, Khonkaen in the northeast, and Songkla in the south </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The incidence was 3.9 cases per million persons in Bangkok, 3.0 per million in Songkla, and 5.0 per million in Khonkaen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These rates are as high or higher than in any region of Europe or Israel as reported in the International <z:mp ids='MP_0000334'>Agranulocytosis</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>Aplastic Anemia</z:hpo> Study, in which the methods and case definition were the same </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rates were stable over the course of the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were marked differences in incidence between northern and southern rural regions of Thailand, and among Bangkok suburbs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These differences, together with an unusual peak in the incidence among young people in Bangkok, suggest the possibility of occupational and environmental factors in the etiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
