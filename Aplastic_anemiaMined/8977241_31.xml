<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Flt3 ligand (flt3L) is a member of a small family of cytokines acting as tyrosine kinase receptor ligands that stimulate the proliferation of primitive hematopoietic progenitors in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To gain insight into the physiological role of flt3L in early hematopoiesis, levels of flt3L were determined in serum of patients with multilineage <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> and related to the severity of stem cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) and in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients with chemotherapy-induced transient suppression of hematopoiesis, flt3L fluctuated in an inverse relationship to the degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In severe AA at diagnosis, levels of circulating soluble flt3L were highly elevated (2,653 +/- 353 pg/mL) as compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> blood serum values of 14 +/- 39 pg/mL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Flt3L returned to near <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels within the first 3 months following successful bone marrow transplantation and in autologous remission induced by immunosuppressive therapy with antilymphocyte globulin (ALG; 100 +/- 31 and 183 +/- 14 pg/mL, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, rejection of the graft or relapse of the disease after ALG was accompanied by an increase to high pretreatment concentrations of the circulating cytokine (3,770 +/- 2,485 and 1,788 +/- 233 pg/mL, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Flt3L in serum inversely correlated with the colony-forming ability of AA bone marrow precursors in vitro (R = -.86), indicating that the concentration of the ligand reflects hematopoiesis at the progenitor cell level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Flt3L increased to 2,500 pg/mL in the serum of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> patients during chemoradiotherapy-induced bone marrow suppression and returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values along with hematopoietic recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Expression of the membrane-bound form of flt3L was significantly elevated in mononuclear bone marrow and peripheral blood cells from patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo>, suggesting de novo synthesis of the factor in response to <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The data provide a strong argument for the involvement of flt3L in the regulation of early hematopoiesis in vivo </plain></SENT>
