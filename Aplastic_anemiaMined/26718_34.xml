<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For comparison, skin biopsies from the patients obtained before transplantation, from 58 healthy individuals (mostly marrow donors) and from four syngeneic marrow recipients were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A direct immunfluorescent staining technique was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Dermo-epidermal IgM deposits were found in 11% of healthy individuals and patients before grafting but were present in 86% of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> and 39% of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with allogeneic grafts who never had GVHD or who had recovered from it and patients with syngeneic grafts showed findings not different from those in healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Findings similar to those with IgM, although less striking, were made for C3, i.e., patients who had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD had a high incidence and intensity of C3 deposits at the dermo-epidermal junction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This observation raises the possibility that humoral immunity is involved in the development of GVHD </plain></SENT>
