<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>HIM was represented as fibroblast colonies (CFUF) in in vitro culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CP suppressed the growth of not only granuloid committed progenitor cells (CFUC), but also CFUF in in vitro culture at the concentration of 10, 50 and 100 micrograms/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To analyze the function of HIM in vivo, the subcutaneous bone implantation method was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The recovery of hematopoietic stem cells in subcutaneously implanted femora of mice, which were treated with a 500 mg/kg dose of CP daily for 6 days, was significantly decreased compared to the sham treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Suppressive effect of CP on HIM was shown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The important role of the derangement of HIM on the pathogenesis of CP-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> was discussed </plain></SENT>
