<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: By FACS, the percentages of CD28, CTLA-4 expressing CD3+ CD4+ T cells and the level of Th1, Th2 in bone marrow were detected in 23 AA patients at active phase, 10 at recovery phase and 15 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The relationship between the co-stimulators, Th1, Th2, and absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: (1) The percentage of CD28 and CTLA-4 expressing CD3+ CD4+ T cells in bone marrow, and CD28+/CTLA-4+ ratios were (31.40 +/- 10.83)%, (2.45 +/- 1.30)% , and 17.02 +/- 13.44 in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls respectively, (39.84 +/- 10.89)%, (1.43 +/- 0.67)%, and 43.04 +/- 37.61 in AA at active phase, respectively, (22 +/- 9.08)%, (3.46 +/- 2.26)%, and 10.49 +/- 7.8 in AA at recovery phase, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The percentage of CD28 and CD28+/CTLA-4+ ratio were significantly higher, while CTLA-4 were lower in active phase AA patients than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These values in recovery phase AA were comparable to those in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>(The Th1, Th2, and Th1/Th2 in bone marrow were (4.21 +/- 2.11)%, (1.99 +/- 1.27)%, and 2.46 +/- 1.28 in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls respectively, (11.13 +/- 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>96)%, (2.46 +/- 1.65)%, and 5.20 +/- 1.98 in active phase AA and (5.39 +/- 4.2)9%, (2.53 +/- 2.41)%, and 2.87 +/- 1.43 in recovery phase AA, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The percentage of Th1 and Th1/Th2 ratio were significantly higher in AA patients at active phase than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>(3) The CD28+/CTLA-4+ ratio was positively related to the Th1+ /Th2+ ratio (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>ANC was negatively related to CD3+ CD4+ CD28+ T cells (P &lt; 0.01), and positively to CD3 + CD4 ' CTLA-4' T cells (P &lt; 0.01) respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: (1) The expression of CD28 was increased while CTLA-4 decreased on the membranes of CD3+ CD4+ T cells in bone marrow of AA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>(2) The abnormal expression of CD28 costimulator promoted the shift of immune balance to Thl type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>(3) The unbalance of CD28+ / CTLA-4+ is important for the immune pathophysiology of AA </plain></SENT>
