<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To define efficacy of splenectomy (SE) in current programmed therapy of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: SE efficacy was analysed in 2 stages: a retrospective study of efficacy of surgery as monotherapy (1986-1996) (74 AA patients) and of SE in programs of immunosuppressive therapy (IST) (1991-2002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Program treatment of AA patients was conducted on the base of IST algorithm developed in Hematological Research Center after many year investigations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: SE as monotherapy improved AA course in 73.3% patients with non-severe AA (<z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>) and 18.2% patients with severe AA (SAA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three and five year survival in <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi> postsplenectomy patients was 80% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One-year survivors after surgery were likely to survive long </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall survival of SAA after SE was significantly less (p &lt; 0.0001): 3-year survival - 6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SE efficacy in programs including antilymphocytic globulin (ALG) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> (CsA) was studied in 69 AA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A 85.5% response was registered to program treatment including ALG, CsA and SE, being 81% in SAA and 1% in <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Efficacy of SE in combination with CsA at the first stage <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi> treatment (a 30% positive response) was much inferior to ALG+CsA (68% response) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At stage two treatment SE improved treatment results in most of SAA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Long-term survival in SAA patients after program treatment with SE is 60% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: SE in the program of combined therapy in adult AA patients including CsA is an alternative to ALG in <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In SAA, SE can be included in the program at the first stage in ALG intolerance or in the absence of the drug, at the second stage--to overcome resistance to conducted therapy </plain></SENT>
