<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because of the paucity of effective therapies for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> states, the authors studied the biologic activity of sequential IL-3/GM-CSF in such patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: IL-3 was given subcutaneously for 5 days (at escalating doses of 0.15 microg/kg, 0.3 microg/kg, 0.6 microg/kg, 1.2 microg/kg, 2.5 microg/kg, 5.0 microg/kg, 10.0 microg/kg, or 15.0 microg/kg per day), and GM-CSF for was given subcutaneously for 9 days (at a dose of 5 microg/kg per day; Phase I 3 + 3 design) followed by 14 days of rest (total, 2 courses), then maintenance therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The majority of 38 evaluable patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most patients (79%) had neutrophil responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ten patients (26%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of whom were treated with IL-3 doses &gt;/= 1.2 microg/kg per day, had platelet responses, with a median increase of 132 x 10(9)/L (range, 41-180 x 10(9)/L) over baseline in responders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Six patients (16%) had trilineage recovery, which could be durable (the longest ongoing at 6.5 years after therapy completion) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most common toxicities were <z:hpo ids='HP_0011134'>low-grade fever</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The maximum tolerated doses were IL-3 at 10 microg/kg per day and GM-CSF at 5 microg/kg per day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Sequential IL-3/GM-CSF effectively raised blood counts in some patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> at doses that were tolerated well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that early-acting growth factors can induce durable, multilineage responses in a subset of individuals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
