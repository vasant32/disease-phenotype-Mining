<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>From May 1980 through July 1986, 26 patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, sensitized with multiple transfusions of blood products, were treated on either of two immunosuppressive regimens in preparation for bone marrow transplantation from a matched donor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There were 10 patients treated with total body irradiation (TBI), 200 cGy/fraction X 4 daily fractions (800 cGy total dose), followed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, 60 mg/kg/d X 2 d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An additional 16 patients were treated with total lymphoid irradiation (TLI) [or, if they were infants, a modified TLI or thoracoabdominal irradiation (TAI)], 100 cGy/fraction, 3 fractions/d X 2 d (600 cGy total dose), followed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, 40 mg/kg/d X 4 d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The extent of immunosuppression was similar in both groups as measured by peripheral blood lymphocyte <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> at the completion of the course of irradiation (5% of initial concentration for TBI and 24% for TLI), neutrophil engraftment (10/10 for TBI and 15/16 for TLI), and time to neutrophil engraftment (median of 22 d for TBI and 17 d for TLI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Marrow and peripheral blood cytogenetic analysis for assessment of percent donor cells was also compared in those patients in whom it was available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>2/2 patients studied with TBI had 100% donor cells, whereas 6/11 with TLI had 100% donor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the five who did not, three were stable mixed chimeras with greater than or equal to 70% donor cells, one became a mixed chimera with about 50% donor cells, but became aplastic again after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">Cyclosporine</z:chebi> A cessation 5 mo post-transplant, and the fifth reverted to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> host cells by d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>18 post-transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall actuarial survival at 2 years was 56% in the TLI group compared with 30% in the TBI group although this was not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No survival decrement has been seen after 2 years in either group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was less long-term morbidity in the TLI group compared with TBI although the numbers of surviving patients are small </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>With no difference in engraftment or survival, it is suggested that, for sensitized severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> patients, who are to receive a non-T cell-depleted marrow from a matched donor, prudent cytoreduction should include a fractionated, moderate dose irradiation regimen with maximum organ sparing, that is either TLI or TAI </plain></SENT>
