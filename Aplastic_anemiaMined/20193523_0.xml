<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty patients diagnosed with SAA received allogeneic HSCT from HLA-identical donors (17 from siblings and 3 from unrelated donors) between January 2000 and November 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Conditioning regimen consisted of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (Cy) and anti-thymocyte immunoglobulin (ATG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients were administrated with G-CSF-primed bone marrow(G-BM) and mobilized peripheral blood (G-PB) as grafts from the sibling donors or only G-PB from the unrelated donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median infused number of mononuclear cells and CD(34)(+) cells were 7.89 (4 - 14.21) x 10(8)/kg and 2.60 (0.81 - 4.45) x 10(6)/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients got engraftment with 100% donor chimerism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median time of neutrophil and platelet engraftment were 14 (11 - 20) d and 12 (8 - 108) d respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cumulative incidence rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD at 100 d was 16% (grade I: 3 cases, grade II: 3 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> GVHD occurred in 7 of the 19 evaluable cases (4 limited, 3 extensive) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Till February 28, 2009, with a median follow-up of 18 months, 17 patients were alive and the overall survival rate was 82.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The study confirms that using G-PB with or without G-BM as graft after Cy+ATG conditioning results in excellent outcome of HLA-identical HSCT in patients with SAA </plain></SENT>
