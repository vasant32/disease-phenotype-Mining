<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficiency of a prospective therapeutic protocol using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="50113">androgens</z:chebi> in the treatment of adult patients with nonsevere AAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-nine patients diagnosed and treated at the University Hospital of Sfax (Tunisia), during a 10-year period (1991-2000) were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition to symptomatic treatment (transfusion, antibiotics), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients received a specific treatment including two drugs: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> 5mg/kg per day and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="50113">androgens</z:chebi> 0,5mg/kg per day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The response rate at three, six and 12 months were 48, 75, and 87%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Survival rate was 52% at one year, and 37% at five and 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The main toxicities were hepatic, renal, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo>, observed in 53, 16 and 15%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These toxicities were reversible in 65, 87 and 100% of the cases, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The response and survival rates in our series are quite satisfactory when compared to those obtained with other immunosuppressive drugs (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> and antilymphocyte serum) in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The addition of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="50113">androgens</z:chebi> in our patients seemed to potentiate the immunosuppression induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">ciclosporin</z:chebi>, but secondary toxic effects were more common </plain></SENT>
