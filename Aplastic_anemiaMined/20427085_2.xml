<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The aims of the present study are two-fold: (1) to define the clinical features of hypoplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (h-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) in comparison with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) and (2) to evaluate the prognostic roles of karyotyping and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) in these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151773" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoplastic marrow</z:e> syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Based on a medical record review at Seoul National University Hospital, the records of 409 patients diagnosed with either h-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> or AA were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of these patients, 358 had been diagnosed with AA and 51 with h-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (median age, 39 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At diagnosis, 235 and 165 patients underwent karyotyping and FISH analysis, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Karyotypic abnormalities and <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 and <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 1q FISH abnormalities were found more frequently in h-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients than in AA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median overall survival (OS) of h-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients was shorter than that of AA patients (83 vs. 201 months, P=0.007), with the OS of h-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients falling between that of severe and very severe AA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with h-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> had more frequent leukemic conversion (P&lt;0.001) than did AA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In AA patients, karyotypic abnormality was not prognostic (P=0.646), while in h-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, abnormalities in <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 1q FISH (P=0.002) and in 20q deletion FISH (P=0.005) were predictive of poor prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the prognosis for h-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients <z:hpo ids='HP_0002527'>falls</z:hpo> between that of severe and very severe AA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Moreover, h-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> is frequently accompanied by karyotypic and FISH abnormalities and is prone to leukemic conversion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>Trisomy</z:mp> 1q and 20q deletion FISH abnormalities may have important prognostic roles in patients with h-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
