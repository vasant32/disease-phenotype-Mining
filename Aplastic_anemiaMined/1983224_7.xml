<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report here the first successful cases of transplantation of umbilical cord blood cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients were suffering from Fanconi's <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, complicated by severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During pregnancy, it was shown that the mother was carrying a sibling unaffected by the disease and with HLA identical to the patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cord blood was collected and frozen in liquid nitrogen at birth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After conditioning with low-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (20 mg/kg) and thoraco-abdominal irradiation (5 grays), the patients received a cord blood transplant of thawed cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three patients have been transplanted without any immediate side-effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One has not enough follow-up, but two patients are alive and well with complete donor hematologic reconstitution and no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft versus host disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Potential developments of this technique are an extension of applicability with regard to other diseases that might be transplanted and whether such transplants can be performed in adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The relative immaturity of the lymphoid system at birth may be advantageous in decreasing the graft versus host reaction if these cells are used in a mismatched transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Cord blood cell banks may be useful for transplants in patients lacking an HLA-identical donor </plain></SENT>
