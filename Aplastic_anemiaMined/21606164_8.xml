<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: A combination of horse anti-thymocyte globulin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> produces responses in 60-70% of patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We performed a phase II study of rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> as first-line therapy for severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: Twenty patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> treated with rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin were compared to 67 historical control cases with matched clinical characteristics treated with horse anti-thymocyte globulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Response rates at 3, 6 and 12 months were similar for patients treated with rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin or horse anti-thymocyte globulin: 40% versus 55% (P=0.43), 45% versus 58% (P=0.44) and 50% versus 58% (P=0.61), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No differences in early mortality rates or overall survival were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We then performed multivariable analyses of response at 6 months and overall survival and identified the presence of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0004818'>paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</z:hpo> clone (P=0.01) and a pretreatment absolute reticulocyte count greater than 30Ã—10(9)/L (P=0.007) as independent predictors of response and younger age (P=0.003), higher pretreatment absolute neutrophil (P=0.02) and absolute lymphocyte counts (P=0.03) as independent predictors of overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>None of the immunogenetic polymorphisms studied was predictive of response to immunosupressive therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Despite reports suggesting differences in biological activity of different anti-thymocyte globulin preparations, rabbit and horse anti-thymocyte globulin appear to have a similar efficacy for up-front treatment of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
