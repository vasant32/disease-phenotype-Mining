<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we used immune adherence PCR (IA-PCR) to bind B19 virions in recipient native liver onto solid phase with specific monoclonal antibodies followed by PCR amplification of virion DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>IA-PCR had sensitivity and specificity similar to conventional PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We examined liver tissue from 16 patients with non-A, non-B, non-C, non-E (NA-E) <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> fulminant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001399'>liver failure</z:hpo> (AFLF) (6 of unknown etiology associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA), 4 of unknown etiology without AA; and 6 patients with AFLF of known etiology) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IA-PCR detected B19 virions in 5 of 6 (83%) of livers from patients with idiopathic NA-E AFLF associated with AA and in 2 of 3 (75%) without AA, compared to 1 of 6 (17%) of livers from patients with AFLF of known etiology and to 6 of 34 (18%) of 34 control patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> or neoplastic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Detection of B19 virions and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> for capsid proteins provided strong evidence for B19 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> during the course of NA-E AFLF and argues for involvement of B19 virus in liver injury </plain></SENT>
