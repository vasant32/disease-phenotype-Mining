<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to correlate the initial clinical features of AIFRS to the prognosis after surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-two patients with AIFRS were evaluated retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The correlation of underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026946" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">disease, fungus</z:e> isolated, and extent of the disease to the clinical outcome of AIFRS was also evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The most common underlying disease was <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0848852,C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancy</z:e> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> (n=20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Aspergillus (n=13) and Mucoraceae (n=11) were the main fungi found in AIFRS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mucosal biopsy confirmed fungal invasion to the nasal mucosa in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Computed tomography and endoscopic findings showed a predominance of unilateral disease, with various stages of nasal involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients underwent surgical debridement and systemic antifungal therapy immediately after diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Sixteen patients died (50%) due to AIFRS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A poor prognosis was related to the extensiveness of AIFRS and to the underlying disease (patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> had the worst outcomes), but not to the fungus isolated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Early medical and surgical treatment is essential to improve the prognosis of AIFRS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A poorer prognosis was associated with underlying disease and extensiveness of AIFRS, but not to the fungus isolated </plain></SENT>
