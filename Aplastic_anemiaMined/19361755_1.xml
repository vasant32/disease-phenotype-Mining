<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We examined transplantation outcomes after a second HLA-matched sibling transplantation for primary (16%) or secondary (84%) graft failure in 166 patients with severe acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two-thirds of these patients has a performance score &lt; 90 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In most cases (88%), the same donor was used for both transplants, for both transplantations, and 84% of the second transplantations used bone marrow grafts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We identified 2 prognostic factors: intertransplantation interval (surrogate for primary graft failure and early secondary graft failure) and performance status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Shorter intertransplantation interval (&lt;or= 3 months) and poor performance score (&lt; 90) at second transplantation were associated with high mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In patients with a performance score of 90% to 100%, the 8-year probability of overall survival (OS) after second transplantation &lt;or= 3 and &gt; 3 months from first transplantation was 56% and 76%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The corresponding probabilities in patients with lower performance scores were 33% and 61% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The predominant cause of failure after second transplantation was nonengraftment (in 72 of 166 patients), most commonly in patients with primary or early secondary graft failure (51 of 72; 71%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our data indicate that novel approaches, including conditioning regimens with greater immunosuppression, should be explored for these patients </plain></SENT>
