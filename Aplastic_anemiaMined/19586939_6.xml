<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In vitro block of TNF-alpha and/or IFN-gamma significantly increased BFU-e over baseline in 28 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In responsive to treatment patients only TNF-alpha block significantly incremented colonies over <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Absolute marrow CD3(+)/TNF-alpha(+) and CD3(+)/IFN-gamma(+) cells prospectively tested in a group of 21 subjects declined significantly more in Responders than in Non Responders to immunosuppression at Response Evaluation Time respect to Diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both in Responders and in Non Responders these cells remained higher than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that immunosuppression does not fully clear excess TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma from marrow of patients with good outcome and raises the hypothesis that additional cytokine blockade might be useful in immunosuppression for acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
