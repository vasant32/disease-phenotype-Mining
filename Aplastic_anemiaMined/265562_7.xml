<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The levels of erythrocyte ALA-dehydratase and Uro-synthase showed marked developmental changes and ALA-dehydratase was influenced by the Lv gene </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mice with an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0240066" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron deficiency</z:e> (mk/mk) and mice with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001908'>hypoplastic anemias</z:hpo> (W/Wv, Sl/Sld, an/an) had mild to moderate increases in these parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Elevated enzyme activities and Proto correlated well with the number of reticulocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Because <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> mice with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemias</z:hpo> possessed elevated levels of ALA-dehydratase, Uro-synthase, and Proto independent of differences in their genotypes, the increase in these parameters is not likely to be the result of a specific gene defect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The increased enzyme activities and Proto concentration probably reflect increased frequency of young red cells that are still active in <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30413">heme</z:chebi> biosynthesis </plain></SENT>
