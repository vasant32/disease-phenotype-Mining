<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Seventeen patients with newly diagnosed acquired severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> were treated with a combination of immunosuppressive drugs consisting of anti-lymphocyte or anti-thymocyte globulin, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> (CyA), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi>, and recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fourteen (82%) of the 17 patients achieved good response (GR), and 3 (18%) had no response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among the 14 GR patients, 5 (36%) later evolved clonal diseases, 1 developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, and 4 developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0004818'>paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The numbers of granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units (CFU-GM) and erythrocyte burst-forming units were markedly low or absent in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases before therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After therapy, those numbers in 13 patients among 14 responders recovered to the level of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control at the time of GR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the CFU-GM number substantially declined after that but gradually recovered again to reach a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> level over longer clinical courses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The positive rate for HLA-DRB1*1501 was 60% (3/5) among 5 CyA-dependent patients, which tended to be higher than the 20% (1/5) among 5 CyA-independent patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, immunosuppressive therapy combined with G-CSF provides a high rate of good hematological response accompanied by the apparent recovery of the hematopoietic progenitor compartments </plain></SENT>
