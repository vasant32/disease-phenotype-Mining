<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Human recombinant granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rhGM-CSF) was administered to 14 patients with refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effect of rhGM-CSF therapy on the lymphocyte phenotype; on the proliferative responses to the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi> phytohemagglutinin, Candida albicans, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039614" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tetanus</z:e> toxoid antigens; and on the natural killer (NK) activity of the circulating lymphocytes was studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Samples were collected before (baseline) and twice during the rhGM-CSF administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The absolute number of circulating lymphocytes remained relatively constant during the first period, but experienced a significant increase (P less than .001) during the second period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The increase was most prominent in the B cells (P less than .001), but the T cells (P less than .016) also increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Detailed investigation of lymphocyte subsets showed an increase of the markers CD38 (Leu17), HLA-DR, and the transferrin receptor throughout the treatment course giving evidence of lymphoid cell activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The NK cell activity was suppressed (P less than .008) throughout the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, proliferative responses to phytohemagglutinin, Candida antigen, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039614" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tetanus</z:e> toxoid were unaffected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although the mechanism is not yet defined, GM-CSF does induce activation and increase in absolute lymphoid cell number, especially B cells, together with a decrease in NK cytotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The implication of these immune cell changes in relation to host resistance to microorganisms remains to be established </plain></SENT>
