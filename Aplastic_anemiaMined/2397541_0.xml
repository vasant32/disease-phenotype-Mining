<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patients were treated with the method of warming and tonifying the Spleen and Kidney by using Er-Xian decoction of warming the Kidney </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The three other types were also treated with the method after being relieved with the methods of tonifying the Heart and the Spleen, of nourishing Yin to relieve internal heat and cooling blood, and of strengthening Yang to stop <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> respectively so that function of the blood and Qi would promote each other and be improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The total effective rate was 84.5%, and remission rate was 47.6% among 84 cases, but 91.9% and 50.0% in the type of Yang-deficiency of the Spleen and Kidney alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among the effective cases there was a remarkable improvement in the hemogram after treatment (P less than 0.001, less than 0.01), and the long-termed curative effect was also exciting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mechanism of Er-Xian decoction of warming the Kidney was investigated through the nourishment of the hemopoiesis stem cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The experiment showed that the decoction could increase CFU-S and GM-CFU in the bone marrow under the lower hemopoietic function of the bone marrow, and increase GM-CFU and CFU-E in the bone marrow of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rats (P less than 0.001, less than 0.01, less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The histological findings showed that there was a reduction in <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> and hyperemia in the bone marrow between the decoction group and the control group, and the recovery of hemopoietic function was better than the latter </plain></SENT>
