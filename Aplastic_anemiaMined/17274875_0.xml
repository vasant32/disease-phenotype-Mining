<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinical studies have shown that immunosuppressive therapy greatly prolonged the long-term survival of some patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>But in severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (SAA) patients whose ANC was &lt; 0.5 x 10(9)/L, platelets were &lt; 20 x 10(9)/L, very low bone marrow proliferation and high <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The present study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of immunosuppressive treatments with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> A (CSA) alone or CSA combined with antithymocyte <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5386">globin</z:chebi> (ATG) in children with acquired SAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty-four cases with SAA were treated with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressive agents</z:chebi> mentioned above in our department from Jan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>1997 to June 2003, 31 of the cases had treated with CSA combined with ATG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were 18 cases with SAA type I and 13 cases with SAA type II in CSA combined with ATG group, and 13 cases had very severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The other 23 cases were treated with CSA alone (CSA group), 10 of these cases had SAA-I and 13 had SAA-II, and 5 cases had very severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The responsive rate, relapse, adverse reactions and event free survival (EFS) were compared between CSA combined with ATG group and CSA group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The proportions of patients with different types of the disease and severity were comparable between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The responsive time of the CSA combined with ATG group and CSA group was 2.5 months and 3.5 months, respectively (P &lt; 0.05), the responsive rate in two groups was 81% (25/31) and 52% (12/23), respectively (chi(2) = 4.962, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In 37 cases who were responsive to therapy, the relapse rate was 8% (2/25) and 50% (6/12) respectively (chi(C)(2) = 6.143, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences in adverse reactions to the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressive agents</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> cases were followed-up for more than 1 year, and the event-free survival over one year in these two groups was 81% (25/31) and 52% (12/23), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Forty-seven cases were followed-up for more than two years, and the event-free survival was 74% (20/27) and 50% (10/20), respectively (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Twelve cases were followed-up for over 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>There were no <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027627" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="mets">secondary tumor</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> and other colony diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The immunosuppressive therapies for acquired severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> in childhood were effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The effect of CSA combined with ATG was better than that of CSA alone, and the relapse rate was lower with the combined treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>However, the long-term effect needs longer follow-up studies to evaluate </plain></SENT>
