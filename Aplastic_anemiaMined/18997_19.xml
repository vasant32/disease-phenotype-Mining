<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the skin, the mild form of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHR is recognized as a subtle macular <z:hpo ids='HP_0010783'>erythema</z:hpo>, and the severe form appears as erythematous papules and violaceous macules with scale </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Skin biopsy specimens in both of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> forms show vacuolar alterations of the epidermal basal-cell layer with a perivenular infiltrate of lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
