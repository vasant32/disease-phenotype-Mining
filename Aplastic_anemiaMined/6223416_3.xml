<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A three-year-old boy with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (HLA-A1,B8(Bw6), Cw7,DR3, MB2, MT2, SB4/A1,B8 (Bw6), Cw7,DR3,MB2,MT2,SB-) received a bone marrow transplant from a phenotypically HLA-identical, SB-compatible female unrelated donor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This donor was selected from eighteen HLA-A1,-B8,-blood donors after extended serotyping, mixed leukocyte culture testing and secondary proliferation assays with primed lymphocyte typing reagents specific for SB </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although patient cells proliferated well as responders in MLR, their stimulatory capability was greatly impaired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because the patient had inherited the same serological HLA-D haplotype from each parent, it was concluded that a compatible unrelated donor must be homozygous for the same HLA-D antigens as the patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This HLA-D homozygosity was demonstrated by the lack of MLR responses of both parents to stimulators from the donor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The SB typing results suggested SB compatibility because both the patient and the donor typed as SB4,- </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Following bone marrow transplantation, there was rapid hematopoietic engraftment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patient developed severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> caused by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> of the gastrointestinal tract, which necessitated hyperalimentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>He is currently eighteen months posttransplant with full hematopoietic reconstitution and moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> skin <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
