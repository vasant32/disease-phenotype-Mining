<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Reticulated platelets (RP) were measured with an automated hematology analyzer (modified R-2000) in 287 healthy volunteers and in 212 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In healthy volunteers, the RP was 0.48 +/- 0.26% in men and 0.48 +/- 0.32% in women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No significant difference in the RP values due to gender or age (21-60 years) was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the reverse correlation was observed between platelet counts and RP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The RP was high in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001973'>idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi>), those with high fibrinogen and fibrin degradation products (FDP), and those with high C-reactive protein (CRP), but low in patients after chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The RP was highest in active phase of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi>, and relatively high in the partial remission phase of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In patients after chemotherapy, the patients had a minimum phase of RP and then a maximum phase of RP before <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0836924" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">platelet counts increased</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RP was significantly high in the maximum phase and significantly low in the minimum phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The relationships between platelet count and RP were negatively correlated in patients with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi>, high FDP, or high CRP, but were not correlated in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver disease</z:e>, or after chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results show that RP reflects the pathology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0040034" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombocytopenic disorders</z:e> and the measurement of RP is useful for the differential diagnoses and analysis of platelet kinetics </plain></SENT>
