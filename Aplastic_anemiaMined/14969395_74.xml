<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Microarray assays demonstrated time-dependent increases in expression of 67 genes, including 2 genes for transcription factors that were not previously shown to be expressed during adipogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION Increased numbers of bone marrow adipocytes have been observed in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000939'>osteoporosis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, but the pathological mechanisms remain unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recently, microarray assays for <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNAs</z:chebi> were used to follow adipogenic differentiation of the preadipocytic cell line, 3T3-L1, but adipogenic differentiation has not been examined in primary cells from bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here we defined the sequence of gene expression during the adipogenesis ex vivo of human cells from bone marrow referred to as either mesenchymal stem cells or marrow stromal cells (MSCs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: MSCs were plated at extremely low densities to generate single-cell derived colonies, and adipogenic differentiation of the colonies assayed by accumulation of fat vacuoles, time-lapse photomicroscopy, microarrays, and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS About 30% of the colonies differentiated to adipocytes in 14 days and about 60% in 21 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cell proliferation was inhibited by approximately 50% in adipogenic medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The differentiation occurred primarily at the center of the colonies, and a few adipocytes that formed near the periphery migrated toward the centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RT-PCR assays demonstrated that the differentiation was accompanied by increases in a series of genes previously shown to increase with adipogenic differentiation: peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma, CCAAT enhancer-binding protein alpha, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17984">acylCoA</z:chebi> synthetase, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> lipase, and fatty acid binding protein 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We also followed differentiation with microarray assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Sixty-seven genes increased more than 10-fold at day 1 and 20-fold at day 7, 14, or 21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Many of the genes identified were previously shown to be expressed during adipocytic differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, others, such as zinc finger E-box binding protein and zinc finger protein 145, were not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This study should serve as a basis for future study to clarify the mechanisms of adipocyte differentiation of MSCs </plain></SENT>
