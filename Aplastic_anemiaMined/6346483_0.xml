<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In a review of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> the following points proved to be of crucial importance: (1) combination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (Cy) and total body irradiation (TBI) for conditioning, (2) early BMT for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> (AL) in first remission and for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> granulocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CGL</z:e>) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phase, (3) prophylaxis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GvHD) with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin-A</z:chebi> (CyA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>50 successive BMT for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> performed in Basel between July 1979 and September 1982 are analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>7 of 13 <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemias</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) and 8 of 9 <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphatic leukemias</z:hpo> (ALL) grafted in first remission, and 7 of 10 CGL, are alive without signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and without <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the patients grafted for AL in second remission or later, 3 of 6 AML and 6 of 12 ALL are alive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Severe GvHD was seen in 5 of 43 BMT between HLD identical siblings, in three of them combined with interstitial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus the incidence of these two serious complications of allogeneic BMT has been drastically reduced with CyA compared to our previous experience with prophylactic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> (MTX) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>4 grafts were performed between HLA-haploidentical siblings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>3 of the 4 patients developed fatal GvHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This implies that in this histocompatibility setting CyA alone is not sufficient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No problems were encountered in 3 syngeneic BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>12 leukemic relapses were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Relapse never occurred in ALL in first remission and never in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CGL</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>4 recurrences were seen in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> in first remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> other relapses were in patients with AL grafted in stages other than first remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In 86 successive patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (SAA) the following important advances were made: (1) it was shown that the majority of patients have sufficient hemopoietic stem cells and that after treatment with antilymphocyte globulin (ALG) over 70% have long-lasting remissions, (2) the combined treatment with ALG and high dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> increases the remission rates to 90% and in addition shortens the supportive care period significantly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>These developments are of crucial importance for patients without an HLA-identical sibling, (3) success rates of marrow transplants between HLA-identical siblings could be increased from 36% with prophylactic MTX to 67% using CyA </plain></SENT>
