<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the expression of T cell early activation marker (CD(69)) on peripheral CD(4)(+) and CD(8)(+) lymphocytes and serum levels of soluble <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor receptor 1 and 2 (sTNF-R1 and sTNF-R2) in serum and bone marrow in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) and their pathophysiological significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In vitro activation of T lymphocytes was carried out by whole blood cell culture containing PHA (20 micro g/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The CD(69) expressions on CD(4)(+) and CD(8)(+) lymphocytes at 0 h and 4 h after PHA exposure were analyzed by two-color flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The levels of sTNF-R1 and sTNF-R2 in serum and bone marrow were measured by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The CD(69) expression rates of CD(4)(+) and of CD(8)(+) cells in SAA patients were (8.96 +/- 7.23)% and (10.67 +/- 7.58)%, respectively, and that of CD(8)(+) cells in CAA patients was (7.36 +/- 5.49)% before PHA stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The CD(69) expression rates of CD(4)(+) and of CD(8)(+) cells in SAA patients were (71.73 +/- 11.91)% and (61.74 +/- 13.44)% and in CAA (59.35 +/- 10.15)% and (48.78 +/- 8.25)% respectively, and were significantly elevated after PHA stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CD(69) expression on CD(4)(+) cells was much higher than that on CD(8)(+) cells after stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The levels of the two sTNF-R (sTNF-R1 and sTNF-R2) in peripheral blood and bone marrow of SAA patients were elevated and in the bone marrow of CAA patients were also increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The serum levels of sTNF-R2 were positively related to the CD(69) expression rates of CD(8)(+) cells before PHA stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Increased early activation and activated potentials of T lymphocytes, along with abnormally elevated immunologically active molecules might play a major role in the pathogenesis of AA </plain></SENT>
