<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Within recent years the combination of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> following <z:hpo ids='HP_0006562'>viral hepatitis</z:hpo> has been reported with increasing frequency suggesting the existence of a causal relationship between the two conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two case histories of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> following <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> are presented in detail, and the information on 193 such patients reported in the literature through 1972 is summarized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A number of parameters were evaluated and extensive cross correlation carried out in order to define criteria which might have diagnostic, prognostic or therapeutic value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Males were more likely to develop <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> following <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> (p congruent to 0.05), but females were less likely to survive the marrow <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> (p smaller than 0.025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No other statistically identifiable criteria were detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The hematologic changes commonly encountered in <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> are reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These and other observations support the concept that subclinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> may be responsible for a significant percentage of so-called idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, for which, at present, no etiology can be determined in nearly half the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Possible pathogenetic mechanisms are discussed as they might relate to chromosomal abnormalities which were found in one of our patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that occasional fortuitious human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> with animal viruses known to be both hepato- and myelotoxic could relate the <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
