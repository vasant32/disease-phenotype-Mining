<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To explore the relationship of telomerase <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> component (hTERC) and the telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) with telomerase activity in the marrow hemopoietic stem cells of children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fifty-two children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> AA, 13 children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> AA and 21 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls were enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Telomerase activity and the expression of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> of hTERT and hTERC were detected by Telomeric Repeat Amplification Protocol (TRAP) with silver staining and real-time Q-PCR respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Levels of telomerase activity in both the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> AA groups were higher than in the control group (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The AA groups had significantly higher expression of hTERT <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> than the control group (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> AA group had higher expression of hTERT <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and telomerase activity than the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> AA group (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in the expression of hTERC <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> among the three groups (P=0.812) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a significant correlation between the expression of hTERT <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and telomerase activity (r=0.660, P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Expression of telomerase activity may be involved in the pathophysiology and development of AA, and hTERT plays a crucial role in expression of telomerase activity </plain></SENT>
