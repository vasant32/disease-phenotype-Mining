<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The pathogenesis of SAA is thought to involve autoimmune processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Increased susceptibility to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo> has been shown to be associated with several different HLA alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In SAA, few large studies based on data mainly from adults describe a positive HLA correlation with HLA-DR2 (DRB1*15) and HLA-B14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PROCEDURE: This study explored the HLA constitution of 181 children with SAA who were enrolled in the prospective multi-center study SAA94 between January 1994 and January 2002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The control group consisted of 303 healthy individuals of comparable demographic background </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Allelic frequencies between patients and controls are compared using Fisher's exact test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In our pediatric cohort, we describe a positive association with HLA-B14 (P = 0.0039), but no association of HLA-DR2 with SAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: HLA associations appear to be different in children and adults with SAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This might point towards a difference in pathophysiology between at least part of the children and adults </plain></SENT>
