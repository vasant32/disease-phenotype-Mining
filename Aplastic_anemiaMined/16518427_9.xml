<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Five such patients underwent peripheral blood stem cell transplantation from HLA-identical siblings with a fludarabine-based protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The conditioning consisted of fludarabine 30 mg/m(2)/day x 6 days, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> 60 mg/kg/day x 2 days and horse antithymocyte globulin (ATG) x 4 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two different ATG preparations were used: ATGAM (dose 30 mg/kg/day x 4 days) or Thymogam (dose 40 mg/kg/day x 4 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Engraftment: median time to absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;0.5 x 10(9)/l was 11 days (range: 8-17) and median time to platelet count &gt;20 x 10(9)/l was 11 days (range: 9-17) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At a median follow-up of 171 days (range: 47-389), there has been no graft rejection and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients are in complete remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> GVHD (grade 1) occurred in one patient only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> GVHD developed in two patients (extensive in one and limited in another) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The transplants were performed in non-HEPA filter rooms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In only one patient, systemic antifungal therapy (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="10023">voriconazole</z:chebi>) was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The use of Thymogam brand of ATG for conditioning is being reported for the first time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our experience suggests that this fludarabine-based protocol allows rapid sustained engraftment in high-risk patients without significant immediate toxicity </plain></SENT>
