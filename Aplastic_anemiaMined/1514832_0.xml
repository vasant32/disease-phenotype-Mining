<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Between March 1983 and March 1991, we performed 86 cases of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) for the patients with hemopoietic stem cell disorders: 25 <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>); 15 <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL); 20 <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>); and 26 severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (SAA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ten out of 25 AML are in disease free survival (DFS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were recurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (12), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD (3), <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> (1) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948441" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="VOD">veno-occlusive disease</z:e> (1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nine of 15 ALL are in unmaintained remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirteen out of 20 <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> are in DFS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among 26 SAA, 21 are enjoying DFS, but 1 died of engraftment failure, 3 of graft rejection followed by cytomegalovirus (1) and aspergillus <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> (1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Comparing the survival between standard [less than or equal to CR1: 9/14 (64%)] and high risk [greater than or equal to CR1: 1/11 (9%)] <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, our data suggest that preparative regimen for high risk <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> was not potent enough to eradicate the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e> in advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although our cases are limited and the follow-up period is short, our result of ALL [overall: CCR (60%), standard risk (adult less than or equal to CR1, children less than or equal to CR2; 8/11 (73%) and high risk; 1/4 (25%)] and <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> [overall: 65%, CP; 9/10 (90%), AP; 4/6 (67%), BP; 0/4 (0%)] are optimistic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is of our interest that the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> related with IP (1/33: 3%) and with AGVHD 94/33: 12%) were much less than that of other's observation but the explanation for this still remains to be clear </plain></SENT>
