<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Preparative regimens consisted of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> plus ATG in nine patients, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> plus fludarabine in two patients, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> plus fludarabine plus ATG in two patients </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">Cyclosporine</z:chebi> plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> were given for GVHD prophylaxis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients engrafted on a median of day 21 (range, 15-27) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Grade III-IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD developed in three (23%) of 13 patients and extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD in four (31%) of 12 evaluable patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up duration of 1138 days (range, 118-1553), 10 patients are alive with durable engraftment showing 74.6% (95% confidence interval, 49.5-99.7%) of survival rate </plain></SENT>
