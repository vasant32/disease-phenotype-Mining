<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the levels of CD4+CD25+CD127(low) regulatory T cells (Tregs) and the expression of Foxp3 gene in peripheral blood of children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) and to study their roles in the pathogenesis of AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-one children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> AA, 9 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> AA and 15 healthy children were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The proportion of CD4+CD25+ CD127low Tregs in CD4+ T cells was evaluated by flow cytometric analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The level of Foxp3 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> was ascertained by RT-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The percentage of peripheral blood CD4+T cells and CD4+CD25+ and CD4+CD25+CD127(low) Tregs in CD4+T cells in both the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> AA groups was significantly lower than that in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control group (P&lt;0.05).The <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> AA group had more decreased CD4+ T cells and CD4+CD25+ and CD4+CD25+CD127(low) Tregs percentage compared with the CAA group (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The expression of Foxp3 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in peripheral blood decreased obviously in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> AA group (0.47 + or - 0.08%) compared with that in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control (0.71 + or - 0.12%) and the CAA groups (0.68 + or - 0.14%) (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The low expression of Tregs and Foxp3 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in peripheral blood may be involved in pathogenesis of AA.The more decreased Tregs and Foxp3 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> AA than <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> AA suggests their possible roles in the assessment of the severity of AA </plain></SENT>
