<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe the results of 122 patients reported to the National Marrow Donor Program between 1990 and 2005, who received a second unrelated donor HCT after failing to achieve an absolute neutrophil count of &gt;or=500/microL without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">recurrent disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were transplanted for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (n = 83), <z:mpath ids='MPATH_341'>myelodysplastic disorders</z:mpath> (n = 16), severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (n = 20), and other diseases (n = 3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median age was 29 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four patients received second grafts from a different unrelated donor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among 98 patients who received a second graft from the same donor, 28 received products that were previously collected and cryopreserved for the first transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One-year overall survival (OS) after second transplant was 11%, with 10 patients alive at last follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We observed no differences between patients who received grafts from the same or different donors, or in those who received fresh or cryopreserved product </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The outcomes after a second allogeneic HCT for primary graft failure are dismal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Identifying risk factors for primary graft failure can decrease the incidence of this complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further studies are needed to test whether early recognition and hastened procurement of alternative grafts can improve transplant outcomes for primary graft failure </plain></SENT>
