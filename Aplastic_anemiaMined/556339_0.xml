<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A slight excess of homozygotes for HLA-A was observed (22.2 vs. 14.09%), involving mostly the A2 antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the siblings the patients were more frequently homozygote A2 than by chance (p less than 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The same trends are observed in Fanconi's <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> = out of 18 patients, 7 are HLA-A homozygote (of whom 4 are A2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The hypothesis of the existence of one or several recessive genes involved in hematopoiesis situated close to HLA-A is advanced </plain></SENT>
