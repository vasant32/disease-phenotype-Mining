<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To characterize the persistent abnormalities of hematopoiesis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) after immunosuppression with antilymphocyte globulin (ALG), we analyzed the quantity, phenotype, and growth properties of hematopoietic progenitor cells in 13 patients who received ALG treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometry (FACS) revealed a deficiency of CD34+ cells in bone marrow (BM) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This deficiency was most severe (40-fold) in 4 patients in AA relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 9 patients in remission, CD34+ cells were reduced 2-10-fold and showed no correlation with the ALG-induced improvement of peripheral blood cell counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The proportion of CD34+ cells carrying c-kit receptors was abnormally low (2-10-fold below <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>) in 5 of 13 AA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These patients also displayed low levels of c-kit <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the CD34+ cell population was almost completely depleted of CD34+CD38- early hematopoietic progenitors in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> AA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The proportion of CD34+ cells expressing lineage differentiation antigens CD33, CD71, and CD45RA in AA was increased, as compared to control BM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Formation of hematopoietic colonies by FACS-purified CD34+ cells was nearly absent in 4 relapsed patients, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in 4 of 9, and decreased (up to 10-fold) in 5 of 9 patients in remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The degree of impairment of colony-forming ability by AA progenitors correlated well with the reduction of CD34+ c-kit+ cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The best proliferative response of CD34+ cells was observed in the presence of stem cell factor and, in some cases, fit3 ligand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that the disease process in AA depletes immature BM progenitors, thus providing a plausible explanation for persistent defects in colony-forming ability and long-term regenerative capacity of AA marrow after immunosuppression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the immunophenotypes and the proliferative properties of purified progenitors may be useful for estimating degree of hematopoietic recovery in ALG-treated patients </plain></SENT>
