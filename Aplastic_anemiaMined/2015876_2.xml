<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to test the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> (CyA) in vitro on CFU-GM growth from patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (SAA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For this purpose, bone marrow (BM) cells from 9 SAA patients and 5 healthy individuals were incubated with or without CyA and then cultured for CFU-GM growth in the presence of exogenous recombinant human GM-CSF (30 ng/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SAA patients were tested before or after treatment with CyA, or after treatment with antilymphocyte globulin (ALG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 3 patients responding to CyA, the addition of CyA in vitro enhanced colony growth from 13 +/- 10 to 40 +/- 20/10(5) BM cells (p = 0.01) - the median increment of colony formation was 2.4-fold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 5 ALG responders, CyA produced no increment of CFU-GM growth (from 14 +/- 26 to 15 +/- 16/10(5) BM cells, p = 0.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CyA did not enhance significantly CFU-GM growth in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (from 57 +/- 45 to 58 +/- 81/10(5) BM cells, p = 0.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, it would appear that some patients with SAA can respond to CyA in vivo and in vitro, and ALG responders are not necessarily among these </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This is in keeping with different mechanisms of action of CyA and ALG and possibly with the existence of distinct pathogenetic pathways in SAA </plain></SENT>
