<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report a 12-year-old girl with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> accompanied by chromosome 8 <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> during growth hormone (GH) therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>When she was six years old she was diagnosed as idiopathic isolated GH deficiency, and GH therapy (0.175 mg/kg/week) was initiated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At the age 12, she began to exhibit <z:hpo ids='HP_0000967'>petechiae</z:hpo> in both lower limbs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Platelet count was 11,000/microL; serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> level 11.8 gr/mL; white blood cell count 3,400/microL, with 37% neutrophils, 58% lymphocytes, 4% monocytes and 1% basophils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow examination showed that total nucleated cell count and megakaryocyte were 17,000/microL and 0/microL, respectively, suggesting low formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, 13% of bone marrow cells contained the 3 signals of chromosome 8 marker (<z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>She was diagnosed as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> accompanied with chromosome 8 <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>GH therapy was stopped immediately, and simultaneous administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi> and anti-thymocyte globulin was initiated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Platelet count improved with treatment, and the 3-signal chromosome 8 abnormality disappeared from the bone marrow cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The fact that a hematological adverse effect other than <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> exists in conjunction with GH therapy warrants further investigation into possible hematological changes occurring during or after GH therapy </plain></SENT>
