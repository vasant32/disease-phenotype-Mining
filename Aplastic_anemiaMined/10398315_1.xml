<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="40279">Allopurinol</z:chebi> is known to be a causative agent of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, but there have been few reports of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> PRCA induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40279">allopurinol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We describe here a 15-year-old boy who suffered from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> 6 weeks after initiation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="40279">allopurinol</z:chebi> therapy; his <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> immediately improved after cessation of the drug </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No morphological abnormalities were observed in myeloid series and megakaryocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The prolonged plasma iron disappearance rate and the decreased plasma iron turnover rate also indicated <z:hpo ids='HP_0012133'>erythroid hypoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
