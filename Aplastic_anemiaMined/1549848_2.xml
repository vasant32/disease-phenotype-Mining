<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A positive response in mixed lymphocyte culture (MLC) was also noted in 7 allogeneic recipients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pregraft conditioning included high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (CY) 200 mg/kg over 4 consecutive days, followed by 300 cGy total-body irradiation the day before BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seventeen patients older than 14 years received additional donor buffy-coat cells infusion for 5 days posttransplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A combination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> was used for prophylaxis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seventeen patients were alive with a functional graft, and Kaplan-Meier product limit estimates showed a 80.95% probability of survival at 67.7 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were 4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>: two died of primary graft failure, one from secondary rejection, and the other from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD-related complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> GVHD, grade I was noted in only one patient (5.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD was observed in 10 out of 18 (55.6%) evaluable patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019156" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Venoocclusive liver disease</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006515'>interstitial pneumonitis</z:hpo> were not diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our findings indicate that the combination of CY/TBI/BC is well tolerated and results in a low incidence of graft failure/rejection in multiply transfused Chinese patients who received transplants for SAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The MTX/CsA combination was confirmed as being remarkable in reducing the incidence and severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>For patients with SAA under the age of 40, with an HLA-identical sibling, we highly recommend BMT as the treatment of choice </plain></SENT>
