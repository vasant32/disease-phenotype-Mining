<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The serum Epo level was 72.0 +/- 94.4 mIU/ml (mean +/- SD) in MM patients, which was significantly higher than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects (24.1 +/- 6.1 mIU/ml), but lower than in AA patients (7069.9 +/- 9406 mIU/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A significant inverse correlation was found between the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (Hb) levels and the logarithmic values of serum Epo levels (r = -0.543, p &lt; 0.05) in MM patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This inverse correlation was stronger (r = -0.636, p &lt; 0.05) in MM patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>renal dysfunction</z:hpo> than in whole MM patients, while no correlation was observed in MM patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>renal dysfunction</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that MM patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>renal dysfunction</z:hpo> have a low ability to synthesize Epo and that the supplemental therapy of recombinant Epo is effective to improve their <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, the circadian rhythm of serum Epo level was lower in the morning than in the afternoon in both MM patients and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serum Epo levels after chemotherapy in MM patients were elevated temporarily and then decreased in spite of no change of blood Hb level </plain></SENT>
