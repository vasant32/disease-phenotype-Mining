<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Progression activity in both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> and AA patients was significantly higher than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There was a positive correlation between the activity and the duration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> in AA patients who had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> for less than 100 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The level of insulin like growth factor-I (IGF-I), which is a progression factor for PDGF, was lower in patients, than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that some plasma progression factor(s) for PDGF, other than IGF-I, plays an important role in maintaining the wound healing system of blood vessels in chronically thrombocytopenic patients </plain></SENT>
