<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mean numbers of colonies derived from erythroid and granulocyte-macrophage progenitor cells (BFU-E and CFU-GM) were markedly decreased compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cell-mediated suppression of colony growth as detected by coculture studies was observed in 5 patients; 4 patients for CFU-GM and one for both CFU-GM and BFU-E </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is thus concluded that the pool of hematopoietic stem cells in patients after hematologic recovery is still not fully reconstituted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, this impaired reconstitution appears due in some cases to cell mediated suppression of progenitor colony growth </plain></SENT>
