<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We experienced ten cases of bone marrow harvest and six cases of autologous or allogeneic BMT during the period from June, 1986 to August, 1987 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For autologous BMT cases, bone marrow cells were harvested and cryopreserved at -196 degrees C in liquid nitrogen tank and colony forming assays were examined to ascertain the colony forming ability of harvested bone marrow stem cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recovery of colony forming ability after cryopreservation in colony forming unit in culture and burst forming unit in erythrocyte is about 63 to 73% and well preserved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among 6 cases undergone BMT, five cases are patients with advanced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> including <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo>, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_317'>seminoma</z:mpath>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e>, malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0009277'>brain tumor</z:mp> and these 5 cases have undergone autologous BMT </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Peripheral white blood cells and platelets were recovered to more than 1000/microliters and 5 x 10(4)/microliters, respectively, within 21 days after bone marrow cell infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Disappearance or decrease in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> size was observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases except <z:mp ids='MP_0009277'>brain tumor</z:mp> even though those cases were advanced ones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After autologous BMT, recurrence occurred within three to five months in three cases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
