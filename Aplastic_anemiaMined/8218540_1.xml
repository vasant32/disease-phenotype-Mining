<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Other potential risk factors, including history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious mononucleosis</z:e>, were also evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In an international population-based case-control study, cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0000334'>agranulocytosis</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and controls, who were patients with selected diagnoses, were identified from the same hospitals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Information on drug use was obtained in a structured interview </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Limited information on environmental exposures and on selected items of medical history, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious mononucleosis</z:e>, was also recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The possible effects of these factors on the risk of the two <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">blood dyscrasias</z:e> were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Relative risks were estimated by stratified analysis and by multiple logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among 319 cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0000334'>agranulocytosis</z:mp>, 12 patients (4%) gave a history of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious mononucleosis</z:e> at least 1 year previously; among 2180 controls the corresponding number was 11 (0.5%) (multivariate relative risk estimate, 6.2; 95% confidence interval, 2.3-17) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A nonsignificant elevation in the relative risk was observed for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The data suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious mononucleosis</z:e> may confer a long-term increase in the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0000334'>agranulocytosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, the association was an unexpected one, identified in the course of multiple comparisons, and it must be independently confirmed </plain></SENT>
