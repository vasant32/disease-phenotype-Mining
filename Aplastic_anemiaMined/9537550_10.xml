<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Records of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these patients were reviewed for presenting signs and symptoms, any associated condition, investigative results, management, and follow-up findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall incidence of <z:chebi fb="79" ids="53407">PLA</z:chebi> was 78.9 per 100,000 pediatric (under 12 years) admissions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One patient had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and was on long-term steroid therapy, whereas another had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025007" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">measles</z:e> in recent past </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moderate to severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0004395'>malnutrition</z:hpo> was present in five (27.8%) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0003950" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ascariasis</z:e> in seven (38.9%) children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Common presentations were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> (100%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo> (76.9%), and tender <z:hpo ids='HP_0002240'>hepatomegaly</z:hpo> (83.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ultrasonography results were positive in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients (77.8%) had solitary <z:hpo ids='HP_0100523'>liver abscess</z:hpo>, and four had multiple abscesses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Organism was isolated in 11 cases (63.6%), and Staphylococcus aureus was the commonest isolate (66.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received antibiotics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Twelve cases were managed conservatively with antibiotics alone, of these only two (16.7%) required drainage later on </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Percutaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> was also undertaken in four additional (22.2%) cases and open drainage in two (11.1%), at presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The overall mortality rate was 11.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Time taken for complete resolution ranged from 10 days to 40 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Any child presenting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo>, and tender <z:hpo ids='HP_0002240'>hepatomegaly</z:hpo> should be subjected to ultrasound scan for early detection of <z:chebi fb="79" ids="53407">PLA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>S aureus is the commonest causative agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Enterobacteriaceae contribute significantly during infancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>A combination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49566">cloxacillin</z:chebi> and gentamicin or a third generation cephalosporine and gentamicin, especially in infants, is a satisfactory initial coverage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Therapeutic drainage is not a must in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of <z:chebi fb="79" ids="53407">PLA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>When required, percutaneous needle <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> is safe and effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Resolution and significant reduction in mortality has been made possible by early detection and optimum antibiotics therapy </plain></SENT>
