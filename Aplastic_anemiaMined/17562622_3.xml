<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The conditioning regimen consisted of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (200 mg/kg), antithymocyte globulin (10 mg/kg), and total body irradiation (5 Gy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients received tacrolimus and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> for prophylaxis against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Donorrecipient pairs were mismatched for the HLA-DR antigen in 8 patients by serologic typing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>HLA-A and HLA-B antigens were mismatched in 1 and 2 patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ten patients achieved engraftment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One patient who failed to engraft was rescued by a second transplantation from her mother, who was mismatched at 2 HLA antigens </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Three patients developed limited <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD, and 1 patient developed extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD of the lung </plain></SENT>
