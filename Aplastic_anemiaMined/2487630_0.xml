<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>More and more institutions are initiating bone marrow transplant programs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During the 33-year period between 1955 and 1987, more than 20,000 patients received allogeneic bone marrow transplants; more than 50% of these were performed in the 3 years, 1985-1987 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transplantation is an effective therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo>; in some instances it is the preferred treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo>, severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, and some genetic and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immune deficiency</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005956" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diseases, bone marrow</z:e> transplantation provides the only possibility for cure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow transplantation is associated with serious problems such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GvHD), graft failure, <z:hpo ids='HP_0006515'>interstitial pneumonitis</z:hpo> and, until recently, the requirement for an HLA-identical sibling donor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the past few years, an increasing number of transplants have been performed using HLA-partially matched related or unrelated donors with some success, the level of which is yet to be determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GvHD (8) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006515'>interstitial pneumonitis</z:hpo> (9, 10) can often be predicted by risk factor assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Special precautions can then be taken for patients at high risk of these complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In this report, current data from the International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry were summarized and several risk factors affecting outcome were identified </plain></SENT>
