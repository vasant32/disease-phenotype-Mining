<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Auxiliary liver transplantation offers an alternative method to conventional transplantation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0006554'>acute liver failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is especially challenging for children because lifelong immunosuppression may be avoided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, experience with this procedure is rare and there is controversy about whether to place the graft orthotopically or heterotopically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We present the case of a 3-year-old boy with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006554'>acute liver failure</z:hpo> due to non-ABC <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> complicated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> who underwent auxiliary liver transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Segments 2 and 3 of the graft were implanted heterotopically in the right lower abdomen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Good liver function was immediately restored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>Aplastic anemia</z:hpo> resolved 3 weeks after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunosuppressive therapy was discontinued after 14 months, and the graft was left to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thirty-nine months after transplantation the boy is alive and well with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> liver function tests and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> blood cell counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Heterotopic auxiliary liver transplantation allowed recovery of the native liver in a child with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006554'>acute liver failure</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> due to non-ABC <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
