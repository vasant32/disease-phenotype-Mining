<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>HLA identical, MLC negative sibling donors were found for 31 patients, i.e. 43% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Compared to the healthy population, no significant differences were found in the frequency of HLA antigens and haplotypes in 58 leukemic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two recombinations were recorded, one between the loci HLA-A and HLA-B, and the other one between HLA-B and HLA-D/DR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only 9 persons (2.5%) homozygous for HLA-D antigens were found in the whole series of 353 subjects investigated </plain></SENT>
