<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five G-CSF-mobilized leukapheresis products (mLP) were screened for cellular composition, including CD34+DR-, CD34+DR+ and leukocyte profile, to compare with 5 native (unstimulated) LP (nLP) and 16 BM inoculi </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>G-CSF stimulation led to an increase in CD34+ cells and CD15+ cells but did not influence the lymphocyte content of mLP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two groups of 14 and 16 patients were allografted with phenotypically defined mLP (1-4 mLP were used for each patient) and BM, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>mLP used for allografting had significantly more CD34+ cells, including CD34+DR- cells, monocytes, T cells, and B cells as compared with BM inoculi </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were followed for median observation time of 289 days and 409 days for the mLP (PBPC) and BM groups, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The two groups were well matched in regard to age, sex, and stage of disease, with a slight prevalence of major <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005806" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">blood group incompatibility</z:e> (7 of 14 versus 3 of 16) and a lower donor/recipient weight ratio (0.8+/-0.2 vs 1.5+/-0.6, p = 0.002) in the PBPC group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Granulocyte and platelet recovery was faster in the PBPC group than in the BM group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The time of reaching 20,000/microl platelets but not 500/microl granulocytes correlated with the number of CD34+ cells in each inoculum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The survival curves of the PBPC and BM groups were similar, as was the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GvHD (aGvHD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This was also valid for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> cases (7 and 5 patients in the PBPC and BM group, respectively), who benefited from a high number of CD34+ grafted cells but did not experience aGvHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, mLP do not appear to elicit aGvHD with higher frequency than BM and may be preferable for hematotherapy </plain></SENT>
