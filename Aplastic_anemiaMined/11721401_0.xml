<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: c-kit expression on the bone marrow mononuclear cells(MNC) and CD34 positive cells from 11 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (CAA), 9 severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>(SAA), 10 non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>(<z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>) patients (5 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001891'>iron deficiency anemia</z:hpo> and 5 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001890'>autoimmune hemolytic anemia</z:hpo>) and 5 healthy controls was measured with flow cytometric immunofluorescence assay and anti-CD117 monoclonal antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The CD117 positive rates of MNC in CAA, SAA, <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi> and control groups were (2.08 +/- 1.96)%, (0.89 +/- 0.32)%, (0.67 +/- 0.39)% and (0.45 +/- 0.16)%, respectively, and the rates were significantly higher in CAA and SAA groups than in <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi> and control groups(P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The CD117 and CD34 double positive cells of MNC in CAA, SAA, <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi> and control groups were (0.87 +/- 0.57)%, (0.65 +/- 0.41)%, (0.46 +/- 0.26)% and (0.41 +/- 0.15)%, respectively, and were significantly higher in CAA and SAA groups than in <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi> and control groups (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The CD117 positive cells of CD34 positive cells were also higher in CAA[(71.6 +/- 12.4)%] and SAA[(88.9 +/- 23.5)%] groups than in <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi>[(41.8 +/- 10.3)%] and control [(46.3 +/- 9.7)%] groups (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Hemopoietic stem/precursor cells of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> patients expressed more c-kit receptors than those of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="32918">NAA</z:chebi> patients and healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The hematopoiesis failure occurred in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> is not attributed to low expression of c-kit receptor on the hemopoietic stem/precursor cells </plain></SENT>
