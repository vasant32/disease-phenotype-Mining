<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Survival in pediatric patients has been excellent early after transplantation, but only limited data are available regarding late effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study evaluates late effects among 152 patients followed 1-38 years (median, 21.8 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transplantation-preparative regimes were mostly <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> with or without antithymocyte globulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Survival at 30 years for the acquired AA patients is 82%, and for the Fanconi <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> patients it is 58% (P = .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis demonstrated that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD (P = .02) and Fanconi <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (P = .03) negatively impacted survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two Fanconi patients and 18 acquired AA patients developed a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> that was fatal for 4 </plain></SENT>
