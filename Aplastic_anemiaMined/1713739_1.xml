<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Of 14 patients who underwent allogeneic or syngeneic bone marrow transplantation, 6 had a transient appearance of small blastoid cells in the bone marrow after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most of these patients (11) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, although 3 had severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cells were 8-18 micron in diameter and had scant cytoplasm and dense nuclei with smooth, homogeneous chromatin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They often had distinct nuclear clefts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These cells constituted 4.0-21.3% of the total number of bone marrow cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They were not reactive with peroxidase, alpha-naphtyl butylate esterase, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35682">naphthol</z:chebi> AS-D chloroacetate esterase, or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29149">periodic acid</z:chebi>-Schiff stains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunocytochemical analysis revealed that the small blastoid cells expressed terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase, Ia-like, CD19, and CD10 antigens and cytoplasmic mu heavy chains, indicating a precursor B-<z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CD20 antigen was not expressed on these cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The data suggest that cytoplasmic mu may be expressed earlier than CD20 antigen in the differentiation of B-cell lineage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The morphologic, cytochemical, and immunophenotypic characteristics did not distinguish these nonneoplastic cells distinctly from leukemic lymphoblastic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The increase of small blastoid cells was a transient and self-limited phenomenon, in contrast to that of neoplastic blasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These cells should be recognized as a common component of the bone marrow of marrow transplant recipients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The significance and role of these cells in immune recovery and hematopoiesis remain uncertain </plain></SENT>
