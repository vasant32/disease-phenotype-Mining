<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To characterize changes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> frequency following felbamate withdrawal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Nonrandomized, retrospective chart review of a case series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Epilepsy</z:e> program specializing in adults with uncontrolled <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENT POPULATION: Forty-five ambulatory patients withdrawn from felbamate use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were included if they had received felbamate for at least 1 month, were 18 years or older, had accurate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> frequency documentation, had accurate documentation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">antiepileptic</z:chebi> drugs, and received the same concomitant <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">antiepileptic</z:chebi> drugs before and after felbamate therapy, except for the possible addition of gabapentin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients were excluded if they had hematologic or hepatic toxic effects with felbamate, were unable to withdraw from felbamate treatment, had a progressive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027765" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">neurologic disorder</z:e>, or participated in another drug trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS: When information became available on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0235378,C0348754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Injury or Poisoning" abbrv="">hepatotoxicity</z:e> associated with felbamate, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were advised to taper their felbamate dosage over approximately 2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>They received written instructions for tapering felbamate and adjusting concomitant <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">antiepileptic</z:chebi> drugs and kept calendars to note the number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The charts of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients who received felbamate were evaluated for adherence to inclusion and exclusion criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis was performed using a log-linear model for count data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>Seizure</z:hpo> frequency during the 6 months before initiating felbamate therapy served as the baseline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Changes in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> frequency were evaluated by comparing the number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> in the month felbamate was tapered and the 3 months after felbamate discontinuation with the baseline frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Comparisons were made between patients who started gabapentin therapy and those who did not and between felbamate responders and nonresponders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Felbamate withdrawal resulted in a significant (P=.02) increase in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> frequency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Patients receiving gabapentin had a smaller increase in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> frequency, but the difference was not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>There was no statistically significant difference in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> frequency between felbamate responders and nonresponders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Felbamate withdrawal caused a significant increase in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> frequency over the subsequent 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>These findings are important for clinical trial design and clinical practice </plain></SENT>
