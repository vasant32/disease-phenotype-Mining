<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Marrow failure states are often associated with GPI-negative cell populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Quantification of small clonal populations of GPI-negative cells influences clinical decisions to administer immunosuppressive therapy in marrow failure states (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>) and to monitor <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e> after allogeneic blood or marrow transplantation (BMT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We studied the reliability of high-resolution flow cytometry markers operating at the limits of detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed serial quantification of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> clone size in 38 samples using multiparameter flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Granulocytes, monocytes, and RBCs were gated using forward and side scatter as well as lineage-specific markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The GPI-linked markers fluorescent aerolysin (FLAER), CD55, and CD59 were comparatively evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We also evaluated CD16 on granulocytes and CD14 on monocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity of detection by each marker was further defined by serial dilution experiments on a flow-sorted sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two patients had quantification of their GPI-negative clones before and after allogeneic BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: FLAER was the most discriminant marker and allowed identification of 0.1% of GPI-negative cells despite other markers having superior signal-to-noise characteristics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CD14 and CD16 were inferior to CD55 at lower concentrations and in clinical application </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Multiparameter flow cytometry permits quantification of small GPI-negative clones with a sensitivity limit of about 0.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The single most reliable marker to monitor small granulocyte or monocyte <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> clones is FLAER, especially in conditions such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> or BMT, when traditional GPI-linked surface marker expression can be significantly altered.
