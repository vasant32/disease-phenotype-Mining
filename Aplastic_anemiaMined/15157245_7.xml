<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: This study aimed to establish the prevalence and characteristics of anti-HLA in antibody acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> patients following cessation of antithymocyte globulin therapy and to characterize antibody in terms of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: One hundred and fifty multitransfused, untransplanted patients from eight European centers were investigated by serologic methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixty-two percent were antibody positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eighteen HLA-Class-I-specific antibodies (15 IgG, 3 IgM) were identified in 13 patients; 13 antibodies were specific for HLA-A <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> and 5 for HLA-B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">Epitope</z:chebi> analysis identified significant correlation between serum reactivity and amino acid substitutions associated with HLA-Class-I <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An excess of antibodies to HLA-A1-associated cross-reactive groups was identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in antibody frequency in patients taking <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> compared to those who were not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Data suggested a contribution from B cell memory of alloantigens introduced during pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In some cases, antibody production continued many years after the last transfusion, and although the target varied between individual patients, the antibody to HLA was focused on a few specific Class I <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi>, the majority of which mapped to the HLA-A molecule </plain></SENT>
