<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The patient, a 62-year-old male suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> for 6 years, was admitted in order to undergo laparoscopic cholecystectomy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001082'>cholecystitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Results of laboratory tests at the time of admission revealed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo>: white blood cell count, 1.94 x 10(3)/microl (neutrophil count, 1.23 x 10(3)/microl); red blood cell count, 2.09 x 10(6)/microl; Hb 7.5 g/dl; and platelet count, 3.7 x 10(4)/microl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patient received supportive therapy prior to surgery, including blood transfusion of red blood cells, platelets and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the day of surgery, the white blood cell count increased to 3.93 x 10(3)/microl (neutrophil count, 2.75 x 10(3)/microl) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Surgery ended with no intraoperative complications, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> progressed and persisted postoperatively: the neutrophil count decreased to 180/microl at its lowest and stayed at about 400-600/microl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This suggests the possibility that repeated preoperative administration of G-CSF may lead to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of granulocyte precursor cells and thus cause harm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although the patient fortunately achieved a favorable outcome without severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, this case is a stark reminder of the difficulties involved in perioperative supportive therapy for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
