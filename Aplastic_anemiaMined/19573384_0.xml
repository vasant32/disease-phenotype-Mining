<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data of consecutive 112 children with SAA who had no HLA-matched sibling seen from January 2000 to June 2006 were retrospectively analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients were randomized to receive one of the following IST regimens: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> A (CSA) alone (IST regimen I); CSA and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) [400 mg/(kg x d) x 5 d] (IST regimen II); rabbit anti-T-lymphocyte globulin (R-ATG) [3-5 mg/(kg x d) x 5 d] and CSA (IST regimen III) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No repeated courses of R-ATG were given for nonresponders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients also received stanozolol or <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17272">propionate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The dose of CSA was adjusted to maintain trough drug levels above 100 microg/L and peak drug levels above 300 microg/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall rate of response to IST regimen I was 26.92% and to IST regimen II was 33.33% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The response to IST regimen III (62.5%) was significantly higher (P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The response to IST regimen I and IST regimen II had no significant difference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The 5-year overall survival for IST regimens I, II, and III was 20.50% +/- 15.41%, 39.77% +/- 9.77%, and 66.27% +/- 6.84%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: If patients had no HLA-matched sibling, the combination of R-ATG and CSA remains the best combination for the treatment of children with SAA, providing a survival advantage at 5 years </plain></SENT>
