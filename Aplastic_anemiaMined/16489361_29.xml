<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined risks of graft failure, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> and overall survival after 318 alternative donor transplants between 1988 and 1998 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sixty-six patients received allografts from 1-antigen and 20 from &gt;1-antigen mismatched related donors; 181 from matched and 51 from mismatched unrelated donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Most patients were young, had had multiple red blood cell transfusions and poor performance score at transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We did not observe differences in risks of graft failure and overall mortality by donor type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The probabilities of graft failure at 100 days after 1-antigen mismatched related donor, &gt;1-antigen mismatched related donor, matched unrelated donor and mismatched unrelated donor transplants were 21, 25, 15 and 18%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Corresponding probabilities of overall survival at 5 years were 49, 30, 39 and 36%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although alternative donor transplantation results in long-term survival, mortality rates are high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Poor performance score and older age adversely affect outcomes after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, early referral for transplantation should be encouraged for patients who fail immunosuppressive therapy and have a suitable alternative donor </plain></SENT>
