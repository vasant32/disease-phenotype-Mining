<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="172" ids="27504">MMC</z:chebi>-stress test was conducted on peripheral blood lymphocytes from 29 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ten patients with very high percentage of chromosomal breakage and four patients exhibiting <z:hpo ids='HP_0001442'>somatic mosaicism</z:hpo> were diagnosed as FA on the basis of chromosomal breakage study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Six of these patients exhibited congenital anomalies at presentation while another eight lacked such anomalies or had minor physical problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The present study illustrates that <z:chebi fb="172" ids="27504">MMC</z:chebi> stress test provides an unequivocal means of differentiation between Fanconi <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> and 'idiopathic' <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further, the study, first of its kind from India, stresses on the need for conducting this test in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> cases, even those without congenital anomalies, for accurate and timely diagnosis of Fanconi <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> to implement appropriate therapy </plain></SENT>
