<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It has been well known that Qigong keeping one in a self-controlling condition is a traditional method for promoting human health, prolong life and treating several kinds of diseases refractory to other remedies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) is one of the disease poor responded to conventional therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Qigong was applied to a number of AA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five principle methods of Qigong were practiced as fellows: (1) Regulating respiration consciously to tonify Qi; (2) ameliorating the digestive function on tiptoe; (3) holding one's head for tranquilizing; (4) massaging the loins to nourish the essence; (5) at one's ease to regulate the circulation of Qi and blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Besides according to the various conditions of different patients, some other Qigong methods such as for anti-<z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0004270'>analgesia</z:mp>, <z:chebi fb="40" ids="35498">diuretic</z:chebi>, massage to viscerals etc. were also applied for symptomatic treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In authors' previous work by ABC immune enzymic assay, the authors have shown in most AA patients, their suppressor T cell (Ts) were significantly increased, the helper T cell (Th) dropped resulting in a decreased ratio of Th/Ts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The changes of T-cells subsets were investigated in 10 cases treated by Qigong </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For the patients in Qigong therapy, their Th and the ratio of Th/Ts were greatly elevated than those without Qigong treatment (P less than 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, Ts went down but not significantly in Qigong treating patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Because the change of T cell subsets play an important role in the pathogenesis of AA, the reversion of the change by treating with Qigong may be a promising way for recovery of the AA patients </plain></SENT>
