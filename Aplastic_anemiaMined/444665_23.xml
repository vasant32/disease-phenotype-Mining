<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> lymphocytes in our system increased the number of granulocytic colonies by 31 +/- 6% (mean +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Lymphocytes from 3 of 16 untransfused AA patients significantly inhibited growth in HLA-matched sibling marrows (-30%, -40%, and -37%; p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although these results suggest that the majority of cases of AA are not mediated by a coculture-detectable immunologic mechanism, studies using lymphocytes obtained from AA patients before transfusions may detect the subpopulation whose disease is immune-mediated and who may therefore respond to immunosuppressive therapy </plain></SENT>
