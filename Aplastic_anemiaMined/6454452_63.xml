<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>One-hundred fifty-three recipients of HLA-identical sibling marrow transplants for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancy</z:e> were injected with bacteriophage phi X174 (phage), pneumococcal <z:chebi fb="5" ids="18154">polysaccharide</z:chebi> antigen (PPA), or keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Antibody levels were determined several times in the 6 wk after injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Multiple regression techniques were used to determine what factors played significant roles in the antibody response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The most significant factors were the time elapsed from transplantation, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD), and antithymocyte globulin (ATG) treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had low antibody responses to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> antigens in the first 180 days from transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Beyond 180 days patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD showed antibody responses indistinguishable from those of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD had the following impairments: (1) primary response to phage, (2) conversion from IgM to IgG in secondary response to phage, (3) secondary response to KLH, and (4) response to PPA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>ATG treatment given to patients either prophylactically or therapeutically for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD was followed by lower primary responses to phage in the first 180 days and poor ability to switch from IgM to IgG antibody in the secondary response beyond 180 days postgrafting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Other factors did not yield additional significant information about ability to predict antibody responses including diagnosis, conditioning regimen, treatment in or out of laminar air flow rooms, transplantation, pretransplant refractoriness of the recipient to platelet transfusions from random donors, donor age or donor sex, and steroid administration for treatment for prevention of GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The data indicate that, given enough time after transplantation, the ability to produce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> antibody function recovers except in those patients experiencing <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD </plain></SENT>
