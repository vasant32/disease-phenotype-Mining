<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Medical records of 140 pregnant women with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> in pregnancy and the neonatal outcomes from January 2009 to December 2010 were reviewed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The pregnant women were classified into four groups according to the causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>: gestational <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> (GT; n=94), pregnancy with immune thrombocytopenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000979'>purpura</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi>; n=30), pregnancy with other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematological disease</z:e> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>; n=12), and other causes (n=4): pregnancy induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> syndrome, pregnancy with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo>, and pregnancy with alcoholic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The neonatal outcomes in the four groups were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001622'>premature birth</z:hpo> rates in the GT and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> groups were 11.3% and 16.7%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0001622'>premature birth</z:hpo> rate in the other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematological disease</z:e> group was 53.8%, which was significantly higher than that in the GT (P&lt;0.01) and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> groups (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Congenital passive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001973'>immune thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> was found in 2 neonates (2%) in the GT group and in 4 neonates (13%) in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> group (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, other diseases were also observed in neonates in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> group, including 1 case (3%) of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> and 1 case (3%) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272126" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Evans syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>Intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> occurred in one neonate (8%) in the other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematological disease</z:e> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0409979" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Neonatal lupus</z:e> syndrome was found in 1 case (25%) in the other causes group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>Thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> in pregnancy associated with different causes may result in different neonatal outcomes </plain></SENT>
