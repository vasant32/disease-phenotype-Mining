<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study describes a novel application of HLAMatchmaker to determine platelet compatibility in 16 alloimmunized patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> refractory to random donor platelet transfusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>HLAMatchmaker is a software algorithm that predicts HLA compatibility by identifying immunogenic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> represented by amino acid triplets in antibody-accessible regions of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules and determines the number of triplet mismatches (TMMs) and highly immunogenic triplet mismatches (HIMMs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Corrected count increments (CCIs) and molecular HLA typing were available for 523 transfusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Conventional compatibility assessment based on cross-reactive group (CREG) determination was not predictive of transfusion outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Low HIMMs and TMMs numbers were associated with a higher likelihood of satisfactory (CCIs &gt; or = 8) compared with unsatisfactory (CCIs &lt; 8) outcomes (median HIMMs = 4 vs 6, p2 value &lt; .001; median TMMs = 11 vs 13, p2 value &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although receiver operator characteristic curves revealed that HIMMs or TMMs number are not powerful predictors of individual transfusion outcome, a threshold of at least 3 HIMMs or at least 9 TMMs appeared to be associated with successful transfusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Triplet-matched transfusions were successful, regardless of CREG matching </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data validate HLAMatchmaker for platelet transfusions and demonstrate its potential to refine and expand donor selection for HLA-alloimmunized patients </plain></SENT>
