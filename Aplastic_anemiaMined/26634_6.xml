<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Pre- and post-transplant bone marrow samples from 20 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Morphologic evidence of marrow reconstitution was noted in 18 patients one to three weeks following transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In most instances the engrafted marrow elements in early weeks appeared as small clusters of erythroid or myeloid precursors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow biopsy or clot sections obtained four to eight weeks after transplantation were more cellular with larger clusters of hematopoietic cells, which were most often composed of mixed cellular elements, including megakaryocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two patients with morphologic evidence of engraftment died shortly after transplantation and were excluded from further analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In four of the remaining 16 patients grafts were "rejected" three to eight weeks after transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A fifth patient who received a marrow graft from his identical twin showed a transient increase in marrow cellularity without clinical improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the second marrow transplantation in this patient using the same donor after conditioning with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> resulted in moderate clinical improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In four of the five patients developing graft "rejection" or failure there was an increase in marrow mast cells in pre- and post-transplant marrow samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, only two of 11 patients with successful engraftment had an increase in mast cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although the pathophysiologic role of mast cells in marrow transplantation is unclear, the present study suggests a possible inverse correlation between the numbers of marrow mast cells and the likelihood of successful engraftment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow samples in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft versus host disease</z:e> displayed a slight increase in the number of eosinophils, lymphocytes, and plasma cells </plain></SENT>
