<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Dermal and respiratory exposures to dipropylene <z:chebi fb="10" ids="13643">glycol</z:chebi> monomethyl <z:chebi fb="91" ids="25698">ether</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46788">ethylene glycol monoethyl ether</z:chebi>, and a range of aliphatic, aromatic and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24472">halogenated hydrocarbons</z:chebi> used for offset and ultraviolet cured multicolor printing were documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Evaluation of seven co-workers revealed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> peripheral blood pictures, but bone marrow specimens demonstrated clear patterns of injury in three while the others had nonspecific signs of marrow effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These changes could not be explained by known risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The authors conclude that further evaluation of possible <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bone marrow toxicity</z:e> resulting from exposure to <z:chebi fb="10" ids="13643">glycol</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="11" ids="25698">ethers</z:chebi> and ultraviolet curing printing processes is warranted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>More generally, we have provided data demonstrating that peripheral blood counts may be an insensitive tool for the study of hematologic toxins acting at the bone marrow level </plain></SENT>
