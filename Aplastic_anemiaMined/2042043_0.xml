<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After an initial treatment period of 10 days (600 mg/day), moderate, persisting <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three years later, carbamazepine treatment was resumed at 400 mg/day for 120 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, more severe, irreversible <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> due to bone marrow <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> was diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>History, course, bone marrow findings and the extensive, negative work-up for other causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> strongly indicate that carbamazepine was etiologically responsible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>Aplastic anemia</z:hpo> secondary to carbamazepine treatment is rarely reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Information on the dose and time of exposure are only available from anecdotal case reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Based on a literature survey we analyze the risk of this potentially lethal hematological side-effect and make recommendations for routine blood checks </plain></SENT>
