<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In order to measure platelet-associated IgG (PAIgG), we devised a solid-phase enzyme immunoassay employing a competitive binding of peroxidase-conjugated anti-IgG antiserum between platelets and <z:chebi fb="132" ids="53276">polystyrene</z:chebi> tubes coated with IgG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The amounts of peroxidase bound to the tubes were measured in a spectrophotometer by an enzymatic reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This method is highly sensitive, reproducible and can be carried out more simply. the PAIgG values of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls averaged 21.6 +/- 6.6 (SD) ng/10(7) platelets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>27 (93%) of 29 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001973'>idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi>), who had a platelet count of less than 15 X 10(4)/microliter, had PAIgG values greater than those of controls by 2 SD and averaged 205.5 +/- 323 ng </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a significant inverse correlation between platelet count and PAIgG value of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> patients. the PAIgG values of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> were within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range </plain></SENT>
