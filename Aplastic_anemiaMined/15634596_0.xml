<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the quantitative and functional changes of T helper (Th) cell subsets in the bone marrow of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (SAA) patients and the relationship between these changes and the patients hematopoietic function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: By FACS, the quantity and ratio of Th1 and Th2 cells, the percentage of CD3(+)CD8(+) cells in the bone marrow were detected in 24 patients with SAA at active phase, 15 patients with SAA at recovery phase, and 16 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By radioimmunoassay, the serum levels of TNF-alpha, or IL-4 in 20 SAA patients at active phase, 12 at recovery phase and 16 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The relationships between CD3(+)CD8(+) cells, TNF-alpha and Ret, ANC; and between Th1 cells and CD3(+)CD8(+) cells, TNF-alpha or Ret, ANC; between IL-4, balance of Th1/Th2 and Ret, ANC were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The percentages of Th1 and Th2 cells, and ratio of Th1/Th2 in bone marrow of SAA patients at active phase were (4.87 +/- 2.64)%, (0.41 +/- 0.26)% and 21.22 +/- 5.07, respectively, being higher than those of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls [(0.42 +/- 0.30)% (P &lt; 0.01), (0.24 +/- 0.17)% (P &lt; 0.05) and (1.57 +/- 0.93) (P &lt; 0.01), respectively] and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of them reduced to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels of SAA at recovery phase (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The percentage of CD3(+)CD8(+) cells significantly decreased from (32.32 +/- 8.69)% at active phase to (13.76 +/- 2.96)% at recovery phase (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The serum levels of TNF-alpha and IL-4 at active phase was (4.29 +/- 3.15) microg/L and (1.24 +/- 0.73) microg/L, respectively, being higher than those of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (1.21 +/- 1.16) microg/L, (1.18 +/- 0.97) microg/L, but only the difference of TNF-alpha was statistically significant (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In recovery SAA patients, the serum levels of TNF-alpha significantly decreased to (1.46 +/- 1.41) microg/L (P &lt; 0.01), and the levels of IL-4 increased markedly to (3.05 +/- 1.94) microg/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The CD3(+)CD8(+) cells and TNF-alpha of patients negatively correlated with Ret (P &lt; 0.05; P &lt; 0.05) and ANC (P &lt; 0.05; P &lt; 0.05), Th1 cells correlated with CD3(+)CD8(+) cells and TNF-alpha positively (P &lt; 0.01; P &lt; 0.05), the Ret and ANC negatively (P &lt; 0.01; P &lt; 0.01), IL-4 and the balance of Th1/Th2 positively correlated with Ret and ANC (P &lt; 0.05, P &lt; 0.01; P &lt; 0.01, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> in SAA might be caused not only by the increase of Th1 cells, Th1 type effector cells and cytokines, but also by insufficient compensation of Th2 cells and Th2 type cytokines, which shifted the balance of Th1/Th2 favorable to Th1 </plain></SENT>
