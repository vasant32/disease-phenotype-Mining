<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-23 produced by antigen presenting cells are essential for inducing and sustaining Th1 effector cells via different pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, less is known with regard to the levels of expression and synthesis of these two cytokines in patients with AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This was determined in the current study in 26 patients with AA as well as in 20 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results showed that IL-12 p40, IL-12 p35 and IL-23 p19 gene expression can be detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> samples both from the patients and the controls, using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, an increased expression of IL-12 p40, IL-12 p35 and IL-23 p19 mRNA was observed in bone marrow mononuclear cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients with AA compared with the corresponding one in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Higher levels of IL-12 and IL-23 were also found in BM plasma and PB plasma in patients with AA than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the augmented expression of IL-12 and IL-23 in patients with AA may play an important role in the pathogenesis of this disease </plain></SENT>
