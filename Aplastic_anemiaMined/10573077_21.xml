<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Defects in the HSM associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011974'>myelofibrosis</z:hpo>, or caused by intensive ionizing radiation and chemotherapy generally result in failure of bone marrow (BM) engraftment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Transplantation of donor BM within donor HSM may therefore provide optimal conditions for allogeneic BM transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have transplanted donor hematopoietic cells together with their own HSM to improve acceptance of allogeneic or xenogeneic BM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The non-myeloablative treatment used induced tolerance to murine allografts and provided conditions for the life-long acceptance of allogeneic HSM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Allogeneic BM transplanted within it's own HSM under the kidney capsule caused less <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> than BM transplanted i.v </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Tolerance in mice to xenogeneic (rat) HSM was less complete </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ectopic ossicles were small and contained fewer hematopoietic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, simultaneous transplantation of rat BM and HSM to preconditioned mice improved engraftment of rat BM compared with transplantation of BM alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Donor hematopoietic cells survived longer on their own HSM than on HSM of recipients </plain></SENT>
