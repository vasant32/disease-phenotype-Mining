<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Some cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> showed elevated serum levels of G-CSF and/or GM-CSF, whereas almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of 23 healthy controls showed G-CSF and GM-CSF levels lower than 100 pg/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>High levels of both types of CSF were noted in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0000322'>granulocytosis</z:mp> due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These levels became lower after resolution of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Daily changes in serum CSF levels were also examined in a patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001904'>autoimmune neutropenia</z:hpo>, and it was found that the peripheral neutrophilic granulocyte count changed almost in parallel with the serum G-CSF level but not with GM-CSF, following the pattern with a delay of about 4-5 h, suggesting the possibility that G-CSF mainly regulates peripheral neutrophil circulation </plain></SENT>
