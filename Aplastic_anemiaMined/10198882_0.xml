<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: For more than a century it has been recognized that bacteria may infect the eye by way of the blood stream </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Until fifty years ago, eyes so afflicted nearly always were blinded and a majority of the victims died from overwhelming <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although effective antibiotics are available today the prognosis is still guarded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: A 39-year-old physician died 6 years after he was diagnosed for idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>He had developed pseudomonas aeruginosa <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004610" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bacteremia</z:e> and later a therapy refractive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> caused by aspergillus which had led to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>respiratory failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patient had experienced a marked loss of visual acuity in his left eye ten days before he died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ophthalmic examination at that point displayed signs of <z:mp ids='MP_0003665'>endophthalmitis</z:mp>, hyphaema, and heterochromic irises </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The eyes were obtained postmortem and histologic examination of the left eye displayed numerous bacilli forming cuffs around blood vessels and a sheet between the necrotic <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> pigment epithelium and Bruch's membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammatory response</z:mp> to the bacilli was present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The bacilli could be demonstrated with a Giemsa stain and could also be identified with electron microscopic examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: The histologic results in our patient displayed numerous bacilli without inflammatory reaction which was a result of the aplastic state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Therefore, this disease was classified as "ocular bacteriosis" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The blood-ocular barrier undergoes direct assault with intraocular <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and the impermeability to blood-borne antibiotics is lost </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, with the lack of an inflammatory reaction the permeability to antibiotics may be too low and the achieved concentration insufficient </plain></SENT>
