<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The mechanism by which <z:hpo ids='HP_0004818'>paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>) clones expand is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> clones harbor PIGA mutations and do not synthesize <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24410">glycosylphosphatidylinositol</z:chebi> (GPI), resulting in deficiency of GPI-linked membrane proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>GPI-deficient blood cells often expand in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> who sustain immune-mediated marrow injury putatively induced by cytotoxic cells, hence suggesting that the injury allows <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> clones to expand selectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We previously reported that leukemic K562 cells preferentially survived natural killer (NK) cell-mediated cytotoxicity in vitro when they acquired PIGA mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We herein show that the survival is ascribable to the deficiency of stress-inducible GPI-linked membrane proteins ULBP1 and ULBP2, which activate NK and T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The ULBPs were detected on GPI-expressing but not on GPI-deficient K562 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the presence of antibodies to either the ULBPs or their receptor NKG2D on NK cells, GPI-expressing cells were as less NK sensitive as GPI-deficient cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>NK cells therefore spared ULBP-deficient cells in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The ULBPs were identified only on GPI-expressing blood cells of a proportion of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> but none of healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Granulocytes of the patients partly underwent killing by autologous cytotoxic cells, implying ULBP-associated blood cell injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In this setting, the lack of ULBPs may allow immunoselection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> clones </plain></SENT>
