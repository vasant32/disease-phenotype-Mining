<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The cell cycle status of human erythroid precursors generated in a two-step liquid culture was studied by a double-labeling flow cytometric technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Following a first phase, where peripheral blood mononuclear cells were cultured in the presence of a combination of growth factors, not including erythropoietin (Epo), the cells were washed and recultured in a second phase in the presence of Epo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This procedure resulted in a stimulation of the proliferation and maturation of erythroid precursors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the presence of optimal concentrations of Epo (2 U/mL), a high percentage (&gt; 40%) of cells were found in the S phase of the cell cycle until day 10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Then, as a result of maturation, the proportion of cells in S gradually decreased, reaching less than 2.0% by day 21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At this time, the culture consisted of &gt; 95% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>-containing, nonproliferating, orthochromatic normoblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cell cycle analysis of this normoblast population demonstrated a bimodal distribution; while the majority of the cells had a diploid (2C) DNA content, i.e., cells in G1 (or G0) phase, a sizable fraction was tetraploid (4C) corresponding to cells in G2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, in cultures stimulated with physiological concentrations of Epo (around 50 mU/mL), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the terminally differentiated cells were arrested at the G1 phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that Epo is an essential growth-promoting factor for erythroid precursors, but supraphysiological concentrations, such as present in vivo in severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (e.g., <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>) or after Epo administration, may be associated with development of normoblasts with abnormal DNA content </plain></SENT>
