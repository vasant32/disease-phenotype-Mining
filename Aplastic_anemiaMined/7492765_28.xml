<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We established a sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to measure the concentration of flt3 ligand in plasma or serum from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals, as well as in patients with hematopoietic disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Concentrations of flt3 ligand in plasma or serum from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals were quite low: only 12% (7 of 60) of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals had flt3 ligand levels above 100 pg/mL (the limit of detection) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, 86% (19 of 22) of samples from patients with Fanconi <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> and 100% (eight of eight) of samples from patients with acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> had plasma or serum levels above 100 pg/mL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean plasma or serum concentrations (calculated by assigning a value of 0 pg/mL to any sample reading below the level of detection) were as follows: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteers, 14 pg/mL; patients with Fanconi <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, 1,331 pg/mL; and patients with acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, 460 pg/mL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Concentrations of flt3 ligand in blood are, therefore, specifically elevated to a level that may be physiologically relevant in hematopoietic disorders with a suspected stem cell component </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The elevated flt3 ligand concentrations in these individuals may be part of a compensatory hematopoietic response to boost the level of progenitor cells </plain></SENT>
