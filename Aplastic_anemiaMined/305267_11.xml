<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>B lymphocytes of peripheral blood, spleen, and bone marrow were reduced to 30%-40% and T lymphocytes of thymus, spleen, marrow, and blood were decreased to 20%-70% of control values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>IgG and IgM antibody titer to sheep red blood cells were reduced to one-third of control levels, and splenic IgG, but not IgM, plaque-forming cells were fewer on day 7 after antigen stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The proliferative responses to phytohemagglutinin or concanavalin A were reduced in cultures of peripheral blood lymphocytes, splenic lymphocytes, and thymocytes, and cutaneous <z:mp ids='MP_0002534'>delayed-type hypersensitivity</z:mp> induced by dinitrofluorobenze was not detected in mice with CHMF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results demonstrate disturbance of a variety of cellular and humoral functions and suggest that the disturbance was due to quantitative and possibly qualitative abnormalities of the cell types subserving these functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that residual cell injury, the lesion underlying experimental CHMF, is not confined to the myeloid stem cell but also involved cells of the lymphoid series </plain></SENT>
