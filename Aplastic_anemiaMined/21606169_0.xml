<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Pregnancy in women with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004818'>paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</z:hpo> is rare, with few reports on maternal and fetal mortality rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: A specific questionnaire designed to solicit data on pregnancies in women with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004818'>paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</z:hpo> was sent to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> members of the French Society of Hematology in January 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We identified 27 pregnancies in 22 women at 10 French Society of Hematology centers between 1978 and 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median age was 21.5 years at diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004818'>paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</z:hpo> and 27 years at pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>None of these women had received eculizumab during their pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Maternal complications, consisting mostly of cytopenias requiring transfusions, occurred in 95% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two cases of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (de novo in one case and relapse in the other) were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No thrombotic events occurred during pregnancy, whereas 4 postpartum thromboses (16%) were recorded, 2 of which were fatal (maternal mortality rate 8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Most patients received antithrombotic prophylaxis during pregnancy and postpartum (n=16; 64%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Delivery was preterm in 29% of cases, and birth weight was less than 3 kg in 53% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Fetal mortality rate was 4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Pregnancy during <z:hpo ids='HP_0004818'>paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</z:hpo> is associated with increased maternal and fetal mortality rates (8% and 4%, respectively, in this series) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Maternal mortality is related to postpartum thromboses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Prophylactic anticoagulation is recommended during pregnancy and for six weeks postpartum </plain></SENT>
