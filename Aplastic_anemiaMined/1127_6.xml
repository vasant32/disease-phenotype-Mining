<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Bone-marrow transplantation (BMT) from an unrelated, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-A-phenotype-identical, MLC-negative donor was performed in a 31 year old woman with severe longlasting <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In vitro assays failed to demonstrate humoral or cellular sensitization of the recipient against donor-type antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Following conditioning with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, prompt but only transient engraftment of the transplant occurred accompanied by signs of mild <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host-disease</z:e> (GVHD) of the liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results of a second bone marrow transplantation from the same donor cannot be evaluated due to early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of the recipient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that bone marrow from unrelated, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-A and MLC-identical donors may engraft without severe GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Rejection of the graft in our patient may have been related to greater antigenic differences that can be expected to exist between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-A and MLC-identical unrelated individuals than between <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-A and MLC-identical siblings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, insufficient preparative immunosuppression with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> due to severe hepatic <z:mp ids='MP_0005639'>hemosiderosis</z:mp> appears equally likely as the cause of graft rejection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The possibly increased risk of graft rejection or severe GVHD should not preclude the use of unrelated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-A and MLC-identical marrow donors, when histocompatible sibling donors are not available; but more potent immunosuppressive regimens than the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> protocol may be necessary to ensure permanent engraftment </plain></SENT>
