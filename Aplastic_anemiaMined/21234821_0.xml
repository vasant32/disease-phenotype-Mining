<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The quantities of mDC and pDC and ratios of mDC to pDC in PBMC were measured in 38 SAA patients at active phase, 19 patients at recovery phase, and 17 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The surface expression of CD80, CD86, and CD40 on DCs and B lymphocytes was analyzed in 16 SAA patients and 15 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The percentages of mDC and the ratio of mDC:pDC of SAA patients at active phase increased compared to that of healthy controls [0.65% (range 0.10-2.19%) vs. 0.40% (range 0.11-1.54%), 2.64% (range 1.07-4.33%) vs. 1.56% (range 0.89-2.27), respectively (P &lt; 0.05)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The percentages of mDCs in recovered SAA patients decreased to 0.43% (range 0.06-0.80), and the ratio of mDC:pDC decreased to 1.78% (range 0.49-3.07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The percentages of mDC and pDC in 10 SAA patients were 0.87% (range 0.10-1.85) and 0.35% (range 0.05-0.65) before IST, which decreased to 0.24% (range 0.06-0.52) and 0.14% (range 0.01-0.28) after IST (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The percentages of CD86 expression on DC of SAA patients increased compared to that of healthy controls [29.84% (range 20.28-39.40) vs. 11.97% (range 0.02-24.15), respectively (P &lt; 0.05)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The number of mDCs increased in SAA patients, which was associated with stage of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The increased number of mDCs and the high expression of costimulatory molecules (CD86) on these DCs may contribute to abnormal activation of T lymphocytes in these patients and subsequent immune system-mediated <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
