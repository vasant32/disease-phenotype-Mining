<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The present study was conducted to compare the role of bone marrow aspirate, touch imprint and trephine biopsy to formulate an effective and rapid method for diagnosing wide spectrum of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematological diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study included total 565 cases of bone marrow examination from January 2006 till May 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the smears and sections were reviewed for morphological details and findings on aspirate, imprint and biopsy were compared to each other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The diagnostic accuracy of bone marrow aspirate was 77.5%, imprint cytology 83.7% and that of biopsy was of 99.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The study showed 78% positive correlation between aspirate and biopsy and 84.3% between imprint and biopsy; 93.3% cases of metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> were correctly diagnosed on imprint while only 70% cases were diagnosed on aspirate cytology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The study concludes that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the three preparations of aspirate, imprint and biopsy complement each other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The assessment of iron status by Perl's stain is most suitable on aspirate smears but trephine biopsy remains the gold standard for diagnosing <z:mp ids='MP_0002500'>granulomatous inflammation</z:mp> and hypoplastic/ <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Meticulously prepared imprint smears not only provide cellular composition of marrow but may also be helpful in defining the architecture of marrow especially in cases of metastatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Imprint cytology smears should be standard practice for evaluating any marrow </plain></SENT>
