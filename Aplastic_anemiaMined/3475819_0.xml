<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nine (45%) became LCT positive and refractory to the platelet transfusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This frequency of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948201" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">alloimmunization</z:e> in ANLL patients was significantly lower than that in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> patients (p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In one male with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004836'>acute promyelocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (APL), the LCT antibody disappeared during intensive chemotherapy and recovery of transfused platelets improved remarkably </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three out of 11 LCT negative patients never became alloimmunized with more than 100 units </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These facts indicated that there was no relationship between the number of platelet transfusions given and the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948201" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">alloimmunization</z:e> </plain></SENT>
