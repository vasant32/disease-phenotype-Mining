<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the concentrations of CXCL10, CCL20 and CCL2 in plasma and BM fluid from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA), <z:hpo ids='HP_0004818'>paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) patients by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed to determine <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expressions of those chemokines and their receptors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CCL20 levels in both plasma and BM fluid from AA, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients were significantly higher than those in the corresponding samples from healthy controls; there were no differences in terms of CXCL10 and CCL2 levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Significantly higher expressions of CXCR3 and CCL20 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, meanwhile significantly lower expression of CCR2 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in both peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNCs) and bone marrow MNCs (BMMNCs) from AA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> patients were observed, with no differences in terms of CXCL10, CCL2 and CCR6 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expressions </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our study implicated that CXCL10-CXCR3, CCL20-CCR6 and CCL2-CCR2 interaction might play important roles in Th1 and Th17 (but not for Th2) cells trafficking toward BM in acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> syndromes </plain></SENT>
