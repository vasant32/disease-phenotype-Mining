<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Variations in telomere length have been reported in severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> but their clinical significance is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between telomere length and clinical outcomes in severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Single institution analysis of 183 patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> who were treated in sequential prospective protocols at the National Institutes of Health from 2000 to 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The pretreatment leukocyte age-adjusted telomere length of patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> consecutively enrolled in immunosuppression protocols with antithymocyte globulin plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> for correlation with clinical outcomes were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Hematologic response, relapse, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516669" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">clonal evolution</z:e>, and survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no relationship between hematologic response and telomere length with response rates of 56.5% of 46 patients in the first, 54.3% of 46 in the second, 60% of 45 in the third, and 56.5% of 46 in the fourth quartiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis demonstrated that telomere length was associated with relapse, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516669" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">clonal evolution</z:e>, and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Evaluated as a continuous variable, telomere length inversely correlated with the probability of hematologic relapse (hazard ratio [HR], 0.16; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.03-0.69; P = .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The probability of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516669" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">clonal evolution</z:e> was higher in patients in the first quartile (24.5%; 95% CI, 8.7%-37.5%) than in quartiles 2 through 4 (8.4%; 95% CI, 3.2%-13.3%; P = .009), and evolution to <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 or complex cytogenetics was more common in the first quartile (18.8%; 95% CI, 3.5%-31.6%) [corrected] than in quartiles 2 through 4 (4.5%; 95% CI, 0.5%-8.2%; P = .002) [corrected] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Survival between these 2 groups differed, with 66% (95% CI, 52.9%-82.5%) surviving 6 years in the first quartile compared with 83.8% (95% CI, 77.3%-90.9%) in quartiles 2 through 4 (P = .008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In a cohort of patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> receiving immunosuppressive therapy, telomere length was unrelated to response but was associated with risk of relapse, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516669" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">clonal evolution</z:e>, and overall survival </plain></SENT>
