<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the risk factors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032914" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PEE|PREG1|PEE1">preeclampsia</z:e>(PE) in pregnancies complicated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (CAA) by analyzing the obstetric management and pregnancy outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Retrospectively review the clinical data including the obstetric management, the laboratory findings and the pregnancy outcome of 41 pregnant women complicated with CAA, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of whom were hospitalized in Peking University People's Hospital from May 2002 to February 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Multiple logistic regression was used to explore the risk factors associated with PE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: (1) Twenty-eight patients were diagnosed before conception while 13 were diagnosed during gestation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the 7 who were categorized as severe CAA presented with mild <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> in the third trimester </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>(2) The medians of white blood cell counts, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> concentrations and platelet counts were 5.0×10⁹/L, 66.0 g/L and 12.0×10⁹/L respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>(3) The obstetric management consisted of strict assessment, intensive surveillance and follow-up, appropriate supportive measures, timely recognition of complications, and delivery when necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one patients received supportive transfusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ten patients developed PE, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of whom were diagnosed as severe PE (SPE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients suffered <z:hpo ids='HP_0011891'>postpartum hemorrhage</z:hpo>, and 3 of them had blood loss more than 1000 ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> were conservatively treated in success </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>(4) The median gestational age of delivery was 37 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Sixteen cases delivered before 37 weeks and 5 delivered before 34 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Two patients developed SPE at 29 weeks and 30 weeks respectively, and both of the neonates died for severe asphyxia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The birth weight of the live neonates ranged from 1500 to 3660 g </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>(5) The postpartum follow-up period ranged from 6 months to 7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Thirty-three patients got improvement without dependence on transfusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Four achieved no remission and still needed intermittent transfusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Four were lost in follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>(6) Significant differences were found in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001892'>bleeding tendency</z:hpo>, the platelet counts and the delivery weeks when comparing the patients developing PE and those without PE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>No differences were found with regard to the age, the gestational age of first visit, the percentage of patients diagnosed before conception, the percentage of severe CAA, the choice of treatment, the white blood cell counts and the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The Multiple logistic regression showed that the platelet count less than 10×10⁹/L was an independent risk factor for CAA patients developing PE (P = 0.006) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Most pregnancies complicated with CAA could achieve good maternal and fetal outcome, when intensive prenatal care and supportive management are provided </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>SPE is the most common complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>The platelet count less than 10×10⁹/L is perhaps an independent risk factor for CAA patients developing PE </plain></SENT>
