<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) mobilization, 1-2% of the mononuclear cells in the blood are CD34+ cells, which can be obtained by leukapheresis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed CD34+ progenitor cell transplantation in two children with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (SAA) who lacked HLA-matched donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The donors were treated with G-CSF, 600 micrograms/body/day subcutaneously, for 4-5 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CD34+ cell selection was performed from the apheresis concentrate with mouse anti-CD34 antibody 9C5 and magnet beads coated with sheep anti-mouse IgG1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After the transplantation, the patients received tacrolimus to prevent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>G-CSF was given to both patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A mean number of 4.96 x 10(6) CD34+ cells per kilogram of body weight were transplanted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The hematopoietic recovery after the CD34+ cell transplantation was rapid, except for platelets, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD was less than or equal to grade I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Case 1, who demonstrated mixed chimerism, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> after the graft, received a second transplant with intensified preconditioning, and now sustains complete and stable hematopoiesis after a follow-up of 314 days posttransplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although Case 2 showed early rejection and received a second transplant, sustained engraftment was never achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, the patient's own hematopoiesis appeared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>For SAA patients who do not have HLA-matched donors, this type of approach seems to be a feasible and useful method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, an intensified preconditioning regimen to overcome the high likelihood of rejection should be employed </plain></SENT>
