<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Functional disruption of NBS1 could therefore induce genomic instability and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> have been reported to be heterozygous for a germline and/or somatic missense mutation in NBS1, leading to the I171V substitution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We screened healthy controls and pediatric patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) for the presence of I171V </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the 62 patients, one individual with AA was confirmed to harbor a homozygous I171V mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Genetic analysis of NBS1 in this patient and her healthy parents indicated that she inherited the germline I171V mutation from her father and the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> allele from her mother, and that the second I171V hit occurred on the <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> allele early in embryonic development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, cytogenetic analysis of lymphoblastic cell lines from the patient indicated a remarkable increase in numerical and structural chromosomal aberrations in the absence of clastogens, suggesting that she potentially carried genomic instability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This is the first report of AA with a homozygous I171V mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that NBS1 may play an important role in the pathogenesis of AA </plain></SENT>
