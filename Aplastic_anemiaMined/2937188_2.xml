<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The peripheral blood lymphocytes from 20 patients were studied sequentially in the first 100 days after sibling bone marrow grafting for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancy</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>T and non-T lymphocytes were prepared from peripheral blood by Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifugation and sheep erythrocyte rosetting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>T cells were enriched for T4 or T8 cells and cocultured for six days with pokeweed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi> and autologous non-T or T and non-T cells from unrelated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunoglobulin production was assessed using a reverse hemolytic plaque assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD had failure of non-T cells to secrete immunoglobulin, one had failure of helper T cell activity, and 2 developed suppressor T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similarly, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> six patients studied sequentially after the development of GVHD had non-T-cell failure, five developed helper T cell failure, and five had suppressor T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data suggest no difference in lymphocyte function before or after the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When the T cells of these patients were split into T4 and T8 subpopulations and studied for immunoglobulin production there was helper T cell failure in 4 of 9 tests with enriched T4 populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Five of 9 tests with T8 enriched populations showed suppressor activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Suppressor T cell function was also seen in 4 of 9 tests with with T4-enriched populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These data show that T cell function does not necessarily correlate with the surface phenotype during the first 100 days after grafting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A role for cytomegalovirus (CMV) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> in bringing out suppressor activity is suggested, because among patients without GVHD, 6 of 8 tests in CMV-positive patients showed suppressor cells compared with none of 4 tests in patients without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010823" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">CMV infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
