<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three of four patients in whose serum this protein appeared died soon after; the fourth recovered, and the disappearance of the abnormal alpha 1-antitrypsin paralleled his recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This suggests that the inability to maintain functional activity of alpha 1-antitrypsin predisposes patients to life-threatening complications during recovery from bone-marrow transplants </plain></SENT>
