<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: HLA-matched unrelated cord blood transplantation has been successfully performed for an adult severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A unit of cord blood provided by Guangzhou Cord Blood Bank containing 1.89 x 10(7)/kg mononucleated cells, 1.8 x 10(4)/kg CFU-GM and of CD(34) positive cells was 0.009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient was conditioned with <z:chebi fb="3" ids="3498">CTX</z:chebi> (60 mg/kg) and anti-lymphocyte globulin (ALG, 120 mg/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>GVHD prophylaxis consisted of both MTX and CsA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The CsA had been given for 8 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The lowest ANC was 0.6 x 10(9)/L post-transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patient achieved an ANC of greater than 0.5 x 10(9)/L at 10 days, and the platelet of greater than 50.0 x 10(9)/L at day 20 after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>He developed Grade 1 GVHD in the tenth month after grafting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Microsatellite DNA fingerprinting indicated a stable donor-recipient mixed chimerism, whilst the circulating red cells remained host origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: It is the first report in China on successful treatment of adult severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> by unrelated allo-CBSCT </plain></SENT>
