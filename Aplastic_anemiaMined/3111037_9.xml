<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of transfusion-associated acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> syndrome (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>) was made in 2 patients who developed delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0029118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">opportunistic infections</z:e> and severe cytopenias--56 months for the former (patient 1) and 22 months for the latter, (patient 2) following bone marrow transplantation (BMT) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the third case, grafting for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> (patient 3) (HIV) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> was probably responsible for the failure of hematological and immunological reconstitution 8 months after allogeneic BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Each patient received 6 lymphocyte transfusions from the marrow donor for 3 weeks, combined with a 3-month course of low-dose recombinant alpha interferon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This treatment was followed by recombinant gamma interferon for 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We showed that these 3 patients could resume a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> life for 9 months, at least, and that hematological restoration was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our treatment succeeded in correcting the defect of proliferative response to Candida and the impairment of gamma interferon generation for 4 months in one patient and for more than 12 months in the other two recipients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless T4 lymphocyte levels increased only slightly and HIV can still be isolated from the patients' blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At the time of writing, patients 1 and 3 remain in good health with a partial immunological restoration while patient 2 has died of neurological impairment 2 years after the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e> diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although we cannot generalize this successful therapeutic approach to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AIDS</z:e>, the results may provide an interesting model of the potential effect of lymphocyte transfusions and the role of interferon therapy </plain></SENT>
