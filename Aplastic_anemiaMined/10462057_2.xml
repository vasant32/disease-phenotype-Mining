<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have examined the ability of remoxipride, three <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33135">pyrrolidine</z:chebi> ring metabolites and five aromatic ring metabolites of the parent compound to induce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in HL60 cells and human bone marrow progenitor (HBMP) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cells were treated for 0-24 h with each compound (0-200 microM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>Apoptosis</z:mpath> was assessed by fluorescence microscopy in Hoechst 33342- and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51240">propidium iodide</z:chebi> stained cell samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Results were confirmed by determination of internucleosomal DNA fragmentation using gel electrophoresis for HL60 cell samples and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase assay in HBMP cells </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> was observed in cells treated with NCQ436 but NCQ344 had a biphasic effect in both cell types, inducing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> at lower concentrations and <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> at higher concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data show that the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="18135">catechol</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17594">hydroquinone</z:chebi> metabolites of remoxipride have direct toxic effects in HL60 and HBMP cells, leading to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, while the <z:chebi fb="43" ids="15882">phenol</z:chebi> metabolites were inactive </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We propose that remoxipride and <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> may induce <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> via production of similar reactive metabolites and that the ability of NCQ436 and NCQ344 to induce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in HBMP cells may contribute to the mechanism underlying acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> that has been associated with remoxipride </plain></SENT>
