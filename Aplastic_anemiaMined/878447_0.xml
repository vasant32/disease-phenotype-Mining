<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On the base of the results from the kinetics of iron-59 and the marked with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50076">chromium-51</z:chebi> erythrocytes and from the corrected per cent reticulocytes, the authors set up the task to evaluate the etythropoetic potentialities of bone marrow and the severity of erythrocyte balance disorder, studying the quantity of produced and destroyed erythrocytes daily and comparing the data obtained with those from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> biopsy and treparobiopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results, obtained by the authors, reveal the high potentialities indicated by the isotope investigation with iron-59 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50076">chromium-51</z:chebi> as well as the corrected per cent of reticulocytes, for the evaluation of the erythropoetic potentialities of bone marrow and the high correlation between the results obtained and the clinical picture </plain></SENT>
