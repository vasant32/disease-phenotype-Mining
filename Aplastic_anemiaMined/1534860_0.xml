<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nine of seventeen recipients expressed an elevated percentage of T cells bearing TCR gamma/delta receptors in their peripheral blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seven out of nine cases having elevated gamma/delta positive cells showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> graft-versus-host (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GVH</z:e>) disease; one patient was treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">Cyclosporin A</z:chebi>, and one patient was asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the twelve patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GVH</z:e> or other clinical symptoms, activated T cells (CD3+/HLA-DR+) were elevated indicating an autoreactive or alloreactive cell population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results confirmed earlier in vitro data showing that TCR-gamma/delta-bearing lymphocytes may be an activated T-cell population, and this T cell subset might be involved in mediating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">GVH disease</z:e>, or in prolonging <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> after transplantation </plain></SENT>
