<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Of the 28 children with AA included in this study, 24 were treated routinely and received planned follow-up; 15 were subject to B19-DNA re-examination during the treatment and 8 underwent examination for B19-IgM and B19-IgG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Another 39 initially identified AA children were enrolled as the controls and received the treatment same as the above-mentioned group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were more patients aged 5-8 y in the B19 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> group than the control group (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The course of AA in the B19 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> group was less than 2 mo and the serious <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (SAA) and very serious <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (VSAA) were more frequently observed in this group than the controls (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The overall efficacy of the treatments in the B19 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> group was more dismal than that in the controls (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among 15 patients who were subjected to B19-DNA re-examination, negative findings were found in 6 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (CAA); the B19-DNA was persistently positive in 2 of the SAA and 5 VSAA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>IgM and IgG were respectively detected in 3 and 2 patients out of the 8 children who received antibody examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Parvovirus B19 infection</z:e> contributes to the generation of AA, particularly in children aged 5-8 y </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The AA induced may be mainly classified as serious and very serious type, with a course of disease less than 2 mo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients can be saved if B19-DNA is eliminated and the antibody is produced </plain></SENT>
