<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17698">chloramphenicol</z:chebi> (CAP) remains uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recent observations suggest that metabolites of CAP generated by intestinal bacteria may play an important role in mediating hematotoxicity from the drug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, it is possible that once in circulation and after passage through the liver, some CAP metabolites may gain access to the marrow causing hematotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Based on this possibility, we have studied the stability of CAP and the three cytotoxic analogues dehydrochloramphenicol (DH-CAP), nitrophenylaminopropanedione (NPAP) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35801">nitroso</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17698">chloramphenicol</z:chebi> (NO-CAP) in human blood and liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Determination of these compounds was accomplished by using a high-performance liquid chromatography system uniquely suited for their separation and detection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Several methods for deproteinization were utilized in order to ensure a full quantitative extraction of the drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At zero time, a 100% recovery of CAP, DH-CAP and NPAP was reached with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38472">acetonitrile</z:chebi> (1 vol/3 vol); whereas NO-CAP was slightly or not detectable with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Incubation of CAP and analogues with blood or liver at 37 degrees C for up to 30 min showed the following: CAP was stable in both tissues with full recovery; DH-CAP was stable for 5 min, then gradually decreased reaching 50 or 70% of the initial amount after 30 min of incubation with blood and liver, respectively; NPAP decreased at a faster rate than DH-CAP, and NO-CAP completely disappeared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The data suggest that if and when formed in the body, DH-CAP and NPAP may stay in the circulation long enough to reach the marrow and interact with its cellular components </plain></SENT>
