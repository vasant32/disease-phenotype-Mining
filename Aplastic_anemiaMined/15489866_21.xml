<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among the many kinds of ATG preparations, thymoglobulin had been found to be more effective in preventing GVHD and rejection of organ transplants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As the fludarabine-based conditioning regimens without total body irradiation have been reported to be promising for bone marrow transplantation (BMT) from alternative donors in SAA, thymoglobulin was added to fludarabine and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> conditioning to reduce GVHD and to allow good engraftment in unrelated BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five patients underwent BMT with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (50 mg/kg once daily i.v. on days -9, -8, -7 and -6), fludarabine (30 mg/m2 once daily i.v. on days -5, -4, -3 and -2) and thymoglobulin (2.5 mg/kg once daily i.v. on days -3, -2 and -1) from HLA-matched unrelated donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Complete donor type hematologic recovery was achieved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No serious complication occurred during BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only one patient developed grade I <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD resolved spontaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Except for one who had rupture of <z:hpo ids='HP_0012028'>hepatic adenoma</z:hpo> 78 days after BMT, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the other four patients are still alive with median 566 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fludarabine, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> plus thymoglobulin conditioning allows for the promising results of good engraftment, tolerable toxicity and minimal GVHD </plain></SENT>
