<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: Seven children with newly diagnosed acquired severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (SAA) were treated with a combination of long-term granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and immunosuppression to assess the potential for GM-CSF to induce sustained neutrophil recovery, reduce the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, and enhance the therapeutic efficacy of immunosuppression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Patients received a 14-day course of i.v. antithymocyte globulin 15 mg/kg/day with oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> 1 mg/kg/day, long-term daily oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> A 10 mg/kg/day, and long-term daily s.c </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>GM-CSF 5 micrograms/kg/day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> seven children recovered an absolute neutrophil count of &gt; 1.0 x 10(9)/L within 3.5 months of diagnosis (mean 60 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the six children followed throughout their entire illness (follow-up 10-27 months), five are platelet and red cell transfusion independent (three off-therapy, two on tapering therapy) and one continues on therapy with a diminishing transfusion requirement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared with seven children treated previously with immunosuppression alone, children who received GM-CSF spent fewer days in the hospital and were less likely to develop <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The addition of GM-CSF to immunosuppressive therapy appears to be beneficial in the treatment of children with acquired SAA with GM-CSF stimulating granulopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The children are better protected from infectious complications while <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressive agents</z:chebi> achieve full therapeutic potential </plain></SENT>
