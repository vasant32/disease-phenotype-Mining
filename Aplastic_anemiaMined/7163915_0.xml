<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Thrombopoietic (Tpo) and megakaryocyte-colony stimulating (Meg-CSF) activities were found in urinary extracts from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Preparative biochemical extractions were accomplished using Sephadex G-50 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52153">DEAE</z:chebi>-cellulose column chromatography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The biological activities of these extracts were assessed using not only an in vivo assay but were also examined in vitro employing the clonal development of megakaryocyte colonies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both in vivo, as well as in vitro, biological activities were detected in the batch fraction which was stepwise eluted from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52153">DEAE</z:chebi>-cellulose between 0.022 M <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi> in 0.016 M <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37585">NaH2PO4</z:chebi> and 0.15 M <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26710">NaCl</z:chebi> in 0.05 M <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34683">Na2HPO4</z:chebi> as a single fraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When 0.4 mg of this fraction was injected daily into rats, a marked thrombopoiesis ensued producing an increase of 40% over initial platelet counts by 3 days after administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This was followed by a decrease in platelets to a subnormal range by 21 days after the injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">Hemoglobin</z:chebi> concentration gradually increased from 5% above initial value by day 7 to 20% above initial value by day 21 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The effect of neuraminidase (NAse) on the properties of this extract was also examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>NAse-treated extracts, similar to the native extracts described above retained Tpo activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Changes in megakaryocyte numbers in the spleen and bone marrow of rats were assayed with both the NAse-treated extract as well as with the native extract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A remarkable increase in megakaryocyte numbers, threefold above the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> count, was found in the spleens of rats given the native extract preparation; by contrast, however, no change was observed in splenic megakaryocyte numbers in rats given the NAse-treated extract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, NAse-treated extract retained its ability to stimulate bone marrow megakaryocyte proliferation in the same rat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The urinary extract also revealed in vitro Meg-CSF activity with a specific activity of 31, 750 CFU-Meg colonies/mg of protein </plain></SENT>
