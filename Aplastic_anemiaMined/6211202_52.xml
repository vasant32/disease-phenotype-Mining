<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The relative (percent) and absolute number of OKT4+ cells were severely and persistently depleted for up to 2.7 yr posttransplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the percent and absolute number of OKT8+ cells began to recover within the first 60 days of transplant and subsequently remained at <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or high levels for periods of up to 7.3 yr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in percent or absolute numbers of OKT8+ cells for patients with or without <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The reversal of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> OKT4:OKT8 ratio (2:1) occurred regardless of whether the recipient was given an allogeneic, syngeneic, or autologous transplant and regardless of whether or not <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The reversed ratio was due in the first 3 mo posttransplant to low numbers of OKT4+ cells and later to a combination of low numbers of OKT4+ and high numbers of OKT8+ cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Normalization and then an increase in the number of OKT8+ cells correlated with increasing time posttransplant and not with resolution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD </plain></SENT>
