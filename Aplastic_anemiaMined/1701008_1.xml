<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>RhG-CSF was administered intravenously daily at a dose of 2, 5, 10, or 20 micrograms/kg/day for more than 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the patients whose absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) were more than 0.1 X 10(9)/l, the rhG-CSF injections at greater than or equal to 5 micrograms/kg/day caused rapid and selective elevation of ANC which maintained during the injection period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Most of the patients were well tolerated, and minor side effects were observed in only 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that daily injections of rhG-CSF at a dose of greater than or equal to 5 micrograms/kg/day may be an effective strategy for the treatment of <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> and/or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026946" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fungal infections</z:e> in AA patients </plain></SENT>
