<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The capacity of the hematopoietic system to repair constantly accruing cellular damage under <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo>, low daily dose gamma irradiation is essential for the maintenance of a functional hematopoietic system, and, in turn, long term survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In certain individuals, however, such continuous cycles of damage and repair provide an essential inductive environment for selected types of hematopathologies, e.g., myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (ML) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In our laboratory we have been studying temporal and causal relationships between hematopoietic capacity, associated repair functions, and propensities for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic disease</z:e> in canines under variable levels of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> radiation stress (0.3-26.3 cGy d-1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results indicate that the maximum exposure rate tolerated by the hematopoietic system is highly individual-specific (three major responding subgroups identified) and is based largely on the degree to which repair capacity, and, in turn, hematopoietic restoration, is augmented under <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In low-tolerance individuals (prone to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, subgroup 1), the failure to augment basic repair functions seemingly results in a progressive accumulation of genetic and cellular damage within vital progenitorial marrow compartments (particularly marked within erythroid compartments) that results in loss of reproductive capacity and ultimately in collapse of the hematopoietic system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The high-tolerance individuals (radioaccomodated and either prone- or not prone to ML, subgroup 2 &amp; 3) appear to minimize the accumulating damage effect of daily exposures by extending repair functions, which preserves reproductive integrity and fosters regenerative hematopoietic responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As the strength of the regenerative response manifests the extent of repair augmentation, the relatively strong response of high- tolerance individuals progressing to patent ML suggests an insufficiency of repair quality rather than repair quantity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The kinetics of these repair-mediated, regenerative hematopoietic responses within the major subgroups are under study and should provide useful insights into the nature of hematopoietic accommodation (or its failure) under greatly extended periods of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo>, low-daily-dose ionizing radiation exposure </plain></SENT>
