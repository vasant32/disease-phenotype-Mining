<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: We present a patient with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> who had partial engraftment with full chimerism after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation from an HLA identical sibling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: A 3-year-old girl with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (SAA) received a bone marrow transplantation (BMT) from an HLA identical brother 9 months after her diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Before BMT she was red blood cell tranfusion dependent, had an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of 1,000-1,500 x 10(9)/1 and a platelet count of 15-19,000 x 10(9)/1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>She was conditioned with 800 cGy total body irradiation (TBI) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> and received 3X10(8) nucleated cells/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: She reached an ANC of 1500 x 10(9)/1 on day +35 but her reticulocyte and platelet counts did not recover </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A bone marrow aspirate and biopsy post BMT showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> with marked decrease in megakaryocyte and red blood cell precursors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The granulocyte compartment showed a left shift with predominance of promyelocytes and myelocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The karyotype showed full chimerism (46,XY) with no 46,XX metaphases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This case illustrates the possibility of a bone marrow microenvironment defect as the cause of SAA </plain></SENT>
