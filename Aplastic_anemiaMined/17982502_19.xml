<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The aim was to determine whether outcome of unrelated donor transplantation for severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> has improved in recent years and whether this is due to patient selection or better transplant technology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analyzed 498 patients transplanted during 1990-2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By running univariate regression models dichotomizing year of transplantation we defined 1998 as the year of the most significant change in survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Five-year survival increased from 32+/-8% before 1998 to 57+/-8% after 1998 (P&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When comparing the cohort before (n=149) and after 1998 (n=349), there were no differences except for older age, and more frequent use of PBSCs, after 1998 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>High-resolution HLA typing data were unavailable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After 1998, there was less graft failure (11 vs 26%, P&lt;0.0001), less <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GvHD (cumulative incidence 28 vs 37%, P=0.02) and less <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GvHD (22 vs 38%, P=0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analyses adjusting for differences in age, HLA-mismatch, performance score and time to transplantation, there was no change in the year of transplant effect (relative risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in transplants after 1998: 0.44 (95% confidence interval 0.33-0.59)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There is no evidence for patient selection to explain significantly improved survival in patients transplanted after 1998 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We speculate that this is due to better donor matching </plain></SENT>
