<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hematopoietic response to treatment was moderate and peripheral blood counts (neutrophils, eosinophils, monocytes, reticulocytes) increased only slightly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Unexpectedly, during the time of interleukin-3 administration a substantial bone marrow infiltration by macrophages became detectable, consistent with the diagnosis of medullary <z:mpath ids='MPATH_146,MPATH_652'>histiocytosis</z:mpath>, that may have prevented recovery of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hematopoiesis in this patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This observation may indicate the need for careful use of interleukin-3 in patients with drug-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
