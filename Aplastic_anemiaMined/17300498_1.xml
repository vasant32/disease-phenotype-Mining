<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The outcome of BMT for 17 SAA patients is favorable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eight patients received BMT from human leukocyte antigen matched-related donors (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e>) and nine received BMT from alternative donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The conditioning regimen consisted of 3-Gy TBI and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> of 200 mg/kg in the BMT from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the case of BMT from alternative donor, antithymocyte globulin 10 mg/kg was added to the regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fifteen of 17 patients (88%) engrafted on median of day 18 (range, 11-26) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 13 evaluable patients showed complete donor chimerism by median 30 (range, 13-47) days after BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients have survived with a median follow-up of 67 (range, 2-228) months and the probability of survival was 81.9% (95% CI, 63.3-100%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No late complications including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085183" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">second malignancies</z:e> caused by TBI have been observed and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three female patients have regular menstruation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, TBI of 3 Gy appears to be an appropriate dose regarding to ensure engraftment and avoid the risk of late adverse event for SAA patients </plain></SENT>
