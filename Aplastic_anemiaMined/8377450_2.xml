<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: 42 patients 1-22 years of age suffering from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e>, hematological and oncological diseases, with clinical signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, increased serum CRP (&gt; 1 mg/dl) and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> above 38.5 degrees C and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> (WBC count and/or ANC &lt; 1 x 10(9)/l) were included in this outpatient based study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One important exclusion criterion was poor clinical condition with symptoms of septic shock </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: After <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp>, fungal and <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> cultures had been obtained, single agent broad spectrum <z:chebi fb="2" ids="23066">cephalosporin</z:chebi> treatment was initiated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29007">ceftriaxone</z:chebi> applied once daily in a dose of 80 mg/kg body weight as short infusion over 30 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Daily examinations included WBC, CRP, physical inspection and reassessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In case of persistence or increase of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> and CRP, either outpatient management was carried on with teicoplanin added or patients were hospitalized and switched to combination antibiotic regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 64 febrile episodes in 42 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Single agent once daily broad spectrum <z:chebi fb="2" ids="23066">cephalosporin</z:chebi> was adequate in 43/64 (67%) of infectious episodes in neutropenic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For persisting or increased <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> or CRP elevation, 9 patients were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29007">ceftriaxone</z:chebi> and teicoplanin successfully </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus hospitalized was avoided in 52/64 (81%) of infectious episodes </plain></SENT>
