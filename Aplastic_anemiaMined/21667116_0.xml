<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This retrospective study is to review 24 cases of NE in a single Chinese tertiary center, to elucidate clinical feature, treatments and outcome for this dangerous gastrointestinal complication of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: The medical records of pediatric patients who were diagnosed with neutropenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004387'>enterocolitis</z:hpo> from 2000 to 2009 were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 24 cases, the ratio of male to female was 2:1, the mean age was 7.2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were eight cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, eight cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> non-lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, four cases of non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, one case of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, one case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003006'>neuroblastoma</z:hpo> and two cases of simple <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> without underlying cause </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancy</z:e> was significantly associated with the occurrence of NE (OR = 19.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seventeen cases developed NE during anticancer chemotherapy (chemo group), four cases presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and one case presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> before the initiation of chemotherapy and their presenting event leading to diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two cases simply presented with NE without definitive reasons (no chemo group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients had the typical clinical presentation, six cases had disseminated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002586'>peritonitis</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0600327" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="TSS">toxic shock</z:e>, and assisted ventilations were necessary in three of these six cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CT or ultrasound demonstrated bowel wall thickness, paucity of air in the cecum and/or right colon, pneumatosis or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032320,C0198632" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Therapeutic or Preventive Procedure" abbrv="">pneumoperitoneum</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in the nadir neutrophil count in patients, who received chemotherapy versus those who did not (P = 0.001), but the recovering time from NE in chemo group (9.3 ± 1.9) was shorter than non-chemo group (10.7 ± 5.3, P = 0.034) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Sixteen (88.8%) cases have been successfully managed medically, using aggressive hemodynamic support, bowel rest, and broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy with surgical intervention reversed only for the more severe six cases (25%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Two cases died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: NE is a life-threatening gastrointestinal complication of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Physicians might remain vigilant and consider NE in any neutropenic patient rather than only in oncologic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>It has typical clinical presentation and CT can provide clear delineation for diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Early recognition and progressed management have reduced mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Most children with NE may be treated without surgery with favorable outcome </plain></SENT>
