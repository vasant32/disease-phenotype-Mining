<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>RATIONALE: A discordant relationship between bone marrow cellularity and peripheral blood findings is regularly noticed in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the feasibility of 3-F-18 fluoro-3-deoxy-L-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> (F-18 FLT PET was tested as a noninvasive tool to visualize the total distribution of the hematopoietic bone marrow compartment in AA at presentation or after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In vivo scanning was performed with F-18 FLT PET in AA patients (n = 17), including patients upfront (n = 11) and following treatment (n = 6), in addition to peripheral blood cell counts and a bone marrow biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A striking abnormal F-18 FLT scan was observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients upfront treatment, in particular a reduced uptake of the pelvis was shown, the area that is biopsied for the bone marrow biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Following treatment, the number of solitary lesions with increased proliferative activity outside the pelvis was noticed in patients with partial response, whereas patients with a complete remission showed a homogenous uptake throughout the skeleton </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This pilot study demonstrates that F-18 FLT scan provides a highly distinctive overview of the bone marrow compartment in AA that might be helpful for making a proper diagnosis and monitoring treatment response of AA patients </plain></SENT>
