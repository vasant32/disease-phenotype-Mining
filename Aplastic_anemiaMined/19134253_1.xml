<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: In contrast to severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (SAA), the appropriate management of patients with moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="8" ids="35738">MAA</z:chebi>) is unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, it was reported that when childhood <z:chebi fb="8" ids="35738">MAA</z:chebi> was treated with supportive care alone, 2/3 of patients progressed to SAA, and therefore patients with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="35738">MAA</z:chebi> should be treated with immunosuppressive (IS) therapy in time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study aimed to review the natural history, the rate of progression to SAA and outcome of children with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="35738">MAA</z:chebi> seen at our institution over the past 12 years and to explore the relationship between the effectiveness of IS therapy and the immune mediated pathological mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventy-one <z:chebi fb="8" ids="35738">MAA</z:chebi> patients were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At the first stage, thirty-six children with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="35738">MAA</z:chebi> were given IS therapy (IS group, antithymocyte globulin, ATG or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin-A</z:chebi>, CSA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The therapeutic effects were evaluated and compared with those of 35 children with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="35738">MAA</z:chebi> who received the treatment of supportive care alone (<z:chebi fb="5" ids="50113">androgens</z:chebi>, control group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At the second stage, the patients with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="35738">MAA</z:chebi> progressed to SAA were given combined immunosuppressive (CIS) therapy (CIS group, a combination of ATG, CSA and high-dose immunoglobulin) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets levels were measured with a flow cytometer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At the first stage, in the IS group, the percentage of overall and complete responders was 83.3% and 69.4%, respectively, which was significantly higher than that of the control group (34.3% and 17.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three patients with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="35738">MAA</z:chebi> progressed to SAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the control group, 18 patients with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="35738">MAA</z:chebi> progressed to SAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the IS group, five patients with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="35738">MAA</z:chebi> progressed to SAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The 17 patients with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="35738">MAA</z:chebi> who progressed to SAA were given combined immunosuppressive therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The percentage of overall and complete responders was 70.6% and 41.2%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The level of CD4(+), NK cell ratio decreased but the level of CD8(+) cell increased in <z:chebi fb="8" ids="35738">MAA</z:chebi> children before the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The level of NK and CD4(+) cell was significantly higher in the IS group with the treatment than in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: When childhood <z:chebi fb="8" ids="35738">MAA</z:chebi> is treated with supportive care alone, more than 50% of patients may progress to SAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Immune mediated pathological mechanism of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="35738">MAA</z:chebi> might be the base of IS therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>IS therapy is effective and safe for childhood <z:chebi fb="8" ids="35738">MAA</z:chebi>.CIS therapy given to patients with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="35738">MAA</z:chebi> that was progressed to SAA may also be effective </plain></SENT>
