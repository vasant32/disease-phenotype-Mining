<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Erythropoietin levels varied inversely with the <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> level consistent with the accepted role of erythropoietin in reflecting the adequacy of tissue oxygenation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A particularly step rise in erythropoietin occurred when the <z:chebi fb="34" ids="35143">haemoglobin</z:chebi> concentration fell below 8.0 g/dl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This coincided with the deterioration in clinical symptoms necessitating imminent admission for transfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Change from a regime involving a 5--6 unit transfusion every 6 weeks to that involving a regular 2 unit per 2 weeks transfusion resulted in a lower and more stable pattern of erythropoietin levels and was also associated with a considerable improvement in general well being </plain></SENT>
