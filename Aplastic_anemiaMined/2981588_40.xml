<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) provides effective therapy for many patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, and its mechanism of action has been presumed to be secondary to lymphocytotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, our studies of lymphocyte function in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> show marked abnormalities of lymphokine production, which ATG may modulate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 12 of 17 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, interleukin 2 (IL2) production was markedly elevated in vitro (P less than .01 by paired statistical analysis) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Expression of the IL2 receptor, or Tac antigen, on peripheral lymphocytes assessed by flow microfluorometry was also increased above the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range in 11 of 15 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Studies of ATG suggested that it might act to stimulate lymphocyte function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In vitro, ATG is a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>, as measured by incorporation of 3H-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> into blood mononuclear cells; the response of cells to ATG from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> was exaggerated in comparison with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normals</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cell proliferation was accompanied by production of IL2 to levels that were, in some cases, similar to those obtained with lectin stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, supernatants from lymphocytes cultured in the presence of ATG were able to replace adherent cells in providing growth factors for the support of nonadherent cells in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53448">methylcellulose</z:chebi> hematopoietic colony assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results provide a mechanism for an "immunostimulatory" action of ATG in effecting hematopoietic response in some patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
