<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During the 36-year period between 1955 and 1990, more than 33,000 patients received allogeneic bone marrow transplants; more than 45% of these were performed during the 3 years 1988-1990 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Transplants are effective therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It is widely considered that transplants are the treatment of choice for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo>, those who fail conventional therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> and a variety of genetic, metabolic and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immune deficiency</z:hpo> disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Successful application of bone marrow transplantation is limited by complications such as graft failure, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft versus host disease</z:e> GVHD and interstitial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> and, until recently, the requirement for an HLA-identical sibling donor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the past few years, an increasing number of transplants were performed using unrelated or HLA-partially matched related donors with some success </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Development of post-transplant complications can often be predicted by risk factor assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In this report, current data from the IBMTR are summarized and several risk factors affecting outcome identified </plain></SENT>
