<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is a supposed relation to the immune mechanisms, however few reports have shown the effects of monocytes on the pathogenesis in the patients with AAH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have reported a case of a 12-year-old boy with AAH related to cytomegaloviruses, and studied the hemopoietic progenitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>He showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> of the bone marrow on admission to our hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The culture studies showed that mononuclear cells (MNC) of the bone marrow produced few hemopoietic colonies in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cell lineages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of adherent cells from the MNC increased numbers of erythroid, neutrophil-macrophage and megakaryocyte colonies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the addition of adherent cells of the peripheral blood suppressed the colony formation in the aforementioned cell lineages by marrow MNC from which adherent cells, phagocytic cells and T-cells were abrogated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results way suggest that monocytes play some soles in the pathogenesis of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> through inhibitor of hemopoiesis </plain></SENT>
