<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There were 43 episodes of interstitial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo>, 28 of which were fatal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>About 40% of the cases were idiopathic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CMV was the most common candidate pathogen, present in 47% of affected lungs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By a median of 53 days following transplantation, 46% of the recipients were shedding CMV from some site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This event was three times more frequent among recipients who had positive titers of antibody to CMV before transplantation than among seronegative recipients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Failure to respond werologically to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010823" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">CMV infection</z:e> markedly increased the hazard of dying of interstitial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (rather than <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>) and/or certain factors in the technique of preparation for engraftment may have been significant </plain></SENT>
