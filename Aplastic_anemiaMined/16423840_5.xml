<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The main causes of failure after this procedure are <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft versus host disease</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> and graft failure, often exacerbated by large numbers of transfusions and prolonged disease duration before transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We report the results of allografting following conditioning with fludarabine, alemtuzumab and melphalan in: five patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and one with hypoplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had matched sibling donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Source of hematopoietic stem cell was: bone marrow-2, blood-3, bone marrow and blood-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The age of recipients was 18-26 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four patients received their graft as the first line therapy and two after failure of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> and antithymocyte globulin treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Number of transfused units including red blood cells and platelets before transplantation was 8-100 (median: 22) and 10-32 (median: 11), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> donors and recipients were CMV-seropositive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conditioning consisted of: alemtuzumab 30 mg/d (day -7 to -5), fludarabine 30 mg/m(2) (days -7 to -3) and melphalan 140 mg/m(2) at the day -2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The time to granulocytes and platelets recovery was 15 and 25 days, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients achieved full donor chimerism on day +60 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Only two patients needed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="465284">ganciclovir</z:chebi> as preemptive therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Recurrent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">parvovirus B19 infection</z:e> with pure red cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> B <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> was observed in one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Pure red cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> was successfully treated with immunoglobulins and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> discontinuation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>With a follow-up of 16-39 (median: 29) months <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients are alive, and neither graft failure nor <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft versus host disease</z:e>, or any no other severe complications, was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that transplantation of hematopoietic stem cell using alemtuzumab, fludarabine and melphalan as a conditioning therapy is safe, inexpensive and effective treatment for patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, including multi-transfused adults having their disease for a long time </plain></SENT>
