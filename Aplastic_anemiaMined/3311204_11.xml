<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patient population was heterogenous with respect to diagnosis and disease status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They included individuals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>), <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, and a few other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376544" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematopoietic malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The frequency of various clonogenic precursors in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> donor population varied considerably </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The data yielded a symmetrical distribution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, most bone marrow transplant recipients presented with significantly reduced numbers of clonogenic cells before transplantation, resulting in skewed distribution profiles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serial studies of recipients demonstrated a significantly lower than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> level of clonogenic precursors even 3 and 4 years after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median values and distribution profiles approximated those observed before transplantation but did not return to measurements obtained for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with ALL deviated from this pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The median values and distribution profiles of clonogenic precursors before transplantation approximated the pattern of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The frequency of clonogenic progenitors after transplantation, however, remained significantly lower than that of their respective donor or pretransplant values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Cell cycle studies performed after normalization of peripheral blood hematopoietic parameters demonstrated for most recipients that a higher than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> proportion of multipotent cells was in S-phase (P = .011) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>By univariate and multivariate approaches, clonogenic precursors and clinical parameters were assessed for their contributions to clinical outcome as measured by time to engraftment and survival time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The number of nucleated cells in the transplant inoculum contributed to survival independent of other risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Patients with a higher cell load had a higher probability of surviving than did patients with a lower cell concentration in the transplant inoculum (P = .042) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The frequency of clonogenic precursors in the transplant inoculum altered neither survival nor time to engraftment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The time to engraftment was significantly influenced by the frequency of clonogenic megakaryocyte precursors (CFU-M) observed in recipients prior to transplantation (P = .003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Patients with high values engrafted faster than did patients with a low frequency of CFU-M </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>This was independent of both diagnosis and disease status of the patients at time of transplantation </plain></SENT>
