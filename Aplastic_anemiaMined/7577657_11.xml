<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The relationship of socioeconomic status to the risk of aplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> was evaluated in a case-control study conducted in Bangkok and two rural regions of Thailand (Khonkaen and Songkla) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among 152 cases and 921 controls there were significant trends of increasing risk with decreasing years of education (P = 0.01) and total household income (P = 0.0001), after control for confounding </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The relative risk estimate for those with monthly incomes of &lt; 1500 baht (about $60 U.S.) was 3.9 (95% confidence interval 2.1-7.3) compared to those with monthly incomes of at least 5000 baht (about $200) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The pattern of increasing risk with decreasing income was observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three regions, with significant trends in Bangkok (P = 0.004) and Khonkaen (P = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This finding may partly explain the high incidence of aplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> in Thailand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Low socioeconomic status may be a surrogate for one or more environmental factors that could cause aplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo>, such as infectious pathogens or toxic exposures </plain></SENT>
