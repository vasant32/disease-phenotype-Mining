<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Four children had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000952'>jaundice</z:hpo> whereas 7 of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> were subclinical </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ten children had antecedent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> and 1 had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four patients died of causes unrelated to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> after periods of 2, 4, 8 and 10 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 3 children who were not immunosuppressed at the time of contracting the HBV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> quickly turned negative for <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> B surface antigen (HBsAg), whereas only 2 of 8 patients who were immunosuppressed by chemotherapy eventually became HBsAg-negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The latter 8 patients were also <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two of them quickly cleared HBeAg, but 6 remained HBeAg-positive throughout the follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 6 of 9 patients HBsAg was also detected in saliva </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that children who are receiving anticancer chemotherapy have an increased risk of remaining HBeAg-positive and secreting HBsAg and possibly HBV in their saliva, which makes them particularly infective </plain></SENT>
