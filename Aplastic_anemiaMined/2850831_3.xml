<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006515'>interstitial pneumonitis</z:hpo> (IP) was reviewed in 80 consecutive patients who received allogeneic T lymphocyte-depleted bone marrow transplantation (BMT) for malignant and non-malignant diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Pretransplant conditioning used in malignant disorders included total lymphoid irradiation (TLI) 150 cGy x 4, total body irradiation (TBI) 200 cGy x 6, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (CY) 120 mg/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In non-malignant diseases conditioning included no TBI, but adjusted doses of TLI in addition to CY (severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>) or CY and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi> (severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002875" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">beta-thalassemia major</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the malignant group only one patient developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) grade I; IP developed in 12 out of 61 patients (19.7%) and IP-associated fatality occurred in five patients (8.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cytomegalovirus (CMV) was associated with only two of the five fatal IP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the non-malignant group there was no GVHD; one patient out of 19 (5.2%) had IP, which was fatal and not associated with CMV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that fatal IP may appear in the absence of GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The relatively low incidence of IP-related mortality in recipients of allogeneic T lymphocyte-depleted BMT suggests that although prevention of GVHD and elimination of drugs used for GVHD prevention may reduce the incidence of fatal pulmonary complications, other approaches have to be investigated for complete prevention of IP which still represents a major complication in patients with malignant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521860" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic disorders</z:e> treated by allogeneic BMT </plain></SENT>
