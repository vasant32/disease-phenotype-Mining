<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We recently reported the development of several monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) to native human erythropoietin (Ep) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study we have used the two antibodies with highest affinity to develop a two-sided or sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to measure Ep in human serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this assay Ep is incubated in microtiter wells precoated with the first (IgE) anti-Ep antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Assay wells are then incubated with the second (IgG1) anti-Ep antibody, which is labeled noncovalently with the enzyme alkaline phosphatase (AP) by means of bispecific tetrameric antibody complexes consisting of IgG1 anti-Ep cross-linked to IgG1 anti-AP using rat MoAbs specific for mouse IgG1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Application of this noncovalent labeling procedure, in combination with substrate amplification, results in a detection sensitivity of 0.5 to 1.0 mU/sample (5 to 10 mU/mL), which makes this assay suitable for measuring <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> serum Ep levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The validity of this ELISA for quantitating Ep in biological fluids was demonstrated by the parallelism obtained between pure recombinant Ep dose-response curves and those obtained with plasma and serum from healthy donors and patients with various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521860" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> plasma Ep levels detected with this ELISA ranged from 9 to 101 mU/mL with a mean of 32 +/- 23 (SD) mU/mL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ep levels in sera from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001901'>polycythemia</z:hpo> vera were in the low to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range, whereas Ep levels in sera from patients with secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001901'>polycythemia</z:hpo> and patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> were moderately to strongly elevated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that the Ep-ELISA is a sensitive, reliable, and nonradioactive immunologic method for quantitating Ep levels and should prove useful in a variety of clinical and laboratory settings </plain></SENT>
