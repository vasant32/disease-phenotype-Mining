<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To assess the efficacy of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0012028'>hepatic adenoma</z:hpo> (HA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between July 1989 and June 2006, TACE was performed in seven patients with HA (five male and two female patients; mean age, 25 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The therapeutic results were evaluated by reviewing the clinical records and radiologic studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The causes of HA were hormonal therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (n = 4) and <z:chebi fb="15" ids="28087">glycogen</z:chebi> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0267971" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">storage disease</z:e> type I (n = 2); in one patient, the cause was unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The presenting symptoms were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002027'>abdominal pain</z:hpo> (n = 4) and lower-extremity <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two patients had no symptoms at presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Rupture (n = 1) or impending rupture (n = 3) of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> was detected on computed tomographic (CT) scans obtained before TACE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Clinical results were assessed at subsequent TACE sessions and follow-up CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up duration after the first TACE session was 88 months (range, 16-200 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The change in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> size at CT was measured to evaluate the therapeutic results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The preexisting symptoms were relieved and no procedural-related complications were observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Hemostasis and no further <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> episodes were achieved in patients with rupture or impending rupture with intratumoral <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The treatment results were complete remission (n = 2), <z:mp ids='MP_0010537'>tumor regression</z:mp> in size by more than 50% (n = 4), and progression (n = 1) at follow-up CT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: TACE is a feasible therapeutic modality for HA </plain></SENT>
