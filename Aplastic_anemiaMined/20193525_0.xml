<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twenty-five SAA patients (15 untreated and 10 recovered after immunosuppressive therapy) and 12 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls were enrolled in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Their mature mDCs were induced from their bone marrow monocytes with recombined human interleukin-4 (rhIL-4), recombined human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rhGM-CSF) and recombined human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor (rhTNF) in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Then mDCs were co-cultured with allogeneic lymphocytes (mixture lymphocyte reaction, MLR) at a ratio of 1:100 or 1:50 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The growth rate of lymphocyte was measured with <z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi> thiazolyl tetrazolium (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi>) colorimetry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The concentrations of interleukin (IL)-12 and interferon gamma (IFNgamma) in MLR supernatant were measured with ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The correlation between the growth rate and the concentration of IL-12 or IFNgamma was analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: When mDCs and lymphocytes were co-cultured at the ratio of 1:100, the growth rates of lymphocytes stimulated with mDCs from untreated, recovered SAA patients and controls were (219.8 +/- 94.0)%, (159.1 +/- 66.0)% and (160.1 +/- 91.9)% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The concentrations of IL-12 in MLR supernatant were (8.2 +/- 3.6) ng/L, (6.5 +/- 2.8) ng/L and (6.1 +/- 2.6) ng/L and the concentrations of IFNgamma were (21.8 +/- 8.7) ng/L, (25.5 +/- 9.1) ng/L and (22.6 +/- 7.8) ng/L respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of them had no statistical differences among the three groups (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>When mDCs and lymphocytes were co-cultured at the ratio of 1:50, the growth rate of lymphocytes stimulated with mDCs from untreated patients was (322.1 +/- 171.1)%, which was higher than that of recovered patients [(180.9 +/- 79.1)% and controls (192.3 +/- 91.9)%] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The concentrations of IL-12 in MLR supernatant in the three groups were (12.6 +/- 4.4) ng/L, (9.4 +/- 3.3) ng/L and (8.5 +/- 3.7) ng/L, and the concentrations of IFNgamma were (32.3 +/- 9.2) ng/L, (27.4 +/- 6.5) ng/L and (24.4 +/- 7.4) ng/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Both of the values in untreated cases were higher than those of the recovered cases or controls (P &lt; 0.05), but there were no statistical difference between the recovered and control groups (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The concentration of IL-12 in MLR supernatant correlated positively with the growth rate of lymphocyte (r = 0.529, P &lt; 0.01) and so did the concentration of IFNgamma (r = 0.381, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The function of mDCs to stimulate T lymphocytes proliferation in SAA was enhanced; it might play an important role in the immunopathogenesis of SAA </plain></SENT>
