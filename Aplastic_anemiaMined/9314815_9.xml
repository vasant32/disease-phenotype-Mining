<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: A population-based case-control study was conducted to elucidate the incidence and etiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> in Thailand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Case patients and hospital control patients were enrolled in three regions from 1989 to 1994; data were collected by interview </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-six percent of 81 case patients and 19% of 295 control patients from Khonkaen were grain farmers (estimated relative risk [RR] = 2.7, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.4, 5.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sixteen percent of case patients and 6% of control patients used agricultural pesticides (estimated RR = 2.7, 95% CI = 1.1, 6.6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The association with grain farming remained among those not exposed to pesticides </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In Songkla, 16% of 43 case patients and 2% of 181 control patients were grain farmers (crude RR estimate = 11, 95% CI = 3.4, 35) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The relation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> to grain farming may partly explain the high incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> in Thailand </plain></SENT>
