<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Median survival was significantly longer in <z:chebi fb="8" ids="35738">MAA</z:chebi> than in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and in HAL </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Response to TE was seen in about two thirds of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="35738">MAA</z:chebi> and in a half of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and HAL patients </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that the cytohistological classification of refractory cytopenias identifies essentially two groups with different clinical behaviour, one (<z:chebi fb="8" ids="35738">MAA</z:chebi>, AISA and RA) having long life expectancy and a low probability of developing AL and the other (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>, RAEBtr, CMMoL) with a short survival and relatively frequent leukemic complication </plain></SENT>
