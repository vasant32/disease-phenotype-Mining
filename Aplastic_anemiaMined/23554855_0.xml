<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Previous reports showed that outcome of rabbit antithymocyte globulin (rATG) was not satisfactory as the first-line therapy for severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (SAA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We explored a modifying schedule of administration of rATG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: Outcomes of a cohort of 175 SAA patients, including 51 patients administered with standard protocol (3.55 mg/kg/d for 5 days) and 124 cases with optimized protocol (1.97 mg/kg/d for 9 days) of rATG plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> (CSA), were analyzed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 175 patients, response rates at 3 and 6 months were 36.6% and 56.0%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>51 cases received standard protocol had poor responses at 3 (25.5%) and 6 months (41.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, 124 patients received optimized protocol had better responses at 3 (41.1%, P = 0.14) and 6 (62.1%, P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Higher incidences of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> (57.1% versus 37.9%, P = 0.02) and early mortality (17.9% versus 0.8%, P&lt;0.001) occurred in patients received standard protocol compared with optimized protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 5-year overall survival in favor of the optimized over standard rATG protocol (76.0% versus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>50.3%, P&lt;0.001) was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>By multivariate analysis, optimized protocol (RR = 2.21, P = 0.04), response at 3 months (RR = 10.31, P = 0.03) and shorter interval (&lt;23 days) between diagnosis and initial dose of rATG (RR = 5.35, P = 0.002) were independent favorable predictors of overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Optimized instead of standard rATG protocol in combination with CSA remained efficacious as a first-line immunosuppressive regimen for SAA </plain></SENT>
