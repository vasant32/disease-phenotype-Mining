<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>Hepatitis</z:hpo> C virus (HCV) seropositivity is infrequently observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) patients who have not been extensively transfused </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, HCV seropositivity may not be detected until several weeks or months after <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and AA patients may exhibit <z:hpo ids='HP_0005368'>defective humoral immunity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we evaluated sera from AA patients for the presence of HCV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042749" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">viremia</z:e> using a reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) based assay and several serologic assays for HCV antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum samples from 90 AA patients who presented to the UCLA Medical Center between March 1984 and February 1990 were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall, 17 patients were found to have HCV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042749" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">viremia</z:e> by RT-PCR assay, of whom 14 had a positive second-generation HCV enzyme immunoassay (EIA-2) and only 6 were EIA-1 reactive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The frequency of HCV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042749" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">viremia</z:e> increased with the duration of time between diagnosis and sample procurement, and the number of blood products transfused prior to sampling (P = 0.026) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No patient who received fewer than 20 U of blood products or who was sampled less than 20 days after diagnosis had a positive HCV RT-PCR result </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of four patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo>-associated AA (HAAA), one who was sampled 23 days after diagnosis had <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> C <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042749" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">viremia</z:e> and a reactive EIA-2 assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the high frequency of HCV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042749" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">viremia</z:e> in this patient population is most likely due to transfusion with contaminated blood products prior to the introduction of routine blood donor screening for HCV </plain></SENT>
