<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We began a nonrandomized study in which <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> was not given routinely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fifty-five patients underwent transplant for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> (44 patients), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (6 patients), and other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> (5 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">Methotrexate</z:chebi> was given to 34 patients (MTX +) and was withheld in 21 patients (MTX -) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median (range) age of patients was 12 (0.8-43) years in the MTX + group, and 16 (3-45) years in the MTX- group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean days (+/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) to engraftment (neutrophils greater than 500/microL, and platelets greater than 20,000/microL untransfused) occurred earlier in the MTX- patients (19.6 +/- 1.4 v 24.9 +/- 1.8 days for granulocytes, and 19.3 +/- 1.5 v 27.4 +/- 2.8 days for platelets, P less than .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no statistically significant differences between the patient groups for the incidence or severity of GVHD (10/34 in the MTX + group had grade O-l GVHD compared to 9/21 in the MTX- group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0006515'>interstitial pneumonitis</z:hpo> occurred at a significantly increased rate in patients who received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> (15/34) compared to those patients who did not (3/21) (P = .02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, there was also a significant relationship between the <z:hpo ids='HP_0006515'>interstitial pneumonitis</z:hpo> and the preparative regimen: if the preparative regimen contained 1,000 rad single fraction total body irradiation, 8/14 patients were affected compared to 5/22 patients affected when 1,200 rad fractionated total body irradiation was used (P = .03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Because <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> significantly retards hematopoietic reconstitution, randomized trials for GVHD prevention are recommended </plain></SENT>
