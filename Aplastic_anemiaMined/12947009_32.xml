<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo>, target autoantigens frequently induce not only cellular T-cell responses but also humoral B-cell responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that the presence of antigen-specific autoantibodies could be used as a "surrogate marker" for the identification of target T-cell autoantigens in AA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We screened a human fetal liver library for serologic reactivity against hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell antigens and isolated 32 genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 7 of 18 AA patients, an immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody response was detected to one of the genes, kinectin, which is expressed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> hematopoietic cell lineages tested including CD34+ cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No response to kinectin was detected in healthy volunteers, multiply transfused non-AA patients, or patients with other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">Epitope</z:chebi> mapping of IgG autoantibodies against kinectin revealed that the responses to several of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> were shared by different AA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, CD8+ cytotoxic T cells raised against kinectin-derived <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptides</z:chebi> suppressed the colony formation of granulocyte macrophage colony-forming units (CFU-GMs) in an HLA class I-restricted fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that kinectin may be a candidate autoantigen that is involved in the pathophysiology of AA </plain></SENT>
