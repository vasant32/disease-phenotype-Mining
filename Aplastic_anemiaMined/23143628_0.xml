<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Management of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> is etiology driven, whether constitutional or acquired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Age, gender, and severity of disease also play crucial role in the survival of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since, inadequate data are available from India, the present study was conducted with the aim to evaluate the etiology and survival of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Three hundred patients were enrolled between May 2007 and April 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Severity analysis and chromosomal breakage study was performed and patients were followed up to calculate the survival rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Only 9.4% of the cases demonstrated the evidence of constitutional disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277564" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">acquired disease</z:e> showed a significantly higher odd ratio for <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall survival was found to be independent of the gender and inherited etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Phenotype resembling to constitutional disease was present in only 22.22% (6/27) of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Similar ratio of the constitutional and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277564" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">acquired disease</z:e> in both the age groups was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Irrespective of the age and phenotype, chromosomal breakage study should be mandatory for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>Hepatitis</z:hpo> as a preceding event may be associated with the cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Young age and less severe disease were strongly associated with better survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Lack of tertiary care facility in the country, time lag between diagnosis and treatment, and unaffordability to abide the treatment cost could be the major contributory factors for poorer survival </plain></SENT>
