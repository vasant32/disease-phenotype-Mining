<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report an original case of a 59-year-old patient who developed a moderate aplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> while he was treated for a biopsy-proven eosinophilic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100537'>fasciitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A complete set of investigations was carried out and was found to be negative, including a first research of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004818'>paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We discuss a potential link between the two conditions and hypothesize that <z:hpo ids='HP_0004818'>paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</z:hpo> blood cells may pre-exist for a long time and take a survival advantage in the setting of marrow injury, as observed in eosinophilic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100537'>fasciitis</z:hpo> with hematological complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We finally suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0004818'>paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</z:hpo> should be included as a hematological complication of eosinophilic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100537'>fasciitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
