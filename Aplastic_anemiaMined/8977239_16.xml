<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In the past, the analysis of primitive human hematopoietic progenitor cells with repopulating activity was limited by lack of appropriate in vitro assay systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It was recently shown that cobblestone area-forming cells (CAFC) giving rise to cobblestone areas after 5 weeks in long-term marrow cultures (LTMC) represent a population of pluripotent progenitor cells with long-term marrow-repopulating activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have used a microtiter limiting dilution-type human LTMC system to quantitate the frequency of CAFC (week 5) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In bone marrow mononuclear cells (BM-MNC) of healthy donors (n = 36) we observed a mean frequency of 84.4 CAFC per 10(5) BM-MNC (95% confidence interval limits, 66.4 to 102.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean frequency of CAFC in BM of 31 AA patients was 6.6 per 10(5) BM-MNC (95% confidence interval limits, 5.3 to 7.9; n = 47) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This frequency is significantly lower as compared with controls (P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The frequency of CAFC was reduced not only in pancytopenic AA patients (6.2 per 10(5) BM-MNC; P &lt; .0001 v control), but also in patients in remission after immunosuppression (7.6; P &lt; .0001 v control; P = .1 v pancytopenic AA patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The CAFC frequency did not correlate with the severity or duration of the disease and did not predict response to immunosuppressive treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In summary, the frequency of primitive hematopoietic progenitor cells, as measured by the CAFC assay, is significantly reduced in AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CAFC remain severely reduced even after hematologic recovery after immunosuppressive treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The low frequency of CAFC in remission patients is in keeping with other data pointing to a persisting defect of hematopoiesis in patients in remission after immunosuppressive treatment </plain></SENT>
