<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is important to determine the cause of hepatic injury to institute appropriate therapy; however, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> may prevent performance of hepatic biopsy to establish a cause </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: We prospectively evaluated the cause of hepatic dysfunction using laparoscopic biopsy of the liver in 20 consecutive patients who were receiving intensive cytotoxic therapy, with or without bone marrow transplantation, or who were being treated for severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One to three direct-vision laparoscopic biopsies were performed in each patient during general anesthesia and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> was controlled with spatula electrocautery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Platelet concentrate transfusions were given before, during, and immediately after the biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Platelet and leukocyte counts at the time of hepatic biopsy ranged from 1,000 to 83,000 per microL (median of 23,500 per microL) and zero to 14,300 per microL (median of 2,200 per microL), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nineteen of 20 patients had platelet counts of less than 68,000 per microL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>Bleeding</z:mp> at biopsy site was controlled during the procedure without evidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> or complications after biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Biopsy specimens revealed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (n = 2), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019156" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hepatic veno-occlusive disease</z:e> (n = 1), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001397'>steatosis</z:hpo> (n = 5), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001396'>cholestasis</z:hpo> (n = 19), <z:mp ids='MP_0005639'>hemosiderosis</z:mp> (n = 19), and granuloma (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In several patients, the knowledge derived from hepatic biopsy results altered the therapeutic strategy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The use of laparoscopic hepatic biopsy to assess the cause of hepatic dysfunction should be encouraged because it is a safe procedure, even in patients who are severely thrombocytopenic and immunocompromised </plain></SENT>
