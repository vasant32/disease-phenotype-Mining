<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AIMS: This study evaluated the feasibility, safety and immunological effects of the intravenous administration of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) from a related donor in patients with refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A mean of 6 × 10(5)/kg (range, 5.0-7.1 × 10(5)) MSCs were injected intravenously to 18 patients, including 14 patients with nonsevere AA and four patients with severe AA who were refractory to prior immunosuppressive treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The outcomes of patients treated with MSCs were evaluated and compared with a historic control cohort, including 18 patients with refractory AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two patients had injection-related adverse events, including transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No major adverse events were reported during the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An immunological analysis revealed an increased proportion of CD4(+)CD25(+) FOXP3(+)regulatory T cells in peripheral mononuclear cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Following up for 1 year, six of 18 patients (33.3%) achieved a complete response or a partial response to MSC treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In six patients, two achieved a complete response including a recovery of three hematopoietic cell lines after MSCs therapy at days 88 and 92, two patients achieved only a red cell recovery with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> levels &gt;100 g/L at days 30 and 48 and two patients had only a platelet recovery with a platelet count of &gt;60 × 10(9)/L at days 54 and 81 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the control cohort, only one patient (5.56%) achieved a partial response during the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The data from the present study suggest that treatment with MSCs from a related donor may be a promising therapeutic strategy for patients with refractory AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The trial has been registered at ClinicalTrials.gov: identifier NCT01305694 </plain></SENT>
