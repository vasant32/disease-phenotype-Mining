<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To identify novel autoantibodies in acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA), we screened the sera of patients with AA possessing small populations of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004818'>paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>)-type cells for the presence of antibodies (Abs) which recognize proteins derived from a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cell line, UT-7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Immunoblotting using proteins derived from lysates or culture supernatants of UT-7 cells revealed the presence of IgG Abs specific to an 80-kDa protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">Peptide</z:chebi> mass fingerprinting identified this 80-kDa protein as moesin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using recombinant moesin showed high titers of antimoesin Abs in 25 (37%) of 67 patients with AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moesin was secreted from several myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cell lines other than UT-7, such as OUN-1 and K562, as an exosomal protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The presence of antimoesin Abs was significantly correlated with the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>-type cells and antidiazepam-binding inhibitor-related protein-1 (DRS-1) Abs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with AA that did not show any of these 3 markers tended to respond poorly to immunosuppressive therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that a B-cell response to moesin, possibly derived from hematopoietic cells, frequently occurs in patients with AA and that detection of antimoesin Abs in combination with other markers may be useful in diagnosing immune pathophysiology in patients with AA </plain></SENT>
