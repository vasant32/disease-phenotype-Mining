<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Twelve patients with severe AA (SAA) and 4 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> AA (CAA) received allo- HSCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The effectiveness and complication were analyzed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Hematopoiesis reconstitution was achieved 14 patients (87.50%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median time of neutrophils reached to 0.5 x 10(9)/L and platelets reached to 20 x 10(9)/L were 14 (11 - 16) and 14 (10 - 33) days, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six cases developed grade I - II <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (aGVHD), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> local GVHD occurred in 2 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Graft rejection occurred in 3 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thirteen cases survived with a median of 10 (0.5 - 84) months at the end of follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three cases died of un-engraftment, graft rejection (GR) and interstitial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> (IP) each </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Allo-HSCT is an effective therapy for patients with AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Enhancing immunosuppressive treatment for conditioning and GVHD prophylaxis may reduce the incidence of GR and GVHD </plain></SENT>
