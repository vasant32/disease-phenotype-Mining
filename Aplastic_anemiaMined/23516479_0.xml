<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report identification of a new small molecule activator, GRN510, with activity ex vivo and in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using a novel mouse model, we tested the potential of GRN510 to limit <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> induced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3139">bleomycin</z:chebi> in mTERT heterozygous mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Treatment with GRN510 at 10 mg/kg/day activated telomerase 2-4 fold both in hematopoietic progenitors ex vivo and in bone marrow and lung tissue in vivo, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Telomerase activation was countered by co-treatment with Imetelstat (GRN163L), a potent telomerase inhibitor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this model of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3139">bleomycin</z:chebi>-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp>, treatment with GRN510 suppressed the development of <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> and accumulation of senescent cells in the lung via a mechanism dependent upon telomerase activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Treatment of small airway epithelial cells (SAEC) or lung fibroblasts ex vivo with GRN510 revealed telomerase activating and replicative lifespan promoting effects only in the SAEC, suggesting that the mechanism accounting for the protective effects of GRN510 against induced <z:mp ids='MP_0006050'>lung fibrosis</z:mp> involves specific types of lung cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Together, these results support the use of small molecule activators of telomerase in therapies to treat idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002206'>pulmonary fibrosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
