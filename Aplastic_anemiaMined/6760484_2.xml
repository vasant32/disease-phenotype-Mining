<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We previously studied the post-transplantation sera of 20 consecutive patients using the <z:chebi fb="74" ids="28073">chromium</z:chebi> release assays of complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and/or antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Reactivity against peripheral blood mononuclear cells of the marrow donors was found which was associated with graft rejection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sera of 17 consecutive patients who rejected their grafts have now been studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Donor cells susceptible to cytotoxicity in both the CDC and ADCC assays were composed of both adherent and nonadherent cells not forming spontaneous rosettes with sheep red blood cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Absorption studies demonstrated that the reactivities were mediated by antibody, and inhibition studies with 2-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="41218">mercaptoethanol</z:chebi> indicated that the active component was IgM </plain></SENT>
