<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To report a case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001919'>acute renal failure</z:hpo> in a patient with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> after administration of antithymocyte globulin (ATG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CASE SUMMARY: A 41-year-old man diagnosed with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> was treated with ATG and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After one dose of ATG (3012 mg, 40 mg/kg), the patient developed anuric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001919'>acute renal failure</z:hpo>, with serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> 3.4 mg/dL (1.2 mg/dL at baseline) and blood <z:chebi fb="20" ids="16199">urea</z:chebi> nitrogen (BUN) 29 mg/dL (13 mg/dL at baseline), which required intermittent hemodialysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>Renal failure</z:hpo> resolved with cessation of the drug, serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> and BUN returned to baseline levels, and the patient no longer required hemodialysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: ATG is a purified and concentrated gamma globulin, primarily a monomeric immunoglobulin G from hyperimmune serum of horses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is widely used to treat severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and to manage <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> transplant rejection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This patient had no other confounding factors for the cause of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An objective causality assessment using the Naranjo probability scale suggested that ATG was the probable cause of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001919'>acute renal failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0268731" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">glomerular disease</z:e> was not excluded, as a renal biopsy was not performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The association between renal injury and administration of ATG remains unclear; therefore, we recommend that renal function be assessed and carefully monitored prior to and after administration of ATG </plain></SENT>
