<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In 11 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001889'>megaloblastic anemia</z:hpo>, transfusion of packed erythrocytes or washed erythrocytes invariably resulted in a decline in plasma iron concentration to a range of 20-90 microgram/dl (3.6-16 mumol/l) after 36 to 48 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The same phenomenon was observed in two of six cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010972'>ineffective erythropoiesis</z:hpo> without megaloblastosis and in none of five cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The observed changes did not result from a specific hematinic response or from iron uptake by a non-erythroid compartment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0001889'>megaloblastic anemia</z:hpo>, alteration in marrow function in response to transfusion was reflected by plasma iron kinetics and serum <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase values, which indicated marked reductions in both marrow <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0010972'>ineffective erythropoiesis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transfusion in megalobastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> was also responsible for a 50% reduction in platelet count after 2 to 6 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The significance of these changes is discussed </plain></SENT>
