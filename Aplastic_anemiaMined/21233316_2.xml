<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The conditioning regimen consisted of 125 mg/m² fludarabine, 80 mg/m² melphalan, and 4 Gy of total body irradiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The median infused total nucleated cell number and CD34(+) cell number were 2.50 × 10⁷/kg and 0.76 × 10⁵/kg, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eleven of the 12 patients achieved primary neutrophil and platelet engraftment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients who achieved engraftment had complete hematologic recovery with complete donor chimerism, except for one patient who developed late graft failure 3 years after RI-UCBT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two of the 12 patients died of idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> syndrome, and the remaining 10 patients are alive, having survived for a median of 36 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our encouraging results indicate that RI-UCBT may become a viable therapeutic option for adult severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> patients who lack suitable human leukocyte antigen-matched donors and fail immunosuppressive therapy </plain></SENT>
