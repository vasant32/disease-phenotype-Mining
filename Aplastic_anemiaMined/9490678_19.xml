<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated the hematopoietic reservoir in 43 severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (SAA) patients following immunosuppression (IS) (n = 15) or bone marrow transplantation (BMT) (n = 28), at a median interval of 5 years (range, 2-20) from treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> blood counts, good marrow cellularity, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> numbers of colony forming unit-granulocyte macrophages (CFU-GM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Burst forming unit-erythroid (BFU-E) and colony forming unit-granulocyte erythroid megakaryocyte macrophages (CFU-GEMM) numbers were reduced when compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the most pronounced defect was observed at the level of long-term culture-initiating cells (LTC-IC), which significantly differed from controls (P &lt; .00001) both for IS and BMT patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Their number did not improve with time and was not affected by transplant or treatment-related variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When IS patients were compared with BMT we found comparable numbers of CFU-GEMM (P = .8) and LTC-IC (P = .9), but lower numbers of BFU-E and CFU-GM (P = .05 and P = .004, respectively), suggestive of a persistent suppressive mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that LTC-IC numbers are severely reduced in BMT and IS patients, contradicting the common belief that the former are fully reconstituted as compared with the latter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, the number of mature cells and committed progenitors does not seem to reflect the real size of the hematopoietic reservoir and few stem cells may be sufficient to guarantee <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hematopoiesis long term </plain></SENT>
