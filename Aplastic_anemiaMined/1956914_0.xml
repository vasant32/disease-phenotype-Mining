<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This should be done within the first few days after exposure to determine whether or not a spontaneous recovery of hemopoietic function can be expected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>With the assistance of a computer simulation model it appears possible to relate certain granulocyte response patterns to the extend and quality of damage caused in the hematopoietic stem cell pool </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The determination of this damage is of great importance because it quantifies the strain inflicted upon the hemopoietic system by radiation exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It must be remembered that some stem cells are intact or are able to repair the damage completely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These stem cells serve as the ultimate source of hemopoietic recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The other stem cells that are left with the restricted hematopoietic potential are the source for the so called abortive recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On this basis it must be recognized that the day-to-day detailed analysis of documentation of blood cell changes for the first 5-10 days after exposure is of critical importance in order to be able to answer the question whether a spontaneous hemopoietic recovery can be expected or not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>If the stem cell pool is sufficiently damaged (less than 6-8 in 10,000 stem cells) then one can expect a particular constellation of blood cells around day 5-7 characterized by severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001913'>granulocytopenia</z:hpo>, severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001888'>lymphopenia</z:hpo> and beginning <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This blood cell response pattern is indicative of an irreversible stem cell damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In this case, a transplantation of stem cells may well be life saving if done using the criteria developed for the treatment of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> by bone marrow transplantation including an appropriate conditioning regimen for immune suppression </plain></SENT>
