<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>From 10 of 10 patients with this disease the concentration of CFUc in the bone marrow cells significantly increased after the removal of phagocytic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, in bone marrow from only 4 of 27 controls, 22 non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> patients and 5 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteers, the concentration of CFUc increased after the same treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From these findings, it may be inferred that phagocytic cells from the bone marrow of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> suppress proliferation and differentiation of granulocytic progenitor cells, and that this phenomenon is related to the development of this disease </plain></SENT>
