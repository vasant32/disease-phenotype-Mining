<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In Taiwan, hematopoietic SCT (HSCT) has been used to treat patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematological diseases</z:e> since 1983 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since then, more than 2200 patients have undergone HSCT in 15 large hospitals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The disease entities included <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> in 37% of cases, non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> in 26%, <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> in 10%, <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> in 7% and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> in 6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The conditioning regimens used were mainly myeloablative (84% of cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Non-myeloablative regimens were fludarabine-based </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The average age of allogeneic recipients was at least 10 years older than those in the era before their application </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The grafts of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were derived from peripheral blood in 85% of cases, BM in 13% and cord blood (CB) in 2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Forty percent of HSCT patients received autologous grafts, whereas more than 25% of allogeneic HSCT patients received grafts from unrelated donors, and overall, there were more than 200 Taiwan HSCT recipients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Currently, CB has been used successfully in pediatric patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002875" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thalassemia major</z:e> and also in adult patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0848852,C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After transplantation, there was a relatively lower prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, a relatively higher proportion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> B carriers in the recipients had led to a higher incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> reactivation and clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo>, which was dramatically decreased following lamivudine prophylaxis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, HSCT has been successfully adapted to routine clinical care in Taiwan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Several important findings contributing to the progress of HSCT in the past two decades have also been noticed on this island </plain></SENT>
