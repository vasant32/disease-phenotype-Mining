<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The most striking finding was the early several-fold increase in the cycling fraction of stem and progenitor cells (with the exception of progenitors committed to megakaryocytopoiesis) in the anti-NK 1.1+ antibody-treated group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This increase resulted in an early, complete restoration of total marrow cellularity to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (+/+) littermate level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that NK 1.1+ cells exert functions critical to the negative control of hematopoietic cell proliferation in S1/S1d mice </plain></SENT>
