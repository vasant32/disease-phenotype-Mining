<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>80 children with AA were enrolled in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among of them, 34 patients collected from tissue typing test centers of Nanfang Hospital; 46 patients were diagnosed at Department of Pediatrics of Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In these patients, 48 were males, 32 were females, and with average age 8.1 years old, 6 cases were non-severe AA (nSAA), 74 case were severe AA (SAA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The healthy control group consisted of 109 donors who were from the same area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients and healthy controls were of Han Chinese, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> were unrelated individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The polymerase chain reaction sequence specific primers (PCR-SSP) was used to analyze the polymorphism of HLA-A, -B and -DRB1 alleles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pearson Chi-square or continuity correction or two-sided Fisher's exact test were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the genotype frequency of HLA-B*48:01 and DRB1*09:01 were significantly higher in children with AA as compared with healthy controls (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The genotype frequency of HLA-B*51:01, DRB1*03:01 and DRB1*11:01 were significantly lower in children with AA as compared with healthy controls (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Besides, the results also demonstrated that the genotype frequencies of HLA-B*48:01 and DRB1*09:01 were significantly higher in SAA as compared with controls, the genotype frequencies of B*51:01, DRB1*03:01 and DRB1*11:01 were significantly lower in SAA, as compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, HLA-B*48:01 and DRB1*09:01 are related with children AA, and may be susceptible alleles to the development of children AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Besides, the expression of HLA-B*51:01, DRB1*03:01 and DRB1*11:01 are low in children with AA, whether they are relative protection alleles of children needs to be further studied </plain></SENT>
