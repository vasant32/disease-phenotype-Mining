<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Four of twenty-five previously transfused recipients prepared with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> 200 mg/kg and total-lymphoid irradiation 3 Gy experienced graft failure, indicating that this regimen was inadequate to ensure sustained engraftment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Posttransplant treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> resulted in an actuarial incidence for grade greater than or equal to 2 graft-versus-host disease of 22 +/- 16% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Actuarial survival was 78 +/- 15% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that more effective treatment is necessary to prevent graft failure, but since many patients can be successfully retransplanted, overall survival is comparable to other recent studies </plain></SENT>
