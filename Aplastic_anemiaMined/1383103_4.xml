<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The extent of HbF reactivation in sickle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002875" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thalassemia major</z:e> is related to the presence of XmnI polymorphism at -158 G (gamma) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we have investigated whether in Fanconi's <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> the increase of the HbF is also related to the XmnI polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Restriction site polymorphisms in the beta-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="5386">globin</z:chebi> gene cluster were analyzed to define the beta-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="5386">globin</z:chebi> haplotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The presence of a C --&gt; T substitution at position -158 G (gamma) was investigated by XmnI digestion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found that patients with the XmnI site at -158 G (gamma), which was contained either in the 5' -+-++ or in the rare -+--- sub-haplotype, tend to have higher HbF and MCV values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The differences between XmnI positive and XmnI negative patients were highly significative (p less than 0.0025) for the MCV values, but barely significant for HbF levels (p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that in Fanconi's <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> both the extent of HbF reactivation and the fetal-like erythropoiesis, which is responsible for <z:mp ids='MP_0002590'>high MCV</z:mp>, are at least partially related to the beta-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="5386">globin</z:chebi> haplotype </plain></SENT>
