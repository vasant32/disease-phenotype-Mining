<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Trichothecenes are <z:chebi fb="2" ids="25442">mycotoxins</z:chebi> produced by various species of fungi which can occur on various agricultural products </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among these compounds, T-2 toxin, HT-2 toxin, diacetoxyscirpenol (DAS) and deoxynivalenol (DON) are the most naturally encountered and potent trichothecenes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Consumption of trichothecene contaminated foods by farm animals and humans leads to mycotoxicoses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Trichothecenes are known to induce haematologic disorders such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo>, <z:mp ids='MP_0003179'>thrombopenia</z:mp>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> in human and animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The aim of our investigations is to explore the effects of trichothecenes on the haematopoietic progenitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The four trichothecenes previously demonstrated to be strongly cytotoxic for human CFU-GM have been tested on human BFU-E </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For this purpose, a culture model of human erythroblastic progenitors (BFU-E) optimized for toxicological studies was used to determine the effects of T-2, HT-2, diacetoxyscirpenol (DAS) and deoxynivalenol (DON) on red blood cell precursor proliferation and differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Results showed that human BFU-E are as sensitive to trichothecenes as human CFU-GM, except for DON, in the range of concentrations tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Differentiation of erythroblastic progenitors could be perturbed by these <z:chebi fb="2" ids="25442">mycotoxins</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Human erythroblastic progenitors are also a target of trichothecenes </plain></SENT>
