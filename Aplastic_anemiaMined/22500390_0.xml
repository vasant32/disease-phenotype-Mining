<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To observe the therapeutic effects of Busui Shengxue Granule (BSSXG) on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (CAA) patients and its effects on bone marrow derived stroma cells (BMDSCs) correlated cytokines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred and twenty-four patients with CAA were randomly assigned to two groups according to the random digit table </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients in the test group (61 cases) were treated with BSSXG, while those in the control group (63 cases) were treated with Zaizao Shengxue Tablet (ZST) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The therapeutic course was 6 months for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Besides, 10 healthy subjects were recruited as the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Changes of the symptom integral, therapeutic efficacy judgment, and changes of peripheral hemogram of patients were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of b-fibroblast growth factors (bFGF) and b-fibroblast growth factors receptor (bFGFR) were detected by reverse transcription PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The total effective rate of the test group was 75.0% (45/61), higher than that of the control group (58.7%, 37/63) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Its symptom integral and peripheral hemogram were obviously improved, better than those of the control group (P &lt; 0.05, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expressions of bFGF and bFGFR of the test group were obviously lower than those of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control group (P &lt; 0.05, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>They were somewhat improved after treatment in the two groups, with better results obtained in the test group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: BSSXG showed better clinical effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It could improve the symptom integral and peripheral hemogram of CAA patients, improve the clinical efficacy, and regulate the expression levels of bFGF and bFGFR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It improved the hematopoietic microenvironment and promoted the hematopoiesis of the bone marrow through regulating the proliferation and oriental differentiation of stroma cells, and promoting the bone marrow <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
