<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We undertook a multi-institutional study of 112 children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> diagnosed between 1976 and 1996 and then treated with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressants</z:chebi> with or without G-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In each case, bone marrow specimens were tested at study entry and every 6 months for 3 years to detect t-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> as defined by morphologic and molecular/cytogenetic criteria </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Morphologic abnormalities were found in 17 cases </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The morphologic features of the patients with and without clonal cytogenetic abnormalities were indistinguishable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the mast cell content was lower in cases with cytogenetic abnormalities than in cases without them </plain></SENT>
