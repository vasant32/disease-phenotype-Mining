<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A multicenter randomized controlled study was undertaken in order to determine whether epoetin beta (EPO) ameliorates the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) patients treated with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Enrolled patients were randomized into 3 groups: group C receiving G-CSF alone as the control; group L receiving G-CSF and 200 IU/kg of EPO; group H receiving G-CSF and 400 IU/kg of EPO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Throughout the study, the dose and the administration interval of G-CSF were adjusted to maintain neutrophil counts between 1000 and 5000 microliters EPO was administered subcutaneously for 12 wk as the first step in treatment and when favorable effects were observed over this period, treatment was continued for another 12 wk as the second step in treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Significant erythroid responses were defined as increases in untransfused <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> values &gt; 1.0 g/dl or &gt; 50% decreases in RBC transfusion requirements over the treatment period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of 131 patients enrolled, 88 patients allocated to groups L and H were evaluated for toxicity to EPO and 110 were evaluated for erythroid responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four of the 31 patients (12.9%) in group C, 6 of the 41 patients (14.6%) of group L, and 14 of the 38 patients (36.8%) of group H showed erythroid responses in the first step in treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The erythroid responses of group H were significantly higher than those of the other 2 groups (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The significant effects of EPO were due to erythroid responses in non-severe AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Responding patients were significantly different from non-responders with regard to disease severity, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> concentration, reticulocyte count, serum endogenous erythropoietin levels and serum transferrin receptors; non-severe AA patients were more likely to respond to EPO, and responding patients had lower serum EPO and higher <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> concentration, reticulocyte count and serum transferrin receptors than non-responders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The response rate increased in the second step in treatment, suggesting that long-term treatment improved the efficacy of EPO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No serious side-effects were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>From these results, we conclude that EPO given in combination with G-CSF is a safe and effective alternative for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> of a subset of AA patients </plain></SENT>
