<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By 20 years of age, most affected boys develop <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo>, whereas female carriers show a skewed pattern of X-chromosome inactivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The gene product, dyskerin, is homologous to a yeast protein involved in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18111">ribosomal RNA</z:chebi> biogenesis, providing a unique insight into a cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Whereas most causative mutations are single amino acid substitutions, and nonsense or frameshift mutations have not been observed, we present here a case of DC caused by a 2-kb deletion that removes the last exon of the gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> levels of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> are produced from the deleted gene, with the transcripts using a cryptic polyadenylation site in the antisense strand of the adjacent MPP1 gene, normally located 1 kb downstream of DKC1 in a tail to tail orientation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The predicted truncated protein lacks a lysine-rich <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> that is less conserved than the rest of the dyskerin molecule and is dispensable in yeast, supporting the contention that it may retain some activity and that null mutations at this locus may be lethal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The affected boy had an unaffected brother with the same haplotype around the DKC1 gene and a sister who was heterozygous for the deletion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude therefore that the mother must be a germline mosaic with respect to this deletion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Investigation of her blood cells and other somatic tissues showed that a small proportion of these cells also carried the deletion, making her a somatic mosaic and indicating that the deletion took place early in development </plain></SENT>
