<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The hematotoxic effects of <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> are well documented and include <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Some individuals exposed repeatedly to cytotoxic concentrations of <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> develop <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> myeloblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It has been hypothesized that metabolism of <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> is required for its toxicity, although administration of no single <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> metabolite duplicates the toxicity of <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Several investigators have demonstrated that a combination of metabolites (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="17594">hydroquinone</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="43" ids="15882">phenol</z:chebi>, for example) is necessary to duplicate the hematotoxic effect of <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Enzymes implicated in the metabolic activation of <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> and its metabolites include the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38559">cytochrome P450</z:chebi> monooxygenases and myeloperoxidase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Since <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> and its hydroxylated metabolites (<z:chebi fb="43" ids="15882">phenol</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17594">hydroquinone</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="18135">catechol</z:chebi>) are substrates for the same <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38559">cytochrome P450</z:chebi> enzymes, competitive interactions among the metabolites are possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In vivo data on metabolite formation by mice exposed to various <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> concentrations are consistent with competitive inhibition of <z:chebi fb="43" ids="15882">phenol</z:chebi> oxidation by <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Other organic molecules that are substrates for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38559">cytochrome P450</z:chebi> can inhibit the metabolism of <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For example, <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17578">toluene</z:chebi> has been shown to inhibit the oxidation of <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> in a noncompetitive manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Enzyme inducers, such as <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi>, can alter the target tissue dosimetry of <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> metabolites by inducing enzymes responsible for oxidation reactions involved in <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The dosimetry of <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> and its metabolites in the target tissue, bone marrow, depends on the balance of activation processes, such as enzymatic oxidation, and deactivation processes, like conjugation and excretion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
