<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We serially determined serum erythropoietin (Epo) and the reticulocyte count in patients with various types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> during chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Serum Epo increased soon after the initiation of chemotherapy and decreased after the termination of therapy irrespective of the types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> or treatment regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, it did not stay at low level but fluctuated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The reticulocyte count, on the other hand, showed a transient rise while serum Epo level descended </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The value of serum Epo when increased was higher than the value expected from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> concentration; this finding was similar to that in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854467" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myelosuppression</z:e> is a major factor for the increase in serum Epo level during <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
