<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The blood samples were collected from 37 patients diagnosed as severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> in West China Hospital of Sichuan University and West China Second Hospital of Sichuan University during February, 2006 to March, 2007 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty healthy blood donors were used as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The plasma levels of IFN-gamma and IL-2 were measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay, and the gene phenotype of HLA-DRB1 * 15 and HLA-DRB1 * 1501 was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction with sequence specific primer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expressions of CD55 and CD59 on the cellular membrane of red blood cell and white blood cells also were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The response rate in the patients who had higher IL-2 level before IST was significantly better than that in the patients with lower IL-2 level (66.7% vs 28.6%, P&lt;0.05), while similar result was observed to IFN-gamma (73.7% vs 25.0%, P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The response rate in the patients with positive HLA-DRB1 * 15 was higher than that in those negative patients (62.5% vs 44.4%, P&gt;0.05), but there was no different found in different HLA-DRB1 * 1501 phenotypes (50% vs 50%, P&gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The response rates in the patients with deficient CD55 and CD59 expression were higher than those expressed CD55 and CD59 normally (80.0% vs 40.0%, P&gt;0.05); the response rate of patients younger than 40 years was higher than those older than 40 years (60.0% vs 14.3%, P&lt;0.05); the response rate in female patients was higher than male patients (62.5% vs 42.9%, P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The concentration of IL-2, IFN-gamma before IST, and age can be used as the predicting factors to immunosuppressive therapy, while the predicting value of HLA-DRB1 * 15, HLA- DRB1 * 1501 and CD55, CD59 to the response of IST still remain unclear </plain></SENT>
