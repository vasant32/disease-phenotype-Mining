<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This case of a 6-year-old boy with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> is the first reported association of this disease with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> A <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Antibody to <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> A (anti-HA) was not detected on admission, but was detected three weeks later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Infection</z:e> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> B virus, cytomegalovirus (CMV), and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The peak titer of anti-HA was higher than would be expected for passive transfer of antibody resulting from transfusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The persistence of antibody for more than 20 months after the last transfusion was not consistent with passive antibody, which would be expected to disappear over that time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This child had indications for allogeneic marrow transplant and a sibling donor who was histocompatible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the transplant was postponed because the prognosis was considered to be poor in the presence of active <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a spontaneous remission without the necessity of the transplantation procedure </plain></SENT>
