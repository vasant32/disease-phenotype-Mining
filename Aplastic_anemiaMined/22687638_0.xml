<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We decided to verify whether pathological telomere <z:mpath ids='MPATH_580'>erosion</z:mpath> also arises in restored Philadelphia-negative (Ph-negative) hematopoiesis following successful treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eighty-one <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> patients in complete cytogenetic remission were compared to 76 age-matched healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Myeloid cells of <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> patients had shorter telomeres than controls (6521 bp vs 7233 bp, p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This difference was specific for the myeloid compartment, since it was not observed in lymphoid cells (6774 bp vs 6909 bp, p=0.620) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Acquired Ph-negative cytogenetic abnormalities (p=0.010), lack of complete molecular remission (p=0.016) and age (p=0.013) were independent predictors of telomere shortening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Telomere dynamics were assessed over a median follow-up period of 22 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We documented accelerated non-physiological ongoing telomere shortening in 17/59 <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> patients (28%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients experiencing grade 2-4 hematological toxicity, during <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> remission possessed significantly shorter telomeres compared to those lacking toxicity (p=0.005 for any toxicity, p=0.007 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> patients suffer from significant and often ongoing telomere stress resulting in premature and selective aging of the myeloid compartment which might have long-term consequences on function and integrity of Ph-negative hematopoiesis </plain></SENT>
