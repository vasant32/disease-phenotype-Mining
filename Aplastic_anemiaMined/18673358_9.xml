<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They have therefore been suggested to enhance engraftment after autologous and allogeneic <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSC</z:chebi> transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In patients undergoing transplantation, MSC infusion was shown to be safe and to enhance engraftment of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSC</z:chebi>, as well as to reduce the incidence of both <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We cotransplanted haploidentical AMSC with HLA-identical sibling-matched PBSC in two pediatric patients with refractory SAA after primary or secondary graft failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At present, the two patients are more than two yr after cotransplantation without any treatment, transfusion-independent and in good condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, cotransplantation of MSC might enhance engraftment of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSC</z:chebi> in patients regrafted for graft failure </plain></SENT>
