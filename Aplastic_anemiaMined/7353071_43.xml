<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Forty-two patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) were studied to determine whether or not transfusion-induced sensitization is responsible for the in vitro inhibition by patient lymphocytes of HLA-identical erythroid burst-forming units (BFU-E) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that lymphocytes from 12 of 34 transfused patients inhibited <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colony growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast, lymphocytes from none of the 8 untransfused patients demonstrated inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These data were interpreted to mean that coculture studies would not be useful for identifying immune-mediated AA in transfused patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, in order to identify possible immune-related AA, we assayed BFU-E from patient blood before and after T-cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 32 patients studied, BFU-E failed to grow from peripheral blood cells before T-cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath>, but in 8 cases, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-appearing BFU-E grew after T cells had been removed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Growth of patient BFU-E colonies was inhibited in 6 cases when patient T cells were added back to the culture, indicating that in these 6 patients, an "autoimmune" mechanism may have been present </plain></SENT>
