<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Although the known clinical courses of non-severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (NSAA) in children comprise spontaneous resolution, persistent NSAA, or progression to severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (SAA), only a few published reports have indicated the outcome of transfusion-independent NSAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively evaluated the incidence and time of progression from transfusion-independent to transfusion-dependent NSAA or SAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We reviewed the records of 70 children with acquired AA who were referred to our hospital between 1986 and 2006, and among them we found 22 patients who had transfusion-independent NSAA at diagnosis and were treated with supportive care alone until progression to transfusion-dependent AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>22 patients were followed up for a median of 86 months (range, 11-198 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Kaplan-Meier estimates for progression-free survival were 62 +/- 12 and 22 +/- 13% at 60 and 120 months after diagnosis, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>None of the patients treated with supportive care alone improved hematologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, because the incidence of disease progression was high in patients with NSAA, a prospective randomized trial of early intervention with IST or observation alone until disease progression to SAA, followed by IST when the patients become transfusion-dependent is warranted </plain></SENT>
