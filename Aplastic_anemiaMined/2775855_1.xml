<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A new controversy has emerged over the results of a case-control study alleging a causal relationship between certain <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35475">non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents</z:chebi> (NSAIAs) and the risks of <z:mp ids='MP_0000334'>agranulocytosis</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After describing the methods and results of the International <z:mp ids='MP_0000334'>Agranulocytosis</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>Aplastic Anemia</z:hpo> (IAAA) study, we review the distinctive methodologic challenges of this study and the requirements for avoiding bias, and then reconcile the study results with the principles of case-control design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As a result of our analysis, we believe that the IAAA study's most important and reliable finding is its documentation of the infrequent occurrences of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0000334'>agranulocytosis</z:mp> with <z:chebi fb="29" ids="35480">analgesic</z:chebi> use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, a causal association between NSAIAs and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">blood dyscrasias</z:e> has not been suitably established, and may well have resulted from several distinctive sources of bias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These include the effects of diagnostic-suspicion bias in case determination, of exclusion bias in choosing controls, of recall bias in determining exposure, and of publicity bias in both case selection and ascertainment of exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These problems could have been avoided and a more valid result obtained with closer attention to the experimental paradigm for case-control research </plain></SENT>
