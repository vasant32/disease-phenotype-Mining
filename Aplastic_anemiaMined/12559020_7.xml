<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Delayed <z:mp ids='MP_0010163'>hemolysis</z:mp> mediated by long-term production of pre-existing recipient-derived antibodies directed against donor RBC antigens after allogenic BMT is an unusual complication of hematopoietic transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: A 26-year-old man with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> had pre-existing alloantibodies to E and c </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>He received BMT from a donor, whose Rh phenotype was E+, c+ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From about 1 month after the transplant, he showed mild <z:mp ids='MP_0010163'>hemolysis</z:mp> due to the antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The patient was typed as group B, CCDee and had anti-E and c alloantibodies before BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The donor was typed as group O, ccDEE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although MNCs from the donor marrow were infused into the patient, DAT became positive on Day 21, and the patient-origin antibodies remained detectable by both DAT and IAT even 20 months after BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, immunomagnetically isolated peripheral circulating B cells were 100 percent donor origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The patient received <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> from Day 221, and thereafter, the signs of <z:mp ids='MP_0010163'>hemolysis</z:mp> disappeared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: It is likely that the long-term production of alloantibodies is due to the existence of long-lived recipient plasma cells, which survive the conditioning regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This case suggests that patients with pre- existing alloantibodies that do not belong to the ABO system should be carefully followed up after BMT </plain></SENT>
