<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A positive message was expressed by a human cell line, CM-S, derived from a patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004810'>congenital hypoplastic anemia</z:hpo>, and by a murine erythro-leukaemic cell line, clone 707, derived from the spleen of Friend virus-infected mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No message was detected in two megakaryoblastic cell lines, and in a monocytic cell line, derived from a patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_502'>monocytic leukaemia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These data may fit with the hypothesis of expression of Epo and other growth factors by haemopoietic cells through a mechanism of so-called autocrine secretion </plain></SENT>
