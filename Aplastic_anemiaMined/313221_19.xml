<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We performed serial agar cultures (CFU-C) using marrow cells from a patient with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi>-responsive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and from five patients with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi>-resistant <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Colony growth was decreased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">Cortisol</z:chebi> (10(-7)-10(-4)M) significantly enhanced colony growth in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi>-responsive patient but fauled to enhance colony growth in the remaining five patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Further studies in the responsive patient indicated that (1) colony growth was enhanced by depleting T lymphocytes from the marrow cells, (2) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0599725" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">colon growth</z:e> T-depleted marrow cells was inhibited by autologous peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL), (3) <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi> failed to enhance colony growth of T-depleted marrow cells, (4) PBL and PBL-conditioned medium inhibited colony growth of both autologous and allogeneic marrow cells, but neither <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi>-treated PBL nor T-depleted PBL were inhibitory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serial cultures in the responsive patient showed that colony growth normalized during remission when "suppressor" cells were absent and that colony growth was subnormal during a later relapse when <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi>-resistant "suppressor" cells were present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, in this <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi>-responsive patient, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi>-sensitive T lymphocytes suppressed granulopoiesis in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our observations suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> in this patient is immunologically mediated and that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> therapy enhanced hemopoiesis in vivo by inhibiting the "suppressor" T lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
