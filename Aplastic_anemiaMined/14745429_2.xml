<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> is characterized by loss or dysfunction of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The proinflammatory cytokines <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) may be responsible for the immune-mediated pathology observed in some patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The CD34+ population of bone marrow mononuclear cells contains primitive cells responsible for hemopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated the response of CD34+ cells from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> patients to a combination of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha, and compared them to cells from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteer donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This was to determine whether aplastic CD34+ cells are more sensitive than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cells to IFN-gamma/TNF-alpha-mediated effects, and whether cytokine-induced CD95 expression can explain the high levels of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> observed in CD34+ cells from aplastic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CD34+38- cells were most affected by overnight incubation with these cytokines, their proportion and numbers being reduced in both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> donors and patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no evidence for <z:mp ids='MP_0006042'>increased apoptosis</z:mp>, suggesting that this effect may be due to differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>IFN-gamma/TNF-alpha induced upregulation of CD95 on both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and aplastic CD34+ cells, although the basal level of CD95 expression was increased in aplastic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, CD95 induction did not make cells from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> donors or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> patients susceptible to induction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> by agonistic anti-CD95 antibodies, soluble CD95 ligand, or membrane-bound CD95L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In vivo CD95L is required for CD95 induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No forms of this protein were detectable in lymphocytes from aplastic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We conclude that <z:mp ids='MP_0006042'>increased apoptosis</z:mp> in aplastic CD34+ cells is not due to increased sensitivity to IFN-gamma/TNF-alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We further show that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and aplastic CD34+ cells are resistant to CD95 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, even in the presence of mCD95L </plain></SENT>
