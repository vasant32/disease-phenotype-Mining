<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The pathogenetic factors are still unclear: damage or inhibition of hemopoietic stem cells may be direct or indirect mediated through changes in the cellular humoral environment; evidence is accumulating that in some cases these processes are of autoimmune nature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The prognostic evaluation is based on hematological parameters at diagnosis: severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (SAA) is defined by the following criteria: neutrophils less than 0.5 X 10(9)/l; reticulocytes less than 0.5 X 10(9)/l and platelets less than 20 X 10(9)/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Survival rates in children with SAA are poor; the probability of survival at 1 year from diagnosis being 10% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this form treatment is based on supportive therapy (transfusion and prevention of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e>) and on a specific therapy: immunosuppression and/or BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>BMT is reserved to patient with an HLA identical sibling donor and may be curative in 70-80% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To date the use of antilymphocytoglobulin in SAA has also given satisfactory results with a favorable response in 50-60% of cases </plain></SENT>
