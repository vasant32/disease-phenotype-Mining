<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The hematotoxic effects of <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> in humans are well documented and include <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A combination of metabolites (<z:chebi fb="1" ids="17594">hydroquinone</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="43" ids="15882">phenol</z:chebi> for example) is apparently necessary to duplicate the hematotoxic effect of <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi>, perhaps due in part to the synergistic effect of <z:chebi fb="43" ids="15882">phenol</z:chebi> on myeloperoxidase-mediated oxidation of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17594">hydroquinone</z:chebi> to the reactive metabolite <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16509,39439">benzoquinone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Since <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> and its hydroxylated metabolites (<z:chebi fb="43" ids="15882">phenol</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17594">hydroquinone</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="18135">catechol</z:chebi>) are substrates for the same <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38559">cytochrome P450</z:chebi> enzymes, competitive interactions among the metabolites are possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In vivo data on metabolite formation by mice exposed to various <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> concentrations are consistent with competitive inhibition of <z:chebi fb="43" ids="15882">phenol</z:chebi> oxidation by <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In vitro studies of the metabolic oxidation of <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="43" ids="15882">phenol</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17594">hydroquinone</z:chebi> are consistent with the mechanism of competitive interaction among the metabolites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The dosimetry of <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> and its metabolites in the target tissue, bone marrow, depends on the balance of activation processes such as enzymatic oxidation and deactivation processes such as conjugation and excretion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="43" ids="15882">Phenol</z:chebi>, the primary <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> metabolite, can undergo both oxidation and conjugation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, the potential exists for competition among various enzymes for <z:chebi fb="43" ids="15882">phenol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, zonal localization of Phase I and Phase II enzymes in various regions of the liver acinus regulates this competition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Biologically-based dosimetry models that incorporate the important determinants of <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> flux, including interactions with other chemicals, will enable prediction of target tissue doses of <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> and metabolites at low exposure concentrations relevant for humans </plain></SENT>
