<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The following major results were obtained </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in industrial types among the four surveys </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The numbers of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> patients newly diagnosed were 145 (112 males/33 females) in the first survey, 21 (16/5) in the second survey, 51 (41/10) in the third survey and 30(24/6) in the fourth survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Incidence rates per million were 14.7 (14.4 males/15.5 females) in the first and second survey, 14.2 (13.5/18.3) in the third survey and 9.1 (8.6/11.9) in the fourth survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The rates were almost constant from 1970 through 1980, but the rates decreased thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The rate was higher in females than in males, but the difference was not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Incidence rates were high in rubber industry (26.8 per million), paper industry (24.8), and petroleum industry (22.5), but there was no industrial type demonstrating a constantly higher incidence in every survey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Manufacturing industries showed a higher incidence (14.6) than nonmanufacturing industries (11.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>By type of work, non-productive work (67.2%), i.e., clerical (30.8%), administrative (8.9%), technical (7.7%), were the main jobs of 247 registered <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> patients (193 males and 54 females) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Thirty patients had been exposed to noxious agents such as organic solvents (21 cases including 3 exposed to <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi>), metals (6), and radiation (1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>However, in these cases no causal relationship between exposure and disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> could be demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Thirty-nine cases had a drug-intake history before <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Drugs given included <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17698">chloramphenicol</z:chebi> (4 cases), other antibiotics (4), antituberculosis agents (8), <z:chebi fb="29" ids="35480">analgesics</z:chebi> (6), and tranquillers (4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The results obtained revealed no positive evidence that occupational factors peculiar to Japanese industries were involved in triggering <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
