<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A total of 16 children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> were investigated, among them 6 girls and 10 boys, the mean age 10.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Splenectomy was included into the complex of treatment along with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoid</z:chebi> and transfusion-replacement therapy of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The membrane markers of splenic lymphocytes were assayed in the indirect immunofluorescence test with monoclonal antibodies of ICO and OKT series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean parameters did not significantly differ from those of subpopulations of splenic lymphocytes in the control group described in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An individual analysis made in 8 patients (50%) has revealed active lymphocyte populations in the spleen: in the group of patients with a favourable prognosis to the disease an increase in the percent of B-cells was recorded in 2, OKT8(+)-lymphocytes in 1 patient; a rise in the percent of cells with receptors to interleukin-2 in 3 patients (from 25 to 32%); in the group of patients with severe <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> an increase in the percent of activated HLA-DR(+)-lymphocytes was recorded in 2, and OKT8(+)-lymphocytes in 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients responded well to the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested that in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases the splenectomy effect is associated with the removal of immunoactive lymphocytes and can serve as an equivalent of the immunosuppressive therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The effect of splenectomy in the rest cases has been obscure </plain></SENT>
