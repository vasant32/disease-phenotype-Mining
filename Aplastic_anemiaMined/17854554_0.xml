<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Blood serum of AA mice was made from an AA mouse model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Blood serums containing different traditional Chinese compound herbal medicine were made from rats after intragastric administration of JPBSHXP and its related decoctions, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow cells of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mice were incubated by these blood serums for 24 hours, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of the bone marrow cells were assayed by flow cytometry and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: It was indicated that the bone marrow cells of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mice incubated with blood serum of AA mice displayed typical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> rates of bone marrow cells of the AA mice incubated by blood serum containing different traditional Chinese herbal medicine were decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The effect of Bushen (reinforcing kidey) Recipe was better than Jianpi (strengthening spleen) Recipe and Huoxue (activating blood circulation) Recipe, while the effect of JPBSHXP was the best </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>TEM results showed that the effect of Bushen Recipe was better than that of the Jianpi Recipe and the Huoxue Recipe, while the effect of JPBSHXP was the best </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: JPBSHXP and its related decoctions can significantly decrease the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> rate of bone marrow mononuclear cells of the AA mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It is inferred that JPBSHXP can promote bone marrow hematogenesis </plain></SENT>
