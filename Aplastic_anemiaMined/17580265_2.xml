<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We conducted a prospective trial with an intermediate to high dose of total body irradiation (TBI) in combination with a fixed dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (120 mg/kg) to use for pretransplant conditioning for unrelated donor bone marrow transplantation in adult <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The number of patients who received doses of 1200, 1000, and 800 cGy of TBI were 5, 9, and 26, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The corresponding probabilities of overall survival (OS) at 3 years were 40%, 44%, and 92%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidence of regimen-related toxicity with grade III-IV and graft rejection in the patients who received a dose of 800 cGy of TBI were 0 of 26 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The significant factors associated with OS were the TBI dose (800 cGy vs. &gt;or=1000 cGy; P = .001), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (less than or equal to limited vs. extensive; P = .013), the method of HLA typing for the donor-recipient matching (serologic typing vs. DNA-based typing; P = .006), and the transfusion amount before transplantation (&lt;or=90 vs. &gt;90 units; P = .020) </plain></SENT>
