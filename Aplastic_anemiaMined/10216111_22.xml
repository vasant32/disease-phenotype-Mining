<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The threshold for prophylactic platelet transfusions in patients with hypoplastic <z:mp ids='MP_0003179'>thrombopenia</z:mp> generally recommended in the standard literature is 20,000 platelets/microL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A more restrictive transfusion policy may be indicated in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (SAA) in need of long-term platelet support </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the feasibility and safety of a policy with low thresholds for prophylactic transfusions (&lt;/=5,000 platelets/microL in stable patients; 6,000 to 10,000 platelets/microL in cases with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> and/or hemorrhagic signs) combined with progressive lengthening of transfusion intervals (up to at least 7 days irrespective of the interim course of platelet counts) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study was based on a retrospective analysis of a total of 18,706 patient days with platelet counts &lt;/=10,000/microL in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> SAA treated (for more than 3 months) on an outpatient basis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Altogether, 1,135 platelet transfusions were given, 88% at counts &lt;/=10, 000/microL and 57% at counts &lt;/=5,000/microL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean transfusion interval was 10 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During the period of observation, three major nonlethal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> complications occurred, which could be well controlled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the restrictive policy with low transfusion thresholds and prolonged transfusion intervals proved feasible and safe in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> SAA patients </plain></SENT>
