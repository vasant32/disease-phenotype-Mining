<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sulfhydryl reagent-treated proteins retained full activity of megakaryocyte colony-stimulating factor (Meg-CSF) and erythropoietin (Epo), except with DTNB-treated protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Reduction-carboxymethylation and reduction-mercuration resulted in complete loss of Meg-CSF and Epo activities, suggesting that one of the essential chemical groups of Meg-CSF and Epo is a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48343">disulfide</z:chebi> bond </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Reduction of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48343">disulfide</z:chebi> bonds at neutral pH revealed that Meg-CSF is less susceptible to reduction than Epo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Reactivation occurred by spontaneous reoxidation in most of the reduced Meg-CSF (92.6%) and part of the reduced Epo (22.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These molecular behaviors may reflect differences in the spatial configurations of Meg-CSF and Epo </plain></SENT>
