<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Approximately 11,000 transplants have been performed worldwide since 1970 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>About two-thirds of these transplants have involved donors, including related and unrelated individuals, and in the remaining third the patient's bone marrow has been used in the form of an autotransplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In some disorders and under carefully defined circumstances, bone marrow transplantation appears to be the preferred therapy; these diseases include <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo>, and selected immune and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In other circumstances, the value of bone marrow transplantation is less well defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Diseases in which bone marrow transplantation may be of benefit include Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039730" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thalassemia</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852325" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemoglobinopathies</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic disorders</z:e>, and possibly <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It has been difficult to precisely identify the role of bone marrow transplantation in many of these diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Prospective randomized controlled clinical trials have sometimes shown an advantage for bone marrow transplantation, but in most circumstances a benefit is as yet unproven </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the U.S. the annual incidence of individuals with diseases in which bone marrow transplantation is thought to be of proven benefit is approximately 5,400, and an additional 15,000 individuals annually have diseases in which bone marrow transplantation is thought to be of possible benefit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study reviews data available from both controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials indicating the potential role of bone marrow transplantation in the treatment of human diseases </plain></SENT>
