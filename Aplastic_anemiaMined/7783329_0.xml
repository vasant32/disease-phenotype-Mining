<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Four (17%) of 24 hematologically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> females had a skewed Lyonization pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It, however, appeared that in the majority of cases clonality determination of myeloid cells would be possible in comparison with lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
