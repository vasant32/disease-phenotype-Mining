<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Anti-infective drug use in the 2-week period before the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of illness was compared between 251 patients admitted to hospital with <z:mp ids='MP_0000334'>agranulocytosis</z:mp> and 1271 controls hospitalized for reasons judged to be unrelated to previous use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35441">anti-infective drugs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Anti-infectives significantly associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0000334'>agranulocytosis</z:mp> when used for at least 3 consecutive days were <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45924">trimethoprim</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="9332">sulfamethoxazole</z:chebi> (relative risk, 12; 95% confidence interval, 3.9 to 40) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25106">macrolides</z:chebi> (infinity) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The relative risk estimate for any use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35358">sulfonamides</z:chebi> without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45924">trimethoprim</z:chebi> was elevated, but not statistically significant (3.6; 0.7 to 18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These estimates took confounding by various factors, in particular the use of other drugs, into account </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The estimated excess risks of <z:mp ids='MP_0000334'>agranulocytosis</z:mp> attributable to the use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45924">trimethoprim</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="9332">sulfamethoxazole</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25106">macrolides</z:chebi> in a 2-week period were 1.6 and 7.1 per million, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Anti-infective use during the 29- through 180-day period before hospital admission was compared between 135 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and 1410 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although relative risk point estimates were elevated for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45924">trimethoprim</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35358">sulfonamides</z:chebi> (2.1), other <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35358">sulfonamides</z:chebi> (2.9), and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35627">beta-lactams</z:chebi> (1.5), none was statistically significant </plain></SENT>
