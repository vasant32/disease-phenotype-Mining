<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, two heterozygous truncating mutations of the thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor MPL, coded by the c-mpl gene, were identified in a 10-year-old Japanese patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CAMT</z:e> transmitted in an <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal recessive</z:hpo> manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we report for the first time two different MPL amino-acid substitutions in a 2-year-old Italian boy with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CAMT</z:e> and compound heterozygosis for two (c-mpl point mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>C-to-T transitions were detected on exons 5 and 12 at the 769 and 1904 cDNA nucleotide positions, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mutation in exon 5 substitutes an arginine with a cysteine (R257C) in the extracellular domain, 11 amino acids distant from the WSXWS motif conserved in the cytokine-receptor superfamily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mutation in exon 12 substitutes a proline with a leucine (P635L) in the last amino acid of the C-terminal intracellular domain, responsible for signal transduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As in the Japanese family, the mutations were both transmitted from the parents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>TPO plasma levels were highly increased in the patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The patient's 7-year-old brother, who was a candidate donor for allografting, turned out to be an asymptomatic heterozygous carrier of P635L and showed defective megakaryocyte colony formation from bone-marrow progenitor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The present study provides important confirmation that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CAMT</z:e> can be associated with (c-mpl) mutations </plain></SENT>
