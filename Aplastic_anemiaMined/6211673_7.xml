<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The present study was aimed at investigating recovery of humoral immunity in vitro after bone marrow transplantation in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hemolytic plaque assays were utilized to quantitate pokeweed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>-stimulated polyclonal immunoglobulin production and sheep erythrocyte antigen-specific antibody responses in cultures of peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 39 patients beginning at 1 month, for variable periods up to a maximum of 4 years after marrow transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three phases were identified: an early period of primary <z:mp ids='MP_0002459'>B cell dysfunction</z:mp> with concomitant immunoregulatory <z:mp ids='MP_0008037'>T cell abnormalities</z:mp>--i.e., decreased helper and increased suppressor activities; an intermediate phase in which <z:mp ids='MP_0002459'>B cell dysfunction</z:mp> could be attributed in large measure to immunoregulatory <z:mp ids='MP_0008037'>T cell abnormalities</z:mp>; and a late phase of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> B and T lymphocyte functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> differed from those without it in that they often did not manifest increased T cell suppressor activity in the early period, and they were noted to have prolonged and profound B and <z:mp ids='MP_0008037'>T cell abnormalities</z:mp> in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phase of their disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In selected patients, simultaneous assessment of ratios of Leu-2 to Leu-3 antigens on T cells by monoclonal antibodies and of immunoregulatory T cell functions revealed a correlation between the two only late in the post-transplant period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These studies provide an insight into the ontogeny of B cell function in the post-transplant period and indicate that in certain situations phenotypic alterations in T cell subsets cannot reliably be used to predict abnormalities in their function in recipients of marrow transplantation </plain></SENT>
