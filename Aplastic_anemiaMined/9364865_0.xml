<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 24-year-old woman was diagnosed as having SAA and was initially treated with G-CSF, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> and danazole </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At initial presentation, bone marrow aspirate revealed marked hypocellularity with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype (46, XX [20]) and no <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> features </plain></SENT>
