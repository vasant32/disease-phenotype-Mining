<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We recently encountered an <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> patient for whom the ability of molecular HLA typing to utilize alternative sources of DNA proved to be fundamental for her treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After repeated failures to obtain HLA typing using peripheral blood, HLA-DR and DQ alleles were identified by molecular techniques utilizing two hairs as a source of DNA, ultimately resulting in successful BMT from a sibling donor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This case clearly illustrates the potential of DNA methodologies for HLA typing in patients whose condition precludes the use of more traditional methods </plain></SENT>
