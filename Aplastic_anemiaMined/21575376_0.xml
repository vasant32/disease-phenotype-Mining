<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Thirty-five children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) were enrolled in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Six of the cases had very severe AA (VSAA), 11 had severe AA (SAA)-I, 8 had SAA-II and 10 had moderate AA (<z:chebi fb="8" ids="35738">MAA</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> these patients were treated with ATG plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">Cyclosporin A</z:chebi> (CSA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The following measures were taken during the ATG therapy: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> of the patients had been controlled before ATG treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Comprehensive anti-allergic measures were implemented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Close attention was paid to the <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> related with platelet reduction caused by ATG and severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULT: Shortly after the ATG usage, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients had a significant decrease of absolute peripheral lymphoblast count by more than 60 percent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>With a mean follow-up time of 28 months, the total effective rate was 77.14% (27/35), significant response rate was 57.14%(20/35) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference among VSAA, SAA and <z:chebi fb="8" ids="35738">MAA</z:chebi> groups in the response rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Adverse reactions included the following: (1) 48.6% (17/35) patients presented mild <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0340865" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">anaphylactoid reaction</z:e> during the first day of ATG treatment; (2) 42.9%(15/35) cases presented <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036830" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">serum sickness</z:e> 5 - 11 days after the last dose of ATG with a mean duration of 3.6 days, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients were cured effectively with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi>; (3) 25.7% (9/35) patient's peripheral blood platelet count was reduced, might be caused by ATG, to below 10 Ã— 10(9)/L, but no patient had severe hemorrhagic complication after platelet transfusion was performed; (4) 22.9%(8/35)of patients got <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> within a month after ATG therapy, including 3 cases with clinical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_681'>septicemia</z:mpath>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the 3 cases recovered after antibiotics treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was no ATG treatment-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in this series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: ATG is a very effective therapy for children with SAA and <z:chebi fb="8" ids="35738">MAA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Comprehensive measures are needed to prevent and handle the side effects to avoid treatment-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Long-term supportive therapy and proper follow up contribute to the favourable outcomes of the patients </plain></SENT>
