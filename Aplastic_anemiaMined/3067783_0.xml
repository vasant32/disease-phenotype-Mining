<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These two activities appear not to be produced by immune competent cells. "Direct" stimulatory activity acts in primary target cultures of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There does not appear to be a feedback mechanism between <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> and "direct" activity; it appears to reflect ongoing disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Indirect "releaser" activity stimulates peripheral blood cells to produce hemopoietic growth factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is invariably elevated when release of hemopoietic growth factors is poor, indicating that a feedback mechanism exists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The peripheral blood cells of young patients, particularly young girls, respond poorly to autologous "releaser" stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results of treatment with ALG in this group are poor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> appear capable of producing adequate amounts "releaser" factor </plain></SENT>
