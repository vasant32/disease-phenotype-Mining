<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Little is known regarding the health-related quality of life (HRQL) trajectory of children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sickle cell disease</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039730" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thalassemia</z:e> ("<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852325" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemoglobinopathies</z:e>") following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PROCEDURES: We serially evaluated the HRQL of 13 children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852325" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemoglobinopathies</z:e> who received HSCT during two prospective multi-center studies using the Child Health Ratings Inventories (CHRIs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The HRQL scores among children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852325" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemoglobinopathies</z:e>, as reported separately by the children and their parents were compared using repeated measures models to scores of a comparison group of children receiving HSCT for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> or severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The sample included 13 children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852325" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemoglobinopathies</z:e> (median age: 8 years, range 5-18) and 268 children in the comparison group (median age: 11 years, range 5-18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were similar rates of early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft versus host disease</z:e>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>-cause mortality between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in recovery to baseline scores for physical, emotional, and role functioning by 3 months for either group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852325" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemoglobinopathies</z:e> had higher HRQL scores for physical (beta = 12, se = 5.5, P = 0.01) and baseline emotional functioning (beta = 11.6, se = 5.5, P = 0.03) than the comparison group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> domains for both groups, parent reports demonstrated a nadir at 45 days with recovery to baseline by 3 months following transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Children's ratings were higher than those of their parents in both diagnostic groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852325" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemoglobinopathies</z:e> had higher physical and emotional functioning scores prior to HSCT and experienced a similar pattern of recovery to their baseline functioning by 3 months post-HSCT when compared to children receiving HSCT for acquired conditions </plain></SENT>
