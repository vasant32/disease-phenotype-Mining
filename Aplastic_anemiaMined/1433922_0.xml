<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Case 1, a 25-year-old man with idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, was treated with ATG 6 months after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One month after treatment, his peripheral blood count and bone marrow cellularity recovered, and the MRI bone marrow pattern became <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Case 2, a 78-year-old woman with drug-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, was treated with ATG 4 months after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three months after treatment, her peripheral blood count improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five months after treatment, her bone marrow cellularity recovered and the MRI bone marrow pattern was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> for her age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seven months after treatment, when her peripheral blood count was almost <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, we observed hypercellular bone marrow restoration at the periphery of the vertebrae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MRI seems to be an effective method of evaluating bone marrow recovery in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
