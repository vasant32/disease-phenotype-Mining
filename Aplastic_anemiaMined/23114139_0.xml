<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 40 patients with acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and 20 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects as control were collected to detect <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of TRF1, TRF2 and RAP1 by using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the expression levels of TRF1 and RAP1 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients with acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> were significantly higher than that in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (P &lt; 0.05), while the expression level of TRF2 was lower than that in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was significant correlation between TRF2 and RAP1 expressions level (r = 0.522, P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the changes in expression levels of TRF1, TRF2 and RAP1 may play a role in the pathogenesis of acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
