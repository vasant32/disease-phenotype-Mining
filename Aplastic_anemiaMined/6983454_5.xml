<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Median age was 27 (5-74) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two additional patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> received ATG but were excluded from analysis after development of bone marrow morphologic and cytogenetic abnormalities suggestive of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the 11 analyzed patients, 5 died within 6 months after initial ATG treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Six patients, or 54 percent, survived with a minimum follow-up of 24 months and the longest 48 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median survival is 42 months </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The in vitro effect of ATG on pretreatment marrow CFUE was determined in 8 patients and concordance with clinical outcome was observed for only 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three patients had no in vitro response and survived, and 2 patients had a positive in vitro response and died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Survival after ATG correlated with maximum percent decrease in absolute lymphocyte count during treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No significant correlation was determined for any other parameter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The mechanism of ATG action remains unknown but the clinical response suggests that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021053" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">immune dysfunction</z:e> may play an important role in the development or prolongation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, and that this abnormality may be reversible by ATG in some patients </plain></SENT>
