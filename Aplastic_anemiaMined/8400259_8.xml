<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The kinetics of hematopoietic stem cells were investigated in <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e>) heterozygous cats treated with dimethylbusulfan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because of X-chromosome inactivation during embryogenesis, each somatic cell from these animals contains either maternal- or paternal-type G-6-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> hematopoietic progenitor cells carry the G-6-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> phenotype of the most primitive cell (stem cell) from which they originate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For up to 6.5 years after dimethylbusulfan therapy, we determined the percentages of erythroid and granulocyte/macrophage progenitor cells with each G-6-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PD</z:e> phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Significant variations were seen in studies from five of six cats, showing that the population of stem cells contributing to hematopoiesis was neither large nor constant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With mathematical analyses, we estimated that the proliferative potential of residual stem cells was much less than that of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> stem cells reduced in number by autologous transplantation (Abkowitz et al, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 87:9062, 1990) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no evidence for the regeneration of a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> stem cell reserve over time; rather, damage was most pronounced years after dimethylbusulfan exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data may help explain the high clinical incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agent</z:chebi> therapies </plain></SENT>
