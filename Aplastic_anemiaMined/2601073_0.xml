<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> 100 samples showed a logarithmic distribution in EPO concentrations and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range was between 5.4-32.5 mU/ml (mean +/- 2 SD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Coefficient variations (C.V.) of 3 samples continuously assayed were 3.8%, 6.5%, and 9.1% and C.V. of 3 samples assayed day by day were 3.6%, 7.2%, and 11.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Dilution test revealed that 3 samples diluted to 75%, 50%, and 25% were on each line which go through zero point </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After the addition of 5.0, 15.0, and 35.0 mU/ml of EPO to the 3 samples, assay of EPO revealed 95.5 +/- 6.3% (mean +/- SD) of recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Assay of EPO in plasma from 19 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> revealed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> samples were higher than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range and that 4 samples from the patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (less than 8.0 g/dl of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>) showed higher than 3,000 mU/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, 67% (14/21) of samples from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> showed higher than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range in EPO concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>EPO concentration in plasma from 17 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>chronic renal failure</z:hpo> were within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range although the patients showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
