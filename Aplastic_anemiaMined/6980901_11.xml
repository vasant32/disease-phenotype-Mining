<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, the evaluation of lymphocyte function in five patients with this syndrome revealed a number of abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Peripheral blood T lymphocyte percentages as assessed by monoclonal antibodies were decreased in three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>T-helper/T-suppressor cell (OKT4:OKT8) ratios were almost unity in four of the five patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We usually find a ratio of 2:1 in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Studies of lymphocyte-mediated suppression of lymphoproliferation demonstrated an inability to generate concanavalin A-induced suppressor cells in the same four patients and impaired <z:chebi fb="11" ids="26333">prostaglandin</z:chebi>-mediated suppression in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Co-culture studies revealed a T lymphocyte-mediated suppression of erythropoiesis in a single patient, who also showed suppression of the mixed lymphocyte reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The four remaining patients showed no excessive suppressor effects either upon erythropoiesis or lymphoproliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These studies demonstrate that in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004810'>congenital hypoplastic anemia</z:hpo>, the cellular defect is not restricted to the erythroid progenitor cells, but extends to the lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
