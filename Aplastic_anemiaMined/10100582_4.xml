<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Donors began G-CSF (10 microg/kg) injections 1 day after undergoing bone marrow harvest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Blood stem cells were collected on day 5 of G-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Peripheral blood lymphocytes were depleted via CD34-positive selection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>If, after marrow and blood harvest, less than 2.0 x 10(6) CD34 cells/kg were mobilized, leukapheresis was repeated on day 6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median time to an absolute neutrophil count greater than 500 microl was day 10; transfusion-independent platelet count greater than 20,000/microl was day 13; average hospital discharge was day 14; and average inpatient hospital charges were 101,870 US dollars </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> GVHD grade II occurred in five of 13 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No patient developed grade III or IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At a median follow-up of 10 months, no patient has developed extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Allografts of unmanipulated bone marrow supplemented with G-CSF-mobilized and CD34 immunoselected blood cells may prevent an increased risk of GVHD while preserving the rapid engraftment kinetics of peripheral blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Supplementation of marrow with CD34 enriched blood cells appears to result in rapid engraftment, early hospital discharge, lower inpatient charges, decreased regimen-related toxicity, and no apparent increase in GVHD </plain></SENT>
