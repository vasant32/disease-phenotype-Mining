<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In a prospective study, we assessed the role of thyrotropin in the development of the low-<z:chebi fb="4" ids="30660">thyroxine</z:chebi> state that is associated with severe illness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We measured the serum thyrotropin and thyroid hormone concentrations longitudinally in 35 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematopoietic cancer</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> who were treated by bone-marrow transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 19 patients <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30660">thyroxine</z:chebi> declined sharply after bone-marrow transplantation and was associated with a reduction of the serum thyrotropin in the 17 patients tested, often to levels below the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The serum triiodothyronine level, free <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30660">thyroxine</z:chebi> index, and free <z:chebi fb="4" ids="30660">thyroxine</z:chebi> level also declined in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the patients who recovered, clinical improvement was accompanied by the return of thyrotropin and thyroid hormone concentrations to their pretreatment ranges </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These and related findings suggest that the low-<z:chebi fb="4" ids="30660">thyroxine</z:chebi> state of severe illness is the result of several events, one of which is failure of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> negative-feedback control of the pituitary-thyroid axis due to illness-associated, decreased secretion of thyrotropin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The notion that such patients are "euthyroid" must be questioned, but the possible value of thyroid hormone-replacement therapy in these circumstances remains to be determined </plain></SENT>
