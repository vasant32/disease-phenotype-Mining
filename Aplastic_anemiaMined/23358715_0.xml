<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, up to 80% of these patients ultimately relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we review the outcomes of seven patients treated with two cycles and one patient treated with three cycles of HiCY </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The diseases re-treated were <z:hpo ids='HP_0100324'>scleroderma</z:hpo>, multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp>, three patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (SAA), and three patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003473'>myasthenia</z:hpo> gravis (MG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> but two patients with SAA had received standard immunomodulatory therapy for their disease up front and had been refractory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had complete hematologic recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall survival in this cohort was 100% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients relapsed after the initial cycle but event free survival thereafter was 93.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> are still in remission except two MG patients, one of whom relapsed after a severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0687715" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">GI infection</z:e> requiring hospitalization, and the other relapsed 3 years after the second treatment and she did not respond to the third treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This shows that HiCY can be safely re-administered in patients with SAA and refractory SADS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The quality and duration of second remissions appears to be equal or superior to the first remission </plain></SENT>
