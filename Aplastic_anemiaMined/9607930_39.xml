<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the effects on hematopoiesis exerted by sustained <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> replication in the presence of activated T cells, blood values and bone marrow (BM) function were analyzed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024266" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="LCM">lymphocytic choriomeningitis</z:e> virus (LCMV) in perforin-deficient (P0/0) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These mice exhibit a vigorous T cell response, but are unable to eliminate the virus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Within 14 d after <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, a progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> developed that eventually was lethal due to <z:mp ids='MP_0000334'>agranulocytosis</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> correlating with an increasing loss of morphologically differentiated, pluripotent, and committed progenitors in the BM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This hematopoietic disease caused by a noncytopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042769" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">virus infection</z:e> was prevented by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of CD8+, but not of CD4+, T cells and accelerated by increasing the frequency of LCMV-specific CD8+ T cells in T cell receptor (TCR) transgenic (tg) mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>LCMV and CD8+ T cells were found only transiently in the BM of infected <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, increased numbers of CD8+ T cells and LCMV persisted at high levels in antigen-presenting cells of infected P0/0 and P0/0 x TCR tg mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No cognate interaction between the TCR and hematopoietic progenitors presenting either LCMV-derived or self-antigens on the major histocompatibility complex was found, but damage to hematopoiesis was due to excessive secretion and action of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor (TNF)/lymphotoxin (LT)-alpha and interferon (IFN)-gamma produced by CD8+ T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This was studied in double-knockout mice that were genetically deficient in perforin and TNF receptor type 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Compared with P0/0 mice, these mice had identical T cell compartments and T cell responses to LCMV, yet they survived LCMV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and became life-long virus carriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The numbers of hematopoietic precursors in the BM were increased compared with P0/0 mice after LCMV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, although transient <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1533163" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">blood disease</z:e> was still noticed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0543478" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">residual disease</z:e> activity was found to depend on IFN-gamma-producing LCMV-specific T cells and the time point of hematopoietic recovery paralleled disappearance of these virus-specific, IFN-gamma-producing CD8+ T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Thus, in the absence of IFN-gamma and/or TNF/LT-alpha, exhaustion of virus-specific T cells was not hampered </plain></SENT>
