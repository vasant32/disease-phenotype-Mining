<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patient was too old to receive a bone marrow transplantation, and high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi> and antilymphocyte globulin were ineffective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We administered rhG-CSF in combination with metenolone <z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Trilineage blood cell components were recovered 6 months later </plain></SENT>
