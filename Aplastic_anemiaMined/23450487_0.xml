<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Clinical features of 133 patients with successful chromosomal analysis were retrospectively studied, and therapeutic response between patients with and without cytogenetic abnormalities was compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Cytogenetic abnormalities were found in 9 patients, which included <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 (4 cases), <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 (2 cases) and Xq- (1 case), 1q- (1 case) and 7q- (1 case) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No significant difference was detected between patients with or without cytogenetic abnormalities in terms of age (50 vs. 58, P=0.337), sex ratio (male 55.56% vs. 62.10%, female 44.44% vs. 37.90%, P=0.762), or episode of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (44.44% vs. 37.10%, P=0.728) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with cytogenetic abnormalities had a tendency towards poorer rate of therapeutic response, which was however not significantly different from those without (55.56% vs. 79.03%, P=0.116) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the 4 patients with +8 responded to treatment, whilst none of those with -7 or 7q- did </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: No significant difference was found between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> patients with or without cytogenetic abnormalities in terms of clinical features and therapeutic response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 seem to have a favorable response towards treatment </plain></SENT>
