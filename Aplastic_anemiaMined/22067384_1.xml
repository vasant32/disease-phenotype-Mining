<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that the humanized anti-CD52 mAb alemtuzumab might be active in SAA because of its lymphocytotoxic properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated alemtuzumab monotherapy from 2003-2010 in treatment-naive, relapsed, and refractory SAA in 3 separate research protocols at the National Institutes of Health </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Primary outcome was hematologic response at 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For refractory disease, patients were randomized between rabbit ATG + <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> (n = 27) and alemtuzumab (n = 27); the response rate for alemtuzumab was 37% (95% confidence interval [CI], 18%-57%) and for rabbit ATG 33% (95% CI, 14%-52%; P = .78) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 3-year survival was 83% (95% CI, 68%-99%) for alemtuzumab and 60% (95% CI, 43%-85%) for rabbit ATG (P = .16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277556" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">relapsed disease</z:e> (n = 25), alemtuzumab was administered in a single-arm study; the response rate was 56% (95% CI, 35%-77%) and the 3-year survival was 86% (95% CI, 72%-100%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In treatment-naive patients (n = 16), alemtuzumab was compared with horse and rabbit ATG in a 3-arm randomized study; the response rate was 19% (95% CI 0%-40%), and the alemtuzumab arm was discontinued early </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that alemtuzumab is effective in SAA, but best results are obtained in the relapsed and refractory settings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The present trials were registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00195624, NCT00260689, and NCT00065260 </plain></SENT>
