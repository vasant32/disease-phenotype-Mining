<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Because GM-CSF possesses burst-promoting activity (BPA) and megakaryocyte colony-stimulating activity (Meg-CSF) as well as stimulating activity on granulocyte-macrophage progenitors, and erythropoietin (Epo) has thrombopoietin-like activity, the combination therapy of GM-CSF and Epo seems to be more effective for stimulating erythropoiesis and thrombocytopoiesis in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For this reason, the combination therapy of recombinant human GM-CSF (rhGM-CSF) and rhEpo was performed in two patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Epo-unresponsive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> was remarkably improved by adding rhGM-CSF to Epo and the effect lasted for 1 1/2 months in a patient with RA, but severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> occurred again immediately after the discontinuation of Epo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The neutralizing antibodies against GM-CSF were not demonstrated at the phase when <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> re-progressed in this patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In a patient with AA, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, which were refractory to previous administration of rhGM-CSF, responded to the combined administration of GM-CSF and Epo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although the effects were maintained for 3 1/2 months, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> became worse again after the administration of rhGM-CSF was changed from daily to every other day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest the usefulness of combination therapy of GM-CSF and Epo for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
