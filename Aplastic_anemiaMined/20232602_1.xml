<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The production of blood cells from bone marrow (BM) hematopoietic stem cells (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSC</z:chebi>) is regulated by a number of cytokines and growth factors that influence cell survival; differentiation, proliferation and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in health and supposedly, such mechanisms are deregulated in diseased conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As far as cellular kinetics is concerned <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSCs</z:chebi> are relatively quiescent in adults, have the ability to replicate symmetrically and asymmetrically and predictably exhibit multi-lineage hematopoietic reconstitution potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSC</z:chebi> drive hematopoiesis and homeostasis by contracting and expanding the pool of hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In mouse they can be identified immunophenotypically as Sca1+ c-kit cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> a drastic decline in the marrow efficacy to produce mature blood cells leads to <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> hyper stimulated marrow leads to deregulated differentiation of immature hematopoietic stem cells with increased self-proliferation potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In our experimental set up, we induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> by injecting <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> by N-N' <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23995">ethylnitrosourea</z:chebi> intraperitoneally in inbred swiss <z:mp ids='MP_0001189'>albino</z:mp> mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Indeed, <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSCs</z:chebi> and haematopoietic progenitor cells (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HPCs</z:e>) are vulnerable target for such disease oriented dysregulation which bears close correlation with the bone marrow microenvironmental damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The present study aims at evaluating the possible mechanism(s) of deregulation in the bone marrow <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp> with special reference to <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSC</z:chebi> surface receptor expression, cellular granularity, cell cycle status and overall marrow architecture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The investigations made so far revealed an interesting correlation between disease initiation and specific cytokinetic involvement of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSC</z:chebi> in the BM microenvironment with particular reference to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
