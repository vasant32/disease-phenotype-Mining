<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It has previously been shown that patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) have a stem cell defect both of proliferation and differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This has been shown by long-term bone marrow (BM) culture, long-term initiating cell assays, and committed progenitor assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We present, for the first time, data on megakaryocyte (Mk) colony formation from purified BM CD34(+) cells from patients with AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results are compared with those from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls and from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004818'>paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>) and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (MDSs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Those treated for AA had previously received immunosuppression (antithymocyte globulin and/or cyclosporin) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No patients had received bone marrow transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total of 13 AA patients (five untreated, eight treated), six <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>, six <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, and 13 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> donors were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>BM CD34(+) cells were purified by indirect labeling and then cultured in a collagen-based Mk assay kit (MegaCult-C, StemCell Technologies) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The cultures were fixed on day 12, and the Mk colonies were identified by the alkaline phosphatase anti-alkaline phosphatase technique using the monoclonal antibody CD41 (GP IIb/IIIa) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The slides were scored for Mk colony-forming units (CFU-Mks) (3-20 and &gt;20 cells), Mk burst-forming units (BFU-Mks) (&gt;50 cells), and mixed colonies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results show that total Mk colony formation in AA was significantly lower than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> donors (p&lt;0.0001), both in untreated patients/nonresponders to treatment (p = 0.0001) and in complete/partial responders (p&lt;0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in Mk colony formation in treated and untreated patients (p = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Patients with AA had a lower total colony formation than <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> patients (p = 0.0002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> patients exhibited lower colony formation than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (p = 0.03), as shown by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, although the considerable number of variables resulted in a lack of statistically significant difference from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (p = 0.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>We have now shown that Mk colony formation from purified BM CD34(+) cells is significantly reduced, supporting previous evidence that AA results from a stem cell defect </plain></SENT>
