<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutations in genes responsible for telomere maintenance are linked to a number of human diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from 4 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151773" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypocellular bone marrow</z:e> carrying heterozygous mutations in the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) or the telomerase <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> component (TERC) telomerase genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both mutant and control iPSCs upregulated TERT and TERC expression compared with parental fibroblasts, but mutant iPSCs elongated telomeres at a lower rate compared with healthy iPSCs, and the deficit correlated with the mutations' impact on telomerase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no evidence for alternative lengthening of telomere (ALT) pathway activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Elongation varied among iPSC clones derived from the same patient and among clones from siblings harboring identical mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clonal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> was linked to genetic and environmental factors, but was not influenced by residual expression of reprogramming transgenes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>Hypoxia</z:mp> increased telomere extension in both mutant and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> iPSCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Additionally, telomerase-mutant iPSCs showed defective hematopoietic differentiation in vitro, mirroring the clinical phenotype observed in patients and demonstrating that human telomere diseases can be modeled utilizing iPSCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our data support the necessity of studying multiple clones when using iPSCs to model disease </plain></SENT>
