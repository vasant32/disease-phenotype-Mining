<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most cases in the literature occurred within the first year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We present a rare case of a female patient who had a bone marrow transplant for severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (SAA) at the age of two and a half years from her human leukocyte antigen-identical brother </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>She developed a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (refractory cytopenia with multilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>) 12 years later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Initially, the malignant clone was of recipient origin, but within several months, progression to a clinically more aggressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>) was accompanied by the outgrowth of a new clone of donor origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this report we provide evidence proving that the patient's final malignant clone arose in donor cells: cytogenetic analysis of the marrow showed a male karyotype and a t(3;21)(q26;q21) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 62 metaphases analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization showed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> identifiable cells contained the Y chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that donor-cell-derived <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376544" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematopoietic malignancy</z:e> after bone marrow transplantation can occur even after many years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We believe that the 13 years that elapsed between the transplant and the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> in our case represent the longest latency period in the literature </plain></SENT>
