<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results are compared with other known prognostic parameters and with a predictive index formulated from a prior multi-parametric analysis performed in 352 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 47 cases parallel abnormality of Tc and In uptakes was noted and was well correlated with other prognostic factors </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In nine cases, excessive In uptake is explained by dyserythropoiesis associated with granulo- and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> (Fanconi's <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> in most cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 20 of our patients, TcSC uptake was excessive compared with that of In and with other prognostic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Statistically, this phenomenon carries an unfavorable prognosis but its physiological meaning remains to be defined </plain></SENT>
