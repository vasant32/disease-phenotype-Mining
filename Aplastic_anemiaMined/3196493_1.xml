<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>3) Main trunks of the cerebral arteries such as the anterior, the middle, and/or the posterior cerebral arteries are often not or poorly visualized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>4) Its etiology is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It has been known that the occlusion of the internal carotid fork with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya</z:e> vessels is not infrequently seen in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041296" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tb|tbc">tuberculous</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001287'>meningitis</z:hpo>, sickle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, head trauma, and so on </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the definition of the disease, patients with known etiology and/or unilateral occlusion in the carotid fork must be excluded </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We investigated the findings of cerebral computed tomograms in 13 patients who did not fulfil the criteria of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">cerebrovascular Moyamoya disease</z:e>, but revealed the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026654" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MYMY|MYMY1">Moyamoya</z:e> vessels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The subjects are 5 males and 8 females, ranging 15 to 70 years old </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>By angiographic evaluations, occlusions in the unilateral carotid forks were seen in 7 patients, and stenoses in those were in 5 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One patient showed only a severe stenosis in the horizontal portion of the middle cerebral artery.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
