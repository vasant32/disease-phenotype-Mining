<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The application of high-throughput DNA sequencing to the study of rearranged Ig genes now makes this possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The sequencing of thousands of VDJ rearrangements from an individual, either from genomic DNA or expressed <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, should allow their germline IGHV, IGHD, and IGHJ repertoires to be inferred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, where previously mere glimpses of diversity could be gained from sequencing studies, new large data sets should allow the rearrangement frequency of different genes and alleles to be seen with clarity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the DNA of 108,210 human IgH chain rearrangements from 12 individuals and determined their individual IGH genotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The number of reportedly functional IGHV genes and allelic variants ranged from 45 to 60, principally because of variable levels of gene heterozygosity, and included 14 previously unreported IGHV polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>New polymorphisms of the IGHD3-16 and IGHJ6 genes were also seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At heterozygous loci, remarkably different rearrangement frequencies were seen for the various IGHV alleles, and these frequencies were consistent between individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The specific alleles that make up an individual's Ig genotype may therefore be critical in shaping the combinatorial repertoire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The extent of genotypic variation between individuals is highlighted by an individual with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> who appears to lack six contiguous IGHD genes on both chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These deletions significantly alter the potential expressed IGH repertoire, and possibly immune function, in this individual </plain></SENT>
