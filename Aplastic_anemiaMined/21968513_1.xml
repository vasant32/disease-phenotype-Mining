<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> suggests a defect in the ability of hematopoietic stem cells (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSC</z:chebi>) to sustain hematopoieis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have examined the role of the nuclear FA core complex gene Fancg in the functionality of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSC</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In Fancg-/- mice, we observed a decay of long-term <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSC</z:chebi> and multipotent progenitors that account for the reduction in the LSK compartment containing primitive hematopoietic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fancg-/- lymphoid and myeloid progenitor cells were also affected, and myeloid progenitors show compromised in vitro functionality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSC</z:chebi> from Fancg-/- mice failed to engraft and to reconstitute at short and long term the hematopoiesis in a competitive transplantation assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fancg-/- LSK cells showed a loss of quiescence, an impaired migration in vitro in response to the chemokine CXCL12 and a defective homing to the BM after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Finally, the expression of several key genes involved in self-renewal, quiescence and migration of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSC</z:chebi> was dysregulated in Fancg-deficient LSK subset </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Collectively, our data reveal that Fancg should play a role in the regulation of physiological functions of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSC</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
