<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The percentage of Dmin positive patients was 25.0% before HSCT and 25.0-57.1% after HSCT, while <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects were negative for Dmin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mean Dmin of post HSCT patients was 22.7 u in days 501-1000 and 19.3 u after 1001 days, which was significantly lower than the 45.2 u of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients were divided into two groups according to the treatment before HSCT, strongly treated (S, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> and non-Hodgikin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>) and weakly treated (W, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The ratio of Dmin positive patients and mean Dmin in the W group after HSCT (38.9%, 27.8 u), and the S group before and after HSCT (55.6%, 20.5 u and 45.5%, 23.8 u, respectively), were significantly impaired compared with the findings in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (0%, 45.2 u) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean sGrs/Grs count was higher in the W group before HSCT than in the other groups (W before and after HSCT, 0.58 and 0.19, respectively; S before and after HSCT, 0.21 and 0.22, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Taken together, AHR was observed in HSCT patients, particularly for patients in the S group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that high dose chemo-radiotherapy including conditioning regimen causes AHR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mechanisms leading to AHR may be <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, and remodeling of the airway </plain></SENT>
