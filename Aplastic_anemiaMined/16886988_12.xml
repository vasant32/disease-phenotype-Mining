<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To assess the association between exposure to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">antiepileptic</z:chebi> drugs (AEDs) and the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective case-control study was conducted using data from the U.K </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>General Practitioners Research Database (GPRD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cases were defined as patients diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For each case, up to three control patients were matched on age, sex, and medical practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cases and controls were compared with respect to AED use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The effects of duration of AED use were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Characteristics of individual cases with AED use were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The study population comprised 173 cases and 497 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>AED use was more prevalent among cases (9.2%) than among controls (0.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After adjustment for confounders, the use of AEDs was significantly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (adjusted odds ratio (OR), 9.5; 95% confidence interval (CI), 3.0-39.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The most frequently used AEDs were carbamazepine (CBZ), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="39867">valproic acid</z:chebi> (VPA), and phenytoin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The 16 exposed cases were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> with respect to patient and exposure characteristics: the age of these patients varied from 1 to 92 years, and the duration of AED use varied from 17 days to 6.8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that use of AEDs, in particular CBZ and VPA, is associated with a ninefold increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Physicians should be alert to the possibility of AED-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
