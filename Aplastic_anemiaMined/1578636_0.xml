<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The authors report an 18-year-old female who developed severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0235575" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemolytic reaction</z:e> and delayed neutrophil recovery after bone marrow transplantation (BMT) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> from her HLA-identical sibling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>She had received much transfusion (61 units of red blood cells including 4 units of fresh whole blood from her parents and 350 units of platelets) for 12 years before BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To prevent graft rejection, she received an intensified preparative regimen consisted of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> 200 mg/kg followed by 5 Gy total body irradiation and 5 Gy total lymphoid irradiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Prophylaxis for GVHD was short term <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin-A</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Despite of the removal of the red cells from the marrow, marked <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0235575" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemolytic reaction</z:e> caused by antibodies directed to rh" (E) and hr' (c) red cell antigens was observed when rh" (E) and hr' (c) positive donor erythroid began to recover </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The recovery of neutrophils, especially the fraction of segmented cells was also delayed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometry showed that the serially collected patient's sera reacted to neutrophils derived from both patient's blood on the 64th post-transplant day and the donor's blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The reactivity was strongest in pre-BMT sera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that residual antibodies sensitized before BMT are a major cause of these hematological problems </plain></SENT>
