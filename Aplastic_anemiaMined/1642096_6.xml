<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After 10 days of treatment with rHu GM-CSF, the neutrophil and monocyte counts rose to 1.65 x 10(9)/l and 0.41 x 10(9)/l, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the patient was still dependent on erythrocyte and platelet transfusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two days after rHu GM-CSF withdrawal, the neutrophil count dropped off to 0.41 x 10(9)/l.rHu GM-CSF was reinitiated for 2 days along with glucocorticosteroids </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With this combined therapeutic approach, the neutrophil count returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and remained stable, and both Hb and platelet values began to improve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the combination of rHu GM-CSF and glucocorticosteroids can be used as a therapeutic option that may lead to beneficial results in drug-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
