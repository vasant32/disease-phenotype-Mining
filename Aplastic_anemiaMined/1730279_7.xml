<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>5 patients with refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) received long-term administration (2-11 + months) of recombinant human G-CSF (rhG-CSF) in doses from 250-500 micrograms/body/day by intravenous infusion or 75-300 micrograms/body/d by subcutaneous injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 5 evaluable patients showed a substantial increase in absolute neutrophil count (ANC) with a recovery of myeloid components in the bone marrow after 1 to 2 months of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, 2 out of the 5 patients showed a dramatic improvement in severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> after 2 to 4 months of treatment accompanying a recovery of erythroid components in the bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, there was no serious <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> before or during therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Long-term administration of rhG-CSF was well tolerated because of its minimal toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clonal assay revealed a recovery of myeloid progenitors in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients and a recovery of erythroid progenitors in 3 out of the 5 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that long-term administration of rhG-CSF at least mobilizes residual myeloid as well as erythroid progenitor cells and induces a bilineage response in severe refractory AA </plain></SENT>
