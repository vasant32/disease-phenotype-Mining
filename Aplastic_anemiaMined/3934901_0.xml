<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, direct and indirect antiglobulin tests (DAT and IAT) were performed, and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients treated with one type of equine ALG, positive DATs were found in Rh0(D)-positive patients, while the serum of Rh0(D)-negative patients treated with the same ALG reacted in vitro with Rh0(D)-positive erythrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The antibody was eluted and shown to be of equine origin </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Since October 1984, the ALG of this particular source has not displayed any overt anti-erythrocyte activity any more </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> clinicians treating patients with this type of immune immunosuppression should know that ALG may retain human erythrocyte (presumably anti-LW) activity </plain></SENT>
