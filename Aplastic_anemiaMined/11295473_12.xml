<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that matching for HLA-DR may not be more important than matching for HLA-A or HLA-B in selection of a donor for successful BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively analyzed the outcomes of 248 consecutive pediatric patients who received allogeneic BMT from related donors (RD, n = 119) or unrelated donors (URD, n = 129) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HLA-A and HLA-B were serologically matched, and HLA-DRB1 were identical by DNA typing in 69% of donor-recipient pairs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most patients (89%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e>; the rest had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> or a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242354" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">congenital disorder</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One HLA-A antigen mismatch was associated with a decrease in survival (p = 0.003) and a delay in granulocyte engraftment (p = 0.02) in recipients of RD marrow; as well as a decrease in survival (p = 0.02) and the development of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) (p = 0.03) in recipients of URD marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One HLA-B antigen mismatch was associated with a decrease in the survival (p = 0.05) and the development of severe GVHD (p = 0.0007) in recipients of RD marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One HLA-DRB1 allele mismatch was associated only with a decrease in the survival (p = 0.0003) of recipients of RD marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Results of this study suggest that disparity in HLA-A and HLA-B antigens may not be better tolerated than disparity in HLA-DR allele in allogeneic BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further studies are warranted to confirm our results </plain></SENT>
