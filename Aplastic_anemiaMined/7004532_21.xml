<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One major problem with this approach is graft rejection that occurs in 25%-60% of patients conditioned for transplantation with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At most transplant centers it has been difficult to accurately identify patients at high risk for graft rejection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We studied a conditioning regimen of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (200 mg per kg) and low-dose total body irradiation (3 Gy; equivalent to 300 rad) in 23 consecutive unselected patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> followed for a minimum of 6 mo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was only one episode of graft rejection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">Graft-versus-host disease</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006515'>interstitial pneumonitis</z:hpo> were not increased by the more intensive conditioning regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Actuarial survival was 61% at 1 yr and 49% at 2.5 yr </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">Cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> and low-dose total body irradiation is an effective conditioning regimen in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It may be particularly useful when accurate predictive tests of graft rejection are not available as is the case in most transplant centers </plain></SENT>
