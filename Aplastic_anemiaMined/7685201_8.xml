<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In vitro growth of AA BM cells can be improved by the addition of the hematopoietic growth factor SCF (stem cell factor), which suggests that deficiency of SCF may be one of the underlying causes of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we measured the concentration of SCF in sera of patients with severe AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One hundred twenty-eight serum samples from 32 patients, at diagnosis and following therapy, were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Before treatment, SCF levels varied between 0.33 and 6.1 ng/mL; no correlation between hematopoietic function and SCF serum levels was apparent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therapy with antilymphocyte globulin (ALG) or bone marrow transplantation (BMT) did not result in a recognizable pattern of changes in SCF levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, serum concentration of SCF in many patients with AA was at the low range of control serum levels determined in healthy blood donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of 128 AA serum samples tested before and after therapy, 107 were below the mean <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> value of 3.3 ng/mL, including 26 samples below the minimum <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> value of 1.3 ng/mL, as estimated in 267 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We also found that SCF levels in peripheral blood serum correlate well with factor concentrations in the BM plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Clinical observations suggest that higher SCF serum levels are often associated with a better clinical status of the patients in terms of survival and transfusion requirements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The data indicate that a deficient production of soluble SCF may contribute to AA in some patients; thus, suggesting a potential therapeutic benefit of SCF in this disorder </plain></SENT>
