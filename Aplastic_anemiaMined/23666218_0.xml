<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively investigated the status of transfusional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e> at Kinki University Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One hundred and sixty three patients received more than 10 red blood cell (RBC) units per year in 2009 and 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>Myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (37.4%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (11.0%) accounted for about 50% of the underlying diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At the time of receiving a total of 20 RBC units, 90.8% and 66.2% of the 65 patients evaluated had more than 500 and 1,000 ng/ml of serum ferritin, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The frequency of organ dysfunction associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e> was 56.9% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients assessed, 37.8% of patients with serum ferritin levels of 500âˆ¼999 ng/ml, and 67.4% of patients with serum ferritin levels &gt;1,000 ng/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although the Japanese guidelines propose 40 units of RBC transfusion and/or a serum ferritin level of 1,000 ng/ml as a good point to start iron chelation therapy, our results suggest that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e> and consequent organ dysfunction may occur earlier than this </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it may be necessary to start iron chelation therapy earlier than that suggested by the Japanese guidelines </plain></SENT>
