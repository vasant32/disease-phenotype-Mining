<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report the case of a coke plant worker suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Before being hired at the coke plant, he underwent a medical examination including a blood cell count: no disease or abnormalities of the blood crasis were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For 3 years the patient was then exposed to gas containing-as measured in environmental investigation carried out at the coke plant-concentrations of <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> lower than TLV-TWA ACGIH (measured values 21-109 micrograms/m3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the absence from the patient's history of any exposure to other myelotoxic agents and of any earlier pathology causing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, we assume there is a relationship between exposure to low levels of <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, it is very important to consider that exposure to low levels of <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> could promote myelotoxic reactions when the working environment contains other substances that may act synergistically or compete for the same metabolism sites, or when carcinogenic substances are present in the working environment </plain></SENT>
