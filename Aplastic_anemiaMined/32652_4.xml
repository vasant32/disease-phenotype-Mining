<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Transplantation was complicated by transient <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> of moderate severity, which resolved completely following treatment with antithymocyte globulin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The case indicates that patients found to be HLA-D-homozygous may be successfully transplanted from HLA-D-heterozygous sibling donors despite HLA-A and HLA-B incompatibilities, and thus further demonstrates the importance of the HLA-D region as a marker of donor-host histocompatibility </plain></SENT>
