<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: There is growing evidence that immunoablative high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> without stem cell rescue is effective and safe in patients with refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1112570" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">paraneoplastic pemphigus</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, and more recently <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030809" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pemphigus vulgaris</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We report a 51-year-old patient with severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263313" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pemphigus foliaceus</z:e>, which was recalcitrant to multiple medical regimes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patient presented with multiple thick hyperpigmented and scaly, ill-defined plaques on the face </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, she had multiple superficial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_580'>erosions</z:mpath> and crusts on her scalp, thorax, upper and lower extremities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient also had a few discrete intact flaccid bullae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A skin biopsy and direct immunofluorescence was consistent with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263313" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pemphigus foliaceus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patient's circulating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030807" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pemphigus</z:e> autoantibodies were present at a titer of 1 : 2560 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patient received immunoablative high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (50 mg/kg/day) for 4 consecutive days, and tolerated the regime well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Approximately 3 months after therapy, the <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp> had healed and her <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi>, which had been as high as 80 mg daily, was tapered to 30 mg daily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, her circulating autoantibodies decreased after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Nearly 10 months after treatment, the patient did relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0017925" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">her disease</z:e> was less severe and more easily managed with lower doses of immunosuppressive therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This case contributes to the growing evidence of high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>'s efficacy without stem cell rescue in recalcitrant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo>, including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263313" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pemphigus foliaceus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
