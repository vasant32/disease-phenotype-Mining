<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Seventeen patients were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (50 mg/kg for 3 days) followed by thoracoabdominal irradiation (TAI), 6 Gy/1 fr and 2 patients, receiving marrow graft from partially matched family donors, were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (50 mg/kg for 3 days), TAI (6 Gy/1 fr) and Ara-C (4 g/mq for 2 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty-seven more patients were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> alone (50 mg/kg for 4 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received prophylactic treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> (15) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> A (51) to avoid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean time to engraftment was 12 days after chemotherapy and TAI and 15 days after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (Cy) alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No marrow rejections were observed in the TAI group: the two infants that received partially matched marrow allografted and are alive and well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two patients treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> alone rejected allogeneic marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Long-term overall survivals are similar: 64% for TAI + Cy group and 56% for Cy alone group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In spite of the immunosuppressive regimen employed, young patients (under 20 years) do better than older ones (survival: 65% vs 45%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, patient's age seems to be the main factor determining overall survival after allogeneic BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the use of irradiation does not add significantly to the survival of aplastic patients; given the possible toxic long-term effects of irradiation, it would probably be wise to restrict the combined use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> and irradiation to the patients sensitized to their donors, to those receiving partially matched marrow from family donors or in programs involving T-cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
