<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0016037" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva</z:e> is a rare <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic disorder</z:e> of ectopic skeletogenesis associated with dysregulation of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hematopoietic cells have been implicated in the ectopic skeletogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0016037" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva</z:e>, and their replacement has been postulated as a possible cure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the definitive contribution of hematopoietic cells to the pathogenesis of ectopic skeletogenesis remains obscure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We employed both careful clinical observation and in vivo murine transplantation studies to more precisely determine the contribution of hematopoietic cells to ectopic skeletogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We identified a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0016037" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva</z:e> who had undergone bone marrow transplantation for the treatment of intercurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> twenty-five years earlier and investigated whether the clinical course of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0016037" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva</z:e> had been influenced by bone marrow replacement or immunosuppression, or both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In complementary studies, we transplanted hematopoietic stem cells from constitutively expressing LacZ transgenic mice to identify the contribution of hematopoietic cells to BMP4-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011986'>heterotopic ossification</z:hpo>, a histopathologic model of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0016037" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We found that replacement of hematopoietic cells was not sufficient to prevent ectopic skeletogenesis in the patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0016037" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva</z:e> but pharmacologic suppression of the apparently <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> donor immune system following transplantation in the new host modulated the activity of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0016037" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva</z:e> and diminished the expression of skeletal <z:mp ids='MP_0002185'>ectopia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In complementary murine transplantation studies, we found that cells of hematopoietic origin contributed to the early inflammatory and late marrow-repopulating stages of BMP4-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011986'>heterotopic ossification</z:hpo> but were not represented in the fibroproliferative, chondrogenic, or osteogenic stages of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011986'>heterotopic ossification</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, both recombinant human BMP4 induction in an animal model and the dysregulated BMP signaling pathway in a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0016037" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva</z:e> were sufficient to recruit at least two populations of cells, one of hematopoietic origin and at least one of non-hematopoietic origin, that contribute to the formation of an ectopic skeleton </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these findings demonstrate that bone marrow transplantation did not cure <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0016037" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva</z:e> in the patient in this study, most likely because the hematopoietic cell population is not the site, or at least not the dominant site, of the intrinsic dysregulation of the BMP signaling pathway in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0016037" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, following transplantation of bone marrow from a presumably <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> donor, immunosuppression of the immune system appeared to ameliorate activation of ectopic skeletogenesis in a genetically susceptible host </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus, cells of hematopoietic origin may contribute to the formation of an ectopic skeleton, although they are not sufficient to initiate the process alone </plain></SENT>
