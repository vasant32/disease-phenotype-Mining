<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although the therapeutic outcome of acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> has improved markedly with the introduction of immunosuppressive therapy using antithymocyte globulin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi>, a significant proportion of patients subsequently relapse and require second-line therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, detailed analyses of relapses in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> children are limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: We previously conducted two prospective multicenter trials of immunosuppressive therapy for children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>: AA-92 and AA-97, which began in 1992 and 1997, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we assessed the relapse rate, risk factors for relapse, and the response to second-line treatment in children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> treated with antithymocyte globulin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: From 1992 to 2007, we treated 441 children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> with standard immunosuppressive therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among the 264 patients who responded to immunosuppressive therapy, 42 (15.9%) relapsed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cumulative incidence of relapse was 11.9% at 10 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis revealed that relapse risk was significantly associated with an immunosuppressive therapy regimen using <z:chebi fb="1" ids="4315">danazol</z:chebi> (relative risk, 3.15; P=0.001) and non-severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (relative risk, 2.51; P=0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Seventeen relapsed patients received additional immunosuppressive therapy with antithymocyte globulin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Eight patients responded within 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Seven of nine non-responders to second immunosuppressive therapy received hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and five are alive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation directly and seven are alive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, the cumulative incidence of relapse at 10 years was relatively low compared to that in other studies mainly involving adult patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A multicenter prospective study is warranted to establish optimal therapy for children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
