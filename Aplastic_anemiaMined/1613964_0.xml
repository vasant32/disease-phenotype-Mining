<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A combined technique of hemodilution and intraoperative blood salvaging was applied to supplement the blood loss during the operation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Intraoperative monitoring included continuous arterial pressure, heart rate, electrocardiograph, SVO2, <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> time, prothrombin time (PT), activated thromboplastin time (APTT), and thromboelastography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 900 ml of blood was drawn and the same volume of 5% albumin solution was infused over half an hour before the beginning of the surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During the operation, 2100 ml of blood was lost, and 1260 ml of autologous blood, 400 ml of homogeneous red blood cells and 5 units of fresh platelet were infused </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The values of PT, APTT, <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> time were within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ranges after the surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only 3 units of fresh platelet was infused in 2 weeks after the surgery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It was suggested that hemodilution and salvaging autotransfusion is safely performed and beneficial to minimize homogeneous blood transfusion even in a case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
