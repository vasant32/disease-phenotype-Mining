<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> kidney produces EPO to maintain erythrocyte for oxygen supply </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This hormone activity was found in the serum of anemic animals in the 1890s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>Renal failure</z:hpo> results in severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> because of reduced EPO production, therefore <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> patients expected EPO treatment for long time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, this was difficult due to the limited amount of EPO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Many researchers have tried to isolate EPO since the 1950s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally Miyake and Goldwasser purified highly active EPO from the urine of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Since then, the characteristics and structural information from the purified material accelerated the cloning of the EPO gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mammalian cells were essential to produce EPO, because EPO contains 40% carbohydrate that plays some important roles in its activity, stability and biosynthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 1984, two groups succeeded in cloning the EPO gene and expressing this gene in mammalian cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Recombinant human EPO is currently available for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we review production in mammalian cells, molecular characterization, especially carbohydrate moieties, and clinical applications of recombinant EPO </plain></SENT>
