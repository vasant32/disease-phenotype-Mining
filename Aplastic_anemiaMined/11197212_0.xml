<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) is a rare complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we describe 2 patients with severe AA who presented with persistent increases in NK cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Their LGLs were positive for CD56, CD16, and intracellular interferon (IFN)-gamma but negative for CD3, Fas-ligand, and T-cell receptor rearrangement, findings that are compatible with NK cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Not only the number of NK cells, but NK activity as well, was increased in both patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The number of NK cells changed according to hematologic recovery and relapse in 1 case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, there seemed to be a close relationship between NK cells and the progression of AA, at least in this instance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further investigation of the clinical course of similar cases and the characteristics of NK cells is necessary </plain></SENT>
