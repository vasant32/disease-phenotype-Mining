<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>GM-CSF at standard doses (125-500 micrograms/m2) alleviates <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> secondary to cytotoxic chemotherapy, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, but has minimal effect on <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>GM-CSF at doses &lt; 30 micrograms/m2 has been reported to improve platelet counts in some patients exhibiting cytopenia related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521860" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic disorders</z:e> such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seven patients (35%) responded as defined by a reduction in the platelet transfusion requirements by at least 75% </plain></SENT>
