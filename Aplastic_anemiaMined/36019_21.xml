<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two of the patients were autopsied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among these, the lesion was found in seven of 11 in whom a graft-versus-host reaction developed but in none of the 11 without such a reaction who had received similar pretransplant immunosuppression (P less than 0.025) </plain></SENT>
