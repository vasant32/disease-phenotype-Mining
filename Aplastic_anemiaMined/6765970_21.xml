<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Before transplantation, about one-third to one-half of the patients were deficient in cytotoxic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, this was most likely due to large numbers of circulating blast cells diluting or replacing the effector cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> there was an apparent absence of the effector cells in a proportion of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After marrow transplantation, cytotoxic activity in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three systems returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> rapidly, by 30 days, and remained so through 100 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, about 20% of patients studied beyond 1 year were deficient in these functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no significant associations between cytotoxic activity and important clinical parameters including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-vs-host disease</z:e>, and recurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our findings do not support an immunosurveillance role for NK against <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> after marrow transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, they point out the need for new in vitro approaches for meaningful monitoring of marrow transplant patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Finally, our results showed a significant discordance between NK, ADCC, and LDCC activities in these immunologically perturbed individuals, indicating that either different cell populations or different cellular mechanisms are involved in these cytotoxic functions </plain></SENT>
