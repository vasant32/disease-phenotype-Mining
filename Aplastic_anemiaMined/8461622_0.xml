<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To clarify the role of growth factors in the pathophysiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> we measured serum granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) levels in 33 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> patients by a specific and sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>GM-CSF serum levels of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> were significantly higher than in healthy volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>GM-CSF levels were correlated with the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> but not with the absolute neutrophil count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Since T lymphocytes are one of the main sources of GM-CSF, our data provide further evidence for in vivo T lymphocyte activation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>GM-CSF serum levels are higher in patients responding to immunosuppressive treatment than in nonresponders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Elevated serum GM-CSF might be predictive of a good response to immuno-suppressive therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>GM-CSF serum levels are lower immediately after treatment with antilymphocyte globulin/antithymocyte globulin (ALG/ATG) than corresponding pretreatment values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus we cannot confirm the hypothesis that ALG/ATG effects in vivo are mediated by stimulating the release of growth factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> the primary defect is a failure in GM-CSF response rather than in GM-CSF supply </plain></SENT>
