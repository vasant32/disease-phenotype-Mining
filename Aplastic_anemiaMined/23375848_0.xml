<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001882'>Leukopenia</z:hpo> is often associated with systemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024138,C0024141,C0024131,C0409974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lupus</z:e> erythematous (SLE) and other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, homeostatic proliferation of T cells, which is a host response to T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001888'>lymphopenia</z:hpo>, has been implicated as potential cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> (RA) in human and experimental models of autoimmune <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">NOD</z:e> mice and the BB rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Conversely, successful treatments of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> by immune suppression suggest that the hematologic abnormality may have a root in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Traditionally, the link between <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> and defects in hematopoietic cells has been viewed from the prism of antibody-mediated hemolytic cytopenia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>While autoimmune destruction may well be part of pathogenesis of defects in hematopoietic system, it is worth considering the hypothesis that either <z:hpo ids='HP_0001882'>leukopenia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> may also result directly from defective hematopoietic stem cells (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSC</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We have recently tested this hypothesis in the autoimmune Scurfy mice which has mutation Foxp3, the master regulator of regulatory T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data demonstrated that due to hyperactivation of mTOR, the <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSC</z:chebi> in the Scurfy mice are extremely poor in hematopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">rapamycin</z:chebi>, an mTOR inhibitor rescued <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSC</z:chebi> defects and prolonged survival of the Scurfy mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our data raised the intriguing possibility that targeting mTOR dysregulation in the <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSC</z:chebi> may help to break the vicious cycle between cytopenia and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
