<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Marrow samples from 89 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) were evaluated for their ability to grow stromal layers in standard long-term marrow cultures (LTMCs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Results were highly variable: 6.8% failed to grow any stromal cells (group I); 42.5% either failed to grow to confluency or appeared to have a decreased number of adipocytes and/or macrophages (group II); and 52.8% appeared as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> confluent cultures with fibroblasts, adipocytes, and macrophages (group III) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Analyses of patient data suggested that group I patients had a longer disease duration and poorer survival (P = .07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay analysis of cytokine production was performed on 20 of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-appearing AA LTMCs and 12 LTMCs established from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Significant differences between the AA and control groups were apparent for macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha (MIP-1 alpha), interleukin-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> (IL-1ra), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-inhibitory factor (LIF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most dramatic differences observed were elevated levels of MIP-1 alpha and GM-CSF and decreased levels of IL-1ra, particularly after IL-1 alpha stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, IL-1 alpha stimulation of AA LTMCs produced levels of IL-6, LIF, and G-CSF comparable with those of controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that defects exist within the microenvironment of some AA marrows </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Whether the majority of these defects are the cause or consequence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> is not clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, we speculate that some of these abnormalities may contribute to the maintenance of the hypoplastic state and, in extreme cases, prevent engraftment of donor marrow </plain></SENT>
