<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD was seen in 47% of the patients; however, no direct correlation between GVHD and the degree of mismatching could be determined </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the problems encountered in this pilot study can potentially be solved, and that further studies with this type of marrow grafting are warranted </plain></SENT>
