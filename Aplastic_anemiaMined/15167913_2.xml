<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The efficacy of immunosuppressive therapy in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) provides the strongest argument to support its immune-mediated pathophysiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While several immunosuppressive effects of antithymocyte globulin (ATG) can be demonstrated in vitro, some reports have implied that the activity of ATG in AA may be rather due to a variety of positive hematopoietic effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied the effects of horse (h) and rabbit (r) ATG on marrow progenitors in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both types of ATG bound to CD34 cells and, in colony assays performed with total marrow cells, hATG had a dose-dependent, triphasic effect, with maximal increase in colony formation between 1 and 10 microg/ml and inhibition between 100 and 1000 microg/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As determined using CD34 cells, these effects did not require accessory cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>rATG showed similar activity, but was about 10-fold more potent than hATG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the presence of complement, no increased cytotoxicity was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At concentrations equivalent to those measured in patients immediately after infusion, ATG showed moderate suppression of colony formation, while the stimulatory concentrations in vitro correspond to those seen in vivo within the first weeks after ATG administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In control experiments, the patterns of the biologic effects of preimmune rIgG or hIgG preparations were similar to those of rATG and hATG, indicating a nonspecific nature of the effects of ATG on progenitor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Biological activity in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53448">methylcellulose</z:chebi> cultures was observed with the F(ab)(2) fragments but was not found in purified Fc IgG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In summary, the spectrum of effects of ATG on hematopoietic progenitors is dependent upon the concentrations of ATG and may not be related to its antigenic specificity </plain></SENT>
