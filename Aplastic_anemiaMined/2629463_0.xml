<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of the 152 patients with SAA, 109 were alive between 2 and 132 months following transplantation and the probability of survival at 5 years was 70% (for the patients with grafts from HLA-matched siblings) and 100% (for the patients with grafts from monozygous twins) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Survival rate at 3 years for the patients with grafts from family members other than HLA-matched siblings was 46% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The chance of survival was influenced by conditioning regimen and recipient's age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Recipients with sustained engraftment had a significantly higher survival rate than those with graft failure (83% vs 11%, p less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Since 1985, the results of transplantation from HLA-matched siblings have improved and the 3-year survival is more than 90% for patients under 20 years old </plain></SENT>
