<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study demonstrated that ATG induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and reduced proliferation in both cell lines and primary leukemic cells, particularly in lymphatic origin cells, indicating that ATG has broad-spectrum antileukemic activity, especially for cells of lymphatic origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Polyclonal ATGs are currently used to prevent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> in allogeneic stem cell transplantation patients and to treat patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It contains antibodies against antigens expressed on various hematopoietic cells, we hypothesized that it induces cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> not only in healthy cells but also in malignant hematopoietic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, several human leukemic cell lines and primary leukemic cells from 15 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> were used to investigate the ability of polyclonal ATGs to induce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Polyclonal ATGs induced cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in primary leukemic cells and in cell lines in a dose-dependent manner, and induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in different populations through a variety of targets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cell proliferation was significantly reduced in the presence of polyclonal ATGs; it arrested cells in the G0-G1 phase by cell cycle analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment with polyclonal ATGs plus complement increased cytolysis of the leukemic cells; complement augments polyclonal ATG-induced leukemic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These data show that polyclonal ATG has broad-spectrum antileukemic activity, especially for cells of lymphatic origin, as it induced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> through a variety of targets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This study provides an experimental basis for the application of polyclonal ATGs in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and in patients with lymphatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
