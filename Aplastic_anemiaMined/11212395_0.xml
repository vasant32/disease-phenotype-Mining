<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The examination was performed on postmortem sections from 10 pediatric cases (the average age of 9.5 years) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010674" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">mucoviscidosis</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> treated before the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> for up to 12 months with ciprofloxacin in a dose of 20 to 40 mg/kg body weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The control postmortem sections were from 10 practically healthy children (the average age of 10.4 years) killed in a car accident </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The sections were subjected to 2-stage dry ashing with ionometric determination of the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="24061,30236">fluorine</z:chebi> ions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results were treated according to the V.Yu </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023795" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Urbach</z:e> procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It was shown that the content of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="24061,30236">fluorine</z:chebi> in the sponge bone and process zone in both the groups did not significantly differ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A comparatively high content of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="24061,30236">fluorine</z:chebi> was detected only in the postmortem sections of the articular cartilage from the children of the main group who however had no chondrotoxic symptoms while alive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>That means that the difference is statistically and clinically insignificant </plain></SENT>
