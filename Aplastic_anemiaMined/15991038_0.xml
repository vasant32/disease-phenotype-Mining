<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To report a case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> in a patient treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16698">cyanamide</z:chebi>, an alcohol-aversive drug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 67-year-old man was admitted to hospital because of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>He had taken <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16698">cyanamide</z:chebi> for 6 months as an alcohol deterrent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No other risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> were identified by interviewing the patient using a structured validated questionnaire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results of bone-marrow biopsy showed severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="16698">Cyanamide</z:chebi> was discontinued and the patient was treated according to a prespecified treatment protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One year after hospital admission, the patient was completely recovered with no need of immunosuppressive therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An objective causality assessment revealed that an adverse drug reaction was probable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: As the efficacy of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16698">cyanamide</z:chebi> has been questioned, due to the failure of various trials to show any benefit over placebo, its overall benefit/risk ratio should be reconsidered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The complete and rapid hematological recovery after discontinuation of the drug, and the absence of other factors that could explain the condition support the association of the present case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16698">cyanamide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mechanism remains unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>Aplastic anemia</z:hpo> is a rare but potentially serious adverse drug effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16698">cyanamide</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Given the poor evidence on the efficacy of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16698">cyanamide</z:chebi> and the associated risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, its use in reducing alcohol consumption should be reconsidered </plain></SENT>
