<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Infections</z:e> were classified as microbiologically defined and clinically defined <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> in 8 and 7 episodes, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Before the GTX transfusions, broad-spectrum antibacterial and antifungal therapy had been administered for a median of 12 (range 5-28) and 8 days (range 2-50), respectively, with no improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>G-CSF was administered prior to GTX in 9 episodes of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, with a median of 9 days of treatment (range 4-30) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Leukapheresis was obtained from 15 related donors (father, 10; mother, 3; sister, 1; aunt, 1) after s.c. stimulation with G-CSF, 300 micro g daily, starting from day -3 (where day 0 was the day of the first granulocyte collection) and continuing throughout the period of GTX treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The donors' median white blood cell (WBC) count at leukapheresis was 31.6 x 10(9)/l (range 12-56), and the median yield was 31.39 x 10(9) WBC (range 2.96-64.73 x 10(9)), with a proportion of PMN of 90-95% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall, 70 GTX were administered, with a median of 4 GTX per episode of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> (range 2-11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The combination of GTX with antimicrobial therapy led to complete or partial recovery in 6 and in 3 of 15 episodes (60%), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Priming of the donor with G-CSF was well tolerated, the most common side-effects being <z:hpo ids='HP_0002653'>bone pain</z:hpo>, malaise and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003401'>paresthesia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> donors are alive and well after a median of 4.5 years (range 0.8-7.7) from donation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that GTX is potentially useful when the severity of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and the host's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> make any other antimicrobial treatment ineffectual </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Long-term safety data on the stimulation of donors with G-CSF have been reassuring to date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Further controlled studies are needed to assess the exact role of GTX in the outcome of neutropenic patients with severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and any criteria for patient selection and the timing of GTX administration </plain></SENT>
