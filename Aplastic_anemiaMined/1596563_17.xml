<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have used the long-term bone marrow culture (LTBMC) system to analyze hematopoiesis in three patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0009563'>dyskeratosis</z:mp> congenita (DC), two of whom had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, and the third had a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> blood count (apart from mild <z:mp ids='MP_0000248'>macrocytosis</z:mp>) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> BM cellularity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hematopoiesis was severely defective in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three patients, as measured by a low incidence of colony-forming cells and a low level of hematopoiesis in LTBMC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The function of the marrow stroma was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in its ability to support the growth of hematopoietic progenitors from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> marrows seeded onto them in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three cases, but the generation of hematopoietic progenitors from patients marrow cells inoculated onto <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> stromas was reduced, thus suggesting the defect to be of stem cell origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The parents and unaffected brother of one of the families have also been studied in LTBMC and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hematopoietic and stromal cell function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>From this study we speculate that there are some similarities between DC and the defect in the W/Wv mouse </plain></SENT>
