<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: One hundred and six cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> patients were treated by SEC and the pathological change of bone marrow were observed before and after treatment for 24 months, and compared with 17 cases of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteers as control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The total effective rate was 77.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The degree of marrow <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> (15.7 +/- 10.2 vol% vs 39.2 +/- 13.9 vol%), the percentage of the granulocytes (31.4 +/- 12.4% vs 39.9 +/- 10.4%), the erythroblastes (19.8 +/- 15.9% vs 36.7 +/- 13.5%), megakaryocytes (1.4 +/- 2.3 cell/section vs 24.0 +/- 24.6 cells/section), and the microvessel number (40.0 +/- 23.4 ves/100 mm2 vs 201.0 +/- 141.0 ves/100 mm2) ascended significantly (P &lt; 0.01 or P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: SEC could not only irritate the hematopoiesis, but also exert reconstructive action to marrow microenvironment </plain></SENT>
