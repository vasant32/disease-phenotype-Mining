<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Seventeen were men and 12 were women, ranging in age from 15 to 67 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Based on the results of oral <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test, the patients were divided into three groups: 14 previously treated cases with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance; eight previously treated cases with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001952'>abnormal glucose tolerance</z:hpo>, of whom six had <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> and two had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>impaired glucose tolerance</z:hpo>; and seven newly diagnosed cases with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>Hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> were observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analyses show that sex, age, body mass index, previous <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> therapy, previous blood transfusion, initial <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> and white blood cell and serum ferritin concentrations were not significantly related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000842'>hyperinsulinemia</z:hpo> as expressed by the integrated insulin area under the curve of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients in the second group who had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001952'>abnormal glucose tolerance</z:hpo> had a delay in insulin secretion in response to <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi>, indicating a deterioration of insulin reserve in the beta cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients in this group were significantly older at the time of diagnosis than those in the first group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No other determinants of the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001952'>abnormal glucose tolerance</z:hpo> were demonstrated </plain></SENT>
