<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received 5 doses of ATG every other day in a 60-min intravenous infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Five peripheral blood immunoregulatory mononuclear cell (MNC) subsets, defined by monoclonal antibodies, were enumerated before and 24 h after each application of ATG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Following the first dose of ATG there was a significant and transient reduction in the absolute number of helper T lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no statistically significant difference pre-ATG to post-ATG in the absolute number of MNC expressing activation antigen Tac (interleukin-2 receptor) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, Tac+ cells, which were significantly increased before ATG therapy, decreased to nearly <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels after the fourth dose of ATG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A significant and sustained increment in the absolute number of monocytes (CD14+ cells) occurred following the third dose of ATG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The absolute numbers of MNC, suppressor T lymphocytes and cells bearing HLA-DR antigen remain without significant change along ATG treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that: (a) Tac+ cells are probably involved in the pathogenesis of AA; (b) the target of ATG may be a Tac+ cell, and (c) ATG may stimulate monopoiesis </plain></SENT>
