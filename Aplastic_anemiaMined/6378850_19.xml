<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In preparation for transplantation, 96 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> were conditioned with chemotherapy only, usually <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> 50 mg/kg X 4 intravenously, while 181 patients (two with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and 179 with a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancy</z:e>) were conditioned with a regimen of total body irradiation (TBI) and chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>TBI was delivered from two opposing 60Co sources at an exposure rate of 4 to 8 cGy/min, either as a single dose of 10 Gy (105 patients) or in fractions (76 patients), usually at increments of 2 to 2.25 Gy/day for 6 to 7 days for cumulative doses of 12 to 15.75 Gy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To date, 86 patients have developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000518'>cataracts</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Kaplan-Meier product limit estimates of the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000518'>cataracts</z:hpo> for patients given chemotherapy only and no TBI, single-dose TBI, and fractionated TBI are 19, 80, and 18%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the basis of proportional hazards regression analyses, patients given single-dose TBI had a relative risk of developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0000518'>cataracts</z:hpo> that was 4.7-fold higher than in patients given fractionated TBI or chemotherapy only (p less than 0.00005), suggesting a significant sparing effect with use of TBI dose fractionation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Addition significant risk factors included the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> use of steroids posttransplant (highly associated with the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e>), and the diagnoses of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphoblastic or <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
