<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow aspirates from 75 patients with MDSs and 18 with AA were fixed in 95% <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> solution or 10% neutral formalin and stained with the Papanicolaou method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>BCHNs were detected in 57 of 75 patients with MDSs and in 10 of 18 AA patients </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The proportion of BCHNs increased with disease progression in these 16 of 17 patients with MDSs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The presence of BCHNs at <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and the increase in proportion of BCHNs during the clinical course of MDSs were significant indications for predicting disease progression </plain></SENT>
