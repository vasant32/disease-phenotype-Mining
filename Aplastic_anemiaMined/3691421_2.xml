<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Appropriate use of carbamazepine for the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014544" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">epilepsy</z:e> is based on correct identification of the patient's <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Carbamazepine is effective against <z:hpo ids='HP_0007359'>partial seizures</z:hpo> and against <z:hpo ids='HP_0002069'>generalized tonic clonic seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therapy should begin gradually, with initial doses increased slowly over 1 or 2 weeks, as tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Side effects include <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp>, dizziness, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000651'>double vision</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002018'>nausea</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most practitioners agree that, because of carbamazepine's relatively short half-life, the total dosage should be administered in at least two divided doses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This avoids too high a peak blood level that would occur with a single dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Carbamazepine therapy is associated with the development of two hematologic conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001882'>Leukopenia</z:hpo>, which may be transient or persistent, requires careful monitoring but is not cause for immediate discontinuation of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>Aplastic anemia</z:hpo> occurs rarely but is potentially fatal, and therefore diligent monitoring of hematologic function is indicated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>Aplastic anemia</z:hpo> is an idiosyncratic, non-dose-related side effect that is most likely to occur within the first 3 or 4 months of initiating therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Once <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> are controlled, plasma levels of carbamazepine should be measured to establish optimum levels for individual patients being treated with this drug </plain></SENT>
