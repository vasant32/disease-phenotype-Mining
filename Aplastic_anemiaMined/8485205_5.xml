<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEpo) was administered to 14 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and seven patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 19 patients, doses of 6000 units were given intravenously three times a week (t.i.w.) with the dose being doubled up to 24,000 units every 8 weeks until a response was obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RhEpo was given subcutaneously in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seven patients, four with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and three with AA, showed a significant response with an increase of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> concentration during therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The response occurred at doses of 12,000 units in five and 24,000 units in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Responding patients with both <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and AA had a relatively low serum Epo (s-Epo) level prior to Epo therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> responders had either <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA) or RA with ring sideroblasts (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RARS</z:e>), while two of the Epo responders in AA had a severe form of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, since some of the Epo responders had a high initial s-Epo concentration, a high s-Epo level does not preclude the use of rhEpo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Serial determination of s-Epo levels showed a progressive decline in six of the seven responders even when they were on rhEpo therapy, while the s-Epo levels remained elevated or further increased with time in most nonresponders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RhEpo was well tolerated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that rhEpo is a safe and effective treatment for a certain proportion of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Moreover, serial determination of s-Epo during therapy may be useful in monitoring and predicting the therapeutic effect of rhEpo </plain></SENT>
