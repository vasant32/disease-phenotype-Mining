<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients in each group received antilymphocyte globulin (ALG) for IST, and eight patients in each group received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> (CSA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Complete remission rates at one year were 26% and 74% for group I and group II patients, respectively </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared with patients receiving ALG alone, patients treated with ALG plus HGFs had significantly better one-year survival (100% vs. 54.5%, P &lt; 0.05), complete remission rates (91% vs. 36%, P &lt; 0.05), more rapid and complete hematologic recovery, greater reductions in transfusion requirements, and lower <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The data suggest a potential role for rhEPO + rhGM-CSF therapy in SAA patients receiving IST </plain></SENT>
