<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In this study we retrospectively evaluated the effect and outcome of a boost dose of donor stem cells without additional chemotherapy or total body irradiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Between March 1983 and August 1999, 20 of 788 (2.5%) patients receiving allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) were treated with an additional boost dose of donor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The reasons for the use of the boost treatment were primary graft failure (early rejection; n = 7), secondary graft failure including late rejection (n = 10), refractory pure red cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> caused by the remaining recipient cells producing anti-erythrocyte antibodies (n = 2), and donor lymphocyte infusion induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients were aged from 17 to 48 years (median age 31 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The underlying diseases of the patients were severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> in 12 patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> in 3, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> in 3, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> in 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The donors were human leukocyte antigen-identical siblings in 18 cases, 1 mismatched related donor, and 1 unrelated donor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cell source was bone marrow in 6 cases and peripheral blood progenitor cells in 14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median interval between BMT and the boost treatment was 7 weeks (range 1-124) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No conditioning regimen was given prior to the boost treatment for 11 patients, while 4 received total nodal irradiation (TNI) plus antithymocyte globulin (ATG), 3 ATG alone, and 2 TNI plus steroid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The median infused booster mononuclear cell dose was 2.55 x 10(8)/kg (range 0.28-37.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Fifteen (75%) patients achieved a hematological recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>After the boost treatment, 6 of 20 (30%) patients developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) &gt; or = grade II, 3 of whom had had prior GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Five (31.3%) of the evaluable 16 patients developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The GVHDs were easily controlled using <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressive agents</z:chebi> except in the case of 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Five patients died after the boost treatment; 2 within 30 days, 2 within 60 days, and 1 after 32 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were: 3 engraftment failures, 1 late rejection, and 1 infection following GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up of 31.5 months (range 6-92), the Kaplan-Meier method estimated that the overall survival rate 1 and 3 years after the boost treatment was 80 and 71%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The survival of patients with primary graft failure was determined to be significantly lower compared to that of patients with secondary graft failure, using the log rank test (p = 0.0176) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Disease category, stem cell source, conditioning prior to a boost treatment, and year of boost treatment did not have an influence on survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the reinfusion of donor stem cells is frequently successful in achieving engraftment with rare occurrence of fatal GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, relatively good long-term survival was demonstrated </plain></SENT>
