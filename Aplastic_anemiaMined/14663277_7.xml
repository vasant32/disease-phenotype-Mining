<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Pearson bone marrow-pancreas syndrome (PS) is a rare, usually fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> disorder involving the hematopoietic system in early infancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Due to the diversity of clinical symptoms, the diagnosis can be difficult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors describe a boy with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001908'>hypoplastic anemia</z:hpo> in whom extensive clinical, biochemical, and morphologic findings led to the diagnosis of PS, and molecular analysis revealed a novel deletion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> DNA from nucleotide position 10.371 to 14.607 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The patient is a 2-year-old boy who presented at age 5 months with hypoplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001972'>macrocytic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>His first months of life and the family history were uneventful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Extensive pretransfusion evaluations did not reveal a metabolic, infectious, or hematologic-neoplastic etiology, and he had no evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001738'>exocrine pancreatic insufficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, a second bone marrow aspirate at age 7 months showed a <z:mp ids='MP_0000329'>reduced cell number</z:mp>, vacuolated erythroblasts and myeloblasts, and ringed sideroblasts, so PS was suspected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Additional molecular analysis from the boy's blood leukocytes revealed a deletion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> DNA from nucleotide position 10.371 to 14.607, which was absent in his mother's blood cells, consistent with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> mutation as commonly seen in PS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The muscle histology and the respiratory chain enzymes were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Mitochondriopathies should be considered in children with persistent non-neuromuscular symptoms such as unexplained <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Due to the often-fatal course of PS, the rapid detection of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> DNA deletions is imperative for diagnosis and family counseling </plain></SENT>
