<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To clarify the role of transferrin receptors in cases of altered iron metabolism in clinical pathological conditions, we studied: number of binding sites; affinity; and recycling kinetics of transferrin receptors on human erythroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since transferrin receptors are mainly present on erythroblasts, the number of surface transferrin receptors was determined by assay of binding of 125I-transferrin and the percentage of erythroblasts in bone marrow mononuclear cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The number of binding sites on erythroblasts from patients with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0001891'>iron deficiency anemia</z:hpo> was significantly greater than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects (p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among those with an <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001878'>hemolytic anemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001901'>polycythemia</z:hpo> vera compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects, there were no considerable differences in the numbers of binding sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The dissociation constants (Kd) were measured using Scatchard analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The apparent Kd was unchanged (about 10 nmol/L) in patients and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The kinetics of endocytosis and exocytosis of 125I-transferrin, examined by acid treatment, revealed no variations in recycling kinetics among the patients and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that iron uptake is regulated by modulation of the number of surface transferrin receptors, thereby reflecting the iron demand of the erythroblast </plain></SENT>
