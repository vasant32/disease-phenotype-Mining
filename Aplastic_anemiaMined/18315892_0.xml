<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As the feedback, the results from lab investigations inserted into clinical practice and eventually made a quick modernization of hematology, which was actually a good model for the "translational research" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The past few decades have witnessed tremendous advances in our understanding of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hematopoiesis where genes dictate, epigenetics regulate, transcription factors mediate, and stem cells self-renew and differentiate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Dissection of disease pathogenesis not only elucidates molecular basis of disorders including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019045" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemoglobinopathy</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0684275,C0019069" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemophilia</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376544" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematopoietic malignancies</z:e> such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorders</z:hpo>, but also provides therapeutic targets for drug development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Introduction of targeted therapies and combinatory targeting therapies greatly benefits hundreds of thousands of patients, and even turns <z:hpo ids='HP_0004836'>acute promyelocytic leukemia</z:hpo> from highly fatal to highly curable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the 21st century the experimental hematology is entering the era of genomics and system biomedicine, and the pace of progress extrapolates to a prediction of hematologic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> control in this century </plain></SENT>
