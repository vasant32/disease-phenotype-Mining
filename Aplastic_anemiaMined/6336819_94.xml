<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the efficacy of antithymocyte globulin for the treatment of moderate to severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> in a randomized controlled study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eleven of 21 patients initially randomized to receive antithymocyte globulin (given intravenously on eight consecutive days) had sustained improvement in hematopoiesis within three months of treatment; none of 21 control patients who received supportive care alone improved (P = 0.0005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Six of 12 control patients who subsequently received antithymocyte globulin improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Responders had gradual improvement in hematopoiesis, but none recovered completely <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> peripheral-blood counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone-marrow failure</z:hpo>, age, cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, and transfusion history had no apparent bearing on treatment outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The interval from diagnosis to antithymocyte globulin treatment correlated inversely with the chance of a treatment response, although this correlation was not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that antithymocyte globulin is effective in improving hematopoiesis in some patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
