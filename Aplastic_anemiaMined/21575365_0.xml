<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To study the regulatory effect of thymosin α1 (Tα1) on immunosuppression of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) through Toll-like receptor 9(TLR9)and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) signaling pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Bone marrow T cell subsets from children with AA and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals were measured by using flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Expressions of TLR9/IDO <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> of MSCs cocultured with Tα1 were determined by reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Inhibition of PHA-activated T cell proliferation and activation by MSCs cocultured with Tα1 was detected by using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> assay and flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULT: CD4(+)/CD8(+) ratio (0.64 ± 0.02) in children with AA was significantly lower than that in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals (1.42 ± 0.05); but CD8(+)/CD38(+) ratio (0.92 ± 0.04) was significantly higher than that in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals (0.65 ± 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>AA MSCs obviously expressed TLR9, but not IDO; AA MSCs treated with Tα1 downregulated TLR9 expression but upregulated IDO expression in concentration- and time-dependent manners </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The inhibition of AA MSCs on T cell proliferation (21.38% ± 12.34%) was lower than that in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals (62.72% ± 17.79%, P &lt; 0.05), while AA MSCs treated with Tα1 for 18 h exhibited a stronger inhibition (42.83% ± 16.54%, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The immunosuppression mediated by MSCs could be improved by Tα1 through upregulation of IDO expression via TLR9-dependent signaling pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This research provides a new idea for targeted immunomodulatory therapy with bone marrow MSCs from children with AA </plain></SENT>
