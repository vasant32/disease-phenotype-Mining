<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The proportion of skin fibroblasts expressing SV40 T-antigen by immunofluorescent methods was elevated in 12 patients with Fanconi <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> and in seven of nine obligate heterozygous relatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Elevated expression was also observed in three patients with other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0947743,C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematological disorders</z:e> at high risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> non-lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, but was not apparent in seven <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> patients or four of their relatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>T-antigen expression was elevated in about one-half of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003974'>absent radius</z:hpo> syndrome and related conditions, with familial <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, and in their <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> relatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the conditions under study, elevated T-antigen expression seemed clearly correlated with predisposition to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, which may be genetically determined, but it was not associated with cytogenetic or anemic manifestations </plain></SENT>
