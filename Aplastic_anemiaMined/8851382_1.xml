<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three hundred and two strains were isolated from 287 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifty two point three percent of the total isolates were <z:mp ids='MP_0001795'>gram-negative</z:mp> bacilli, 26.8% were <z:mp ids='MP_0001796'>gram-positive</z:mp> cocci, 17.2% were fungi and 3.6% were anaerobic bacteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In ALL patients <z:mp ids='MP_0001796'>gram-positive</z:mp> cocci accounted for 42.0% </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Forty-seven point two percent of organisms which caused <z:mpath ids='MPATH_681'>septicemia</z:mpath> in ALL patients were isolated from surveillance cultures of the throat just before the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_681'>septicemia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data suggested that in ALL cases microbiological organisms more frequently invaded through injuries of oral mucosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In ATL, <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>, MM and AA patients, fungi accounted for more than 25% of causative organisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The most common organism of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the strains was Pseudomonas aeruginosa (21.9%), but in ATL and MM patients Escherichia coli was more common than P. aeruginosa </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>According to the mortality of each causative organisms, fungal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_681'>septicemia</z:mpath> had a terribly high mortality of 82.9% while other <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> mortality was about 20% </plain></SENT>
