<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Although <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17698">chloramphenicol</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50845">doxycycline</z:chebi> have been used for the treatment of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036472" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">scrub typhus</z:e>, a difficulty exists in determining which drug to use in treating children because of such potential complications as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> or tooth discoloration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32109">roxithromycin</z:chebi>, a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25105">macrolide antibiotic</z:chebi>, on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036472" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">scrub typhus</z:e> in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 39 children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036472" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">scrub typhus</z:e> who were treated with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50845">doxycycline</z:chebi> (DC), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17698">chloramphenicol</z:chebi> (CM) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32109">roxithromycin</z:chebi> (RM) between 1991 and 2000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We divided the patients into the DC-treated group (DC group; 16 children), CM-treated group (CM group; 14 children) and RM- treated group (RM group; 9 children) and compared these groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Most cases (97%) occurred in October and November </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>Fever</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015230" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rash</z:e> were observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 39 cases, and an eschar was noted in 36 cases (92%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No statistical differences could be found between the 3 groups in mean age, duration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> before admission, white blood cell (WBC) count and complications including <z:hpo ids='HP_0002910'>abnormal liver enzymes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In most cases defervescence after treatment was within 24 h (34 cases, 87%) and during 24 to 48 h in 2 cases in the DC group, 1 case in the CM group and 2 cases in the RM group (no statistical difference) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32109">Roxithromycin</z:chebi> was as effective as conventional <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50845">doxycycline</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17698">chloramphenicol</z:chebi> in children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036472" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">scrub typhus</z:e> and may be safer to use </plain></SENT>
