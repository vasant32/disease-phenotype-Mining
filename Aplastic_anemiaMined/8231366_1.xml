<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To discover possible clinical and haematological factors which may be associated with predominant expansion of the number or size of adipocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To analyze the prognostic value of the adipocyte number and size </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The adipose tissue of 25 plastic-embedded bone marrow specimens corresponding to patients with aplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> was studied stereologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The correlation study between the results obtained and clinical and haematological data was carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The expansion of the adipose tissue is due to the predominant increase of the adipocyte number in some cases and of the adipocyte size in others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among different clinical and haematological factors, only a lower age is significantly associated with a predominant increase of adipocyte number </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the prognostic stratification performed according to three different systems, neither the adipocyte number nor the size showed a statistically significant association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In the aplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo>, the younger patients expand their bone marrow adipose tissue by increasing predominantly the adipocyte number, whereas in the older patients this occurs by predominantly increasing the adipocyte size (may be due to the decrease in proliferative potential) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, both the adipocyte number and size lack prognostic significance </plain></SENT>
