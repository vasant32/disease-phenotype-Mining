<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The aim of our study was to describe the incidence, clinical course, and risk factors for the idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> syndrome (IPS), compared with those previously described for "idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo>," after bone marrow transplantation (BMT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Our study design was a case-series review with determination of risk by comparison with unaffected controls by log-rank or Fisher's exact (two-tailed) test and logistic regression analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study group comprised 1165 consecutive marrow recipients at a single center from 1988 to 1991 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: IPS was documented in 85 BMT recipients (7.3%) by bronchoalveolar lavage (n=68), open lung biopsy (n=3), or autopsy (n=14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The calculated actuarial incidence for IPS within 120 days after BMT was 7.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median time to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> was 21 days (mean 34+/-30) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hospital mortality was 74%, and 53 BMT recipients (62%) died with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004893'>progressive respiratory failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>IPS resolved in 22 patients (26%); 18 patients (21%) survived to discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mechanical ventilation was required by 59 BMT recipients (69%), within a median of 2 days of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of infiltrates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two of these 59 recipients (3%) survived to discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0006532'>Pulmonary infection</z:hpo> (predominantly fungal) was noted in 7 of 25 (28%) BMT recipients who had an autopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Potential risk factors for IPS were assessed in univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Although the incidence was not significantly different between autologous (5.7%) and allogeneic marrow recipients (7.6%), risks were identified only for the latter: <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> other than <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (odds ratio=6.5 compared with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>), and grade 4 graft-versus-host disease (odds ratio=5.4 compared with lower grades) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No factors were associated with recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of idiopathic lung injury seems lower, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> earlier, and the risk factors different from those previously reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The major risks seem to be regimen-related toxicity and multi-organ dysfunction associated with alloreactive processes </plain></SENT>
