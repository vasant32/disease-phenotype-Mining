<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi> copper chlorophyllin (<z:mp ids='MP_0004207'>SCC</z:mp>) on the proliferation, differentiation and immunomodulatory function of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from mice with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A mouse model of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> was established by exposure of BALB/c mice to sublethal doses of 5.0 Gy Co60 γ radiation, followed by transplantation of 2×10(6) lymph node cells from <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi>/2 donor mice within 4 h after radiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Aplastic anemic BALB/c mice were randomly divided into six groups: the treated groups, which received 25, 50, or 100 mg/kg/day <z:mp ids='MP_0004207'>SCC</z:mp>, respectively; a positive control group treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> A (CsA); and an untreated model control group (model group); while, the non-irradiated mice as the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0004207'>SCC</z:mp> or CsA were administered by gastrogavage for 20 days, starting on day 4 after irradiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Peripheral blood cells were counted and colony-forming fibroblasts (CFU-F) in the bone marrow were assayed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The ability of MSCs to form calcium nodes after culture in osteoinductive medium was also observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The immunosuppressive effect of MSCs on T lymphocytes was analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and flow cytometry, to evaluate the efficacy of <z:mp ids='MP_0004207'>SCC</z:mp> in mice with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Peripheral blood white cell and platelet counts were increased by medium and high <z:mp ids='MP_0004207'>SCC</z:mp> doses, compared with the untreated control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CFU-Fs were also increased compared with the untreated control, and the numbers of calcium nodes in MSCs in osteoinductive medium were elevated in response to <z:mp ids='MP_0004207'>SCC</z:mp> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The percentage of Forkhead box protein 3 (FOXP3(+)) T cells was increased in T cell-MSC cocultures, and the cytokine transforming growth factor β1 was up-regulated in <z:mp ids='MP_0004207'>SCC</z:mp>-treated groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that <z:mp ids='MP_0004207'>SCC</z:mp> not only promotes the proliferation and differentiation of MSCs, but also improves their immunoregulatory capacity in mice with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
