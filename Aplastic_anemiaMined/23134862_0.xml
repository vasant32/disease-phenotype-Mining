<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The BALB/c female mice SAA model was constructed by intraperitoneal injection with IFN-γ and intragastric administration with BU (combined group), with BU group, IFN-γ group and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> group as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After collecting the mononuclear cells in the peripheral blood (PB) and spleen of mice in each group, the percentage of CD4(+)CD25(+)FOXP3(+) Treg cells and Th17 cells in the mononuclear cells were detected by flow cytometry(FCM), and to analyze the changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The percentage of the Treg cells in PB and spleen was (3.19 ± 0.76)% and (4.77 ± 1.05)% respectively in combined group, being significantly lower than in other three groups (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The percentage of the Th17 cells in PB and spleen was (2.07 ± 0.12)% and (3.18 ± 0.46)% respectively in combined group, being significantly higher than that in other three groups (P &lt; 0.05 and 0.01, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Lower Treg cells and higher Th17 cells was found in the novel mouse SAA model induced by IFN-γ combined with BU, which demonstrates that this SAA model may be more close to the human immune-mediated marrow failure </plain></SENT>
