<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> induced by <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> exposure are less frequent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE PRESENTATION: We present an unusual case of triple synchronous primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> most likely induced by occupational <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> exposure in a male patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This spray painter was diagnosed as <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> in his 21 years old after exposing to high concentration of <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> for three years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Then he was treated with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoid</z:chebi> for four years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>40 years later, this patient developed three synchronous primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> with three different histologies including a basaloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> of the esophagus, primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001402'>hepatocellular carcinoma</z:hpo>, and well-differentiated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous cell carcinoma</z:hpo> of the gum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This case reminds us that the occurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> should be monitored in workers with occupational history linked with a high concentration exposure to <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi>, though it's rarely happened </plain></SENT>
