<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We administered leukocyte transfusions (LT) to 10 children suffering from documented life-threatening <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> during profound, prolonged <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nine had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo>, and one had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>; three were bone marrow transplant recipients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These 10 were the only patients in our unit who received LT during the past 7 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median leukocyte dose was 0.6 x 10(9)/kg in total </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Instead of leukapheresis products, we used pooled buffy coats from random donors, with a high relative content of lymphocytes and especially T lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The leukocyte concentrates were irradiated with 15 Gy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 10 patients, we observed prompt and sustained myeloid marrow recovery following LT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Such an effect of LT has never been described before </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We hypothesize that in the internal milieu of these aplastic patients the transfused leukocytes were stimulated to secrete cytokines, the result being a cascade-like phenomenon and stimulation and proliferation of the patient's own bone marrow cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The bone marrow-stimulating effect of LT merits further study </plain></SENT>
