<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To analyze the efficacy and side-effects of combination of rabbit antithymocyte globulin (ATG) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> A (CsA) as the first-line immunosuppressive therapy (IST) for adult severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (SAA) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Adult SAA or very severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (VSAA) patients treated with rabbit ATG + CsA as first line therapy in our hospital from 2003 to 2008 were retrospectively analysed and the therapeutic response relevant factors were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventy-nine patients were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these patients, 6 died within 3 months after IST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The overall response rate was 82.2% and the median time to transfusion independent was 60 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The therapeutic response rate in 32 SAA patients (100%) was significantly higher than that in 41 VSAA cases (68.3%) (P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with neutrophil response to G-CSF treatment had a higher IST response rate than those without response to G-CSF (100% vs 67.5%, P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sixty-one patients (77.2%) occurred <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036830" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">serum sickness</z:e> reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three patients relapsed and two developed clonal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001871'>hematological abnormalities</z:hpo> after IST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The 3-year overall survival for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients was 88.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Rabbit ATG in combination with CsA as first-line IST for adult SAA can lead to excellent treatment outcomes with minor adverse effects </plain></SENT>
