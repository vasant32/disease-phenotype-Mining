<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Domestic cats infected with the horizontally transmitted feline <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> virus subgroup A (FeLV-A) often produce mutants (termed FeLV-C) that bind to a distinct cell surface receptor and cause severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> in vivo and erythroblast destruction in bone marrow cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The major determinant for FeLV-C-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> has been mapped to a small region of the surface envelope <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> that is responsible for its receptor binding specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, erythroblast destruction may directly or indirectly result from FeLV-C binding to its receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To address these issues, we functionally cloned a putative cell surface receptor for FeLV-C (FLVCR) by using a human T-lymphocyte cDNA library in a retroviral vector </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Expression of the 2.0-kbp FLVCR cDNA in naturally resistant Swiss mouse fibroblasts and Chinese hamster ovary cells caused substantial susceptibility to FeLV-C but no change in susceptibilities to FeLV-B and other retroviruses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The predicted FLVCR protein contains 555 amino acids and 12 hydrophobic potential membrane-spanning sequences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Database searches indicated that FLVCR is a member of the major-facilitator superfamily of transporters and implied that it may transport an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="25696">organic anion</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> blot analyses showed that FLVCR <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> is expressed in multiple hematopoietic lineages rather than specifically in erythroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the targeted destruction of erythroblasts by FeLV-C may derive from their greater sensitivity to this virus rather than from a preferential <z:hpo ids='HP_0002719'>susceptibility to infection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
