<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The lack of a simple, rapid, and quantitative test of the functional activity of the monocyte has hampered studies of the contribution of this cell type to host defense and human disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This report describes an assay of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, which depends exclusively upon the monocyte as the effector cell and therefore provides a convenient test of monocyte function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this system, mononuclear leukocytes (MNL) obtained by Ficoll-Hypaque separation of whole blood are cytotoxic for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50076">51Cr</z:chebi>-labeled human erythrocyte targets coated with anti-blood group antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Removal of phagocytic monocytes from the MNL by iron ingestion, followed by exposure to a magnetic field, completely abolishes <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cytotoxic activity from the remaining MNL population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Similarly, in severely mono-cytopenic patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, cytotoxic effector activity is absent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normals</z:mpath> and less severely monocytopenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> patients, cytotoxicity correlates significantly (p less than 0.001) with monocyte number </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Application of this monocyte-mediated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity assay to the study of patients with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043194" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome</z:e> has revealed defective monocyte cytotoxic activity in spite of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> monocyte numbers, suggesting that this test may be useful for the assessment of monocyte function in a variety of clinical situations </plain></SENT>
