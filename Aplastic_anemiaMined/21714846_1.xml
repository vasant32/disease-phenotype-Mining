<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we present a case of a patient transplanted for idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> with a T-cell depleted hematopoietic stem cell graft from an HLA-C mismatched unrelated donor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At day 7 posttransplant, she suffered from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001919'>acute renal failure</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000790'>hematuria</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The presence of numerous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001981'>schistocytes</z:hpo>, an increased level of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase and a renal biopsy with multiple vascular injuries confirmed the diagnosis of severe TA-<z:chebi fb="39" ids="18139,53050">TMA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At day 14, she developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft versus host disease</z:e> and died 7 months posttransplantation of multiorgan failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At day 15, we observed a sizable population of natural killer (NK) cells in the peripheral blood, the number of which reached 0.8 G/L at 4 months posttransplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most NK cells lacked inhibitory killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR) specific for the KIR-ligands expressed in the patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>NK cells were also abundantly present in pericardial and pleural fluids and had invaded the kidney, where they colocalized with the renal vasculopathy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Because there are several mechanisms through which NK cells and platelets can activate each other reciprocally, it is conceivable that NK cells contribute to TA-<z:chebi fb="39" ids="18139,53050">TMA</z:chebi> and its progression </plain></SENT>
