<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated the in vivo effects of a crude extract from the urine of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> patients (AA urinary extract) on erythroid precursor cells in the femoral bone marrow and spleens of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> adult mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A single intraperitoneal injection of AA urinary extract induced a significant increase in the number of splenic erythroid burst-forming units (BFU-e) and erythroid colony-forming units (CFU-e) within 24 h after injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We then injected pure recombinant erythropoietin (Epo) equivalent to the amount present in the urinary extract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This addition increased the number of splenic CFU-e by almost the same degree as the amount induced by the AA urinary extract 24 h after injection, but failed to elicit any change in the number of splenic BFU-e </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In other studies, mice were injected with the same amount of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi> (LPS) and/or pure Epo as that present in the AA urinary extract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Experiments with Limulus amebocyte lysate-adsorbed (endotoxin-depleted) or nonadsorbed (endotoxin-containing) AA urinary extracts showed that endotoxin contamination interfered with the increase in numbers of marrow CFU-e and enhanced the increase in splenic CFU-e numbers induced by pure Epo or Epo activity in the AA urinary extract </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The number of splenic BFU-e, however, was not affected by administration of LPS and/or Epo or by adsorbed endotoxin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that AA urinary extract contains a stimulating activity for mouse splenic BFU-e, and that this activity is not attributable to the Epo activity or endotoxin contamination within the urinary extract </plain></SENT>
