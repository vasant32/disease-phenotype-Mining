<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This was in contrast to brain tissue of cats infected with FeLV-C alone, which showed no such staining </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The data suggested that at least one or more of the presumptive recombinant viruses could specifically infect <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>-derived endothelial cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequencing strategies to amplify and analyze DNA fragments of the proviral SU region from cells infected with REC-selected viruses, we found the occurrence of a single recombinant in which two-thirds of the SU gene from the N-terminus of FeLV-C was replaced by the endogenous FeLV element </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This recombinant virus, when molecularly cloned, should be useful in determining its potential in vivo neuropathogenicity </plain></SENT>
