<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The standardization was achieved by logarithmic regression of the EP titier on Hb either by the two-phase linear form or by the third degree sigmoid form at a 95% confidence limit for each regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The third degree regression was found to be preferable from the view point of both statistics and the negative feedback mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The average and scattering of the deviation from the standard level thus determined of the disease groups indicated that the EP level is: (1) 12 fold higher than the standard level in 42 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemias</z:hpo> (the most in excess and a few in standard) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>(2) three fold higher than that in 27 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (relatively higher dispersed state) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>(3) 29% of the standard level in 33 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemias</z:hpo> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>chronic renal failure</z:hpo> (deficient state) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>(4) 105% of the extrapolated standard level in 22 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001901'>polycythemia</z:hpo> veras (standard state) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The standardization of Hb-related Ep titer may provide new pathophysiological approaches in a variety of hematopoietic disorders </plain></SENT>
