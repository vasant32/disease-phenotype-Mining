<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In alloHCT, different immune cell types mediate beneficial graft-versus-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> (GvT) effects, regulate detrimental <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GvHD), and are required for protection against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Today, the "good" (GvT effector cells and memory cells conferring protection) cannot be easily separated from the "bad" (GvHD-causing cells), and alloHCT remains a hazardous medical modality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells into an immunosuppressed patient creates a delicate environment for the reconstitution of donor blood and immune cells in co-existence with host cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunological reconstitution determines to a large extent the immune status of the allo-transplanted host against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> and the recurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, and is critical for long-term protection and survival after clinical alloHCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Animal models continue to be extremely valuable experimental tools that widen our understanding of, for example, the dynamics of post-transplant hematopoiesis and the complexity of immune reconstitution with multiple ways of interaction between host and donor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this review, we discuss the rat as an experimental model of HCT between allogeneic individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We summarize our findings on lymphocyte reconstitution in transplanted rats and illustrate the disease pathology of this particular model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We also introduce the rat skin explant assay, a feasible alternative to in vivo transplantation studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The skin explant assay can be used to elucidate the biology of graft-versus-host reactions, which are known to have a major impact on immune reconstitution, and to perform genome-wide gene expression studies using controlled combinations of minor and major histocompatibility between the donor and the recipient </plain></SENT>
