<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Another fraction at lower pH contained both activities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This is the first report of the existence of a fraction with BPA but without Ep activity in sera from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In trying to measure BPA in sera and urine, a new assay procedure was used involving counting the number of erythroid bursts in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human marrow cell cultures initiated with test samples to which 1-2 units of standard Ep were added 5-6 days later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Separation of BPA from Ep activity in patients sera was also attempted by Sephadex G-100 but this was unsuccessful due to the presence of inhibitors to burst formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Also, in a urine separation, BPA and Ep activities were eluted in the same fraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sephadex G-100 chromatography gave results which seemed to indicate separation of BPA from Ep activity, however, this may have been due to the presence of inhibitor(s) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This idea was supported by the fact that the peaks of both activities coincided when a urine preparation containing no inhibitors was tested </plain></SENT>
