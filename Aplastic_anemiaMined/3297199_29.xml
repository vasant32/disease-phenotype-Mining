<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They were given a second marrow transplant from either the same (n = 13) or a second (n = 3) HLA-identical sibling between 23 and 743 (median 86) days after the first transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The preparation for the second transplant included <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, 50 mg/kg, on each of four successive days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twelve hours after each of the first three doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, antithymocyte globulin, 30 mg/kg/dose, was infused </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One of the 16 patients died from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> too early after the second transplant to be evaluated, two had failure of engraftment and died with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, one rejected the second graft and is surviving almost 5 years later with full autologous marrow recovery, and 12 had successful and sustained second grafts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of these 12, six are surviving between 11 months and 7 3/4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four of the six have no graft-v-host disease (GVHD), while two have <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD requiring treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Five have Karnofsky scores of 100% and one of 90% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Six of the 12 patients with sustained grafts died between 63 days and 38 months after transplantation, four with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> (related in two patients to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD), one with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD, and one with <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The average interval from first to second transplant was 308 days during the past five years, compared to 61 days in earlier patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Five of seven recent patients are surviving, compared to two of nine earlier patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, successful second transplants after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> and antithymocyte globulin are possible in most patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> who have rejected their first marrow grafts; however, mortality remains high, with only 40% of the patients becoming long-term survivors </plain></SENT>
