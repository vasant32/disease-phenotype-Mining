<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report here the case of a nine-yr-old girl suffering from a severe refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> who received an unrelated, 9/10 HLA-matched <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSC</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Soon after transplantation, the patient developed a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GvHD), a TA-<z:chebi fb="39" ids="18139,53050">TMA</z:chebi>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal insufficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These pathologies remained refractory to the various treatments undertaken and required several hospitalizations in the intensive care unit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On day 106 post-<z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSC</z:chebi> transfusion, after several episodes of intensive care, the patient was infused with mismatched, third-party MSCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Schizocyte levels rapidly decreased after MSC infusion, and two wk later, most biological parameters returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Erythrocyte and thrombocyte transfusions were discontinued, and the patient remained stable for 10 wk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thereafter, TA-<z:chebi fb="39" ids="18139,53050">TMA</z:chebi> symptoms, <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> reactivation, pleural and cardiac effusions reappeared and lead to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of the patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our observations suggest that allogenic MSC infusion may decrease the symptoms of TA-<z:chebi fb="39" ids="18139,53050">TMA</z:chebi>, but further investigation is required to determine how and when MSC should be infused to develop a long-lasting protective effect </plain></SENT>
