<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To explore the relationship between CD8+ T-cell CD28 molecular expression in peripheral blood and TCM type in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (CAA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Using flow cytometry to detect the CD28 expression in 45 in-patients or out-patients and 24 healthy subjects for control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>And the relation with TCM type was analyzed from the immunological aspect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: (1) The levels of CD8, CD28, CD8+ CD28+ expression and CD8+ CD28+/CD8+ CD28- were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> higher in the CAA patients than those in the healthy subjects (P &lt; 0.05 or P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>(2) The levels of CD28, CD8+ CD28+ expression and CD8+ CD28+/CD8+ CD28- were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> higher in the CAA patients of Shen-Yin deficiency type than those in the CAA patients of Shen-Yang deficiency type (P &lt; 0.05 or P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: (1) The abnormal high expression of peripheral blood co-stimulatory molecules CD28 suggested CD28 disorder may play an important role in immuno-pathogenesis of CAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>(2) The levels of peripheral CD28, CD8+ CD28+ expression and CD8+ CD28+/CD8+ CD28- can be taken as an objective indexes for TCM typing of CAA, which was disordered more severe in patients of Shen-Yin deficiency type than in those of Shen-Yang deficiency type </plain></SENT>
