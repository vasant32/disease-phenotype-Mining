<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>Aplastic anemia</z:hpo> is a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematological disease</z:e> characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow hypoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Acquired cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> are almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> idiopathic and arise from unknown causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Other cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> are secondary and are caused by radiation, chemicals or viruses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATHOPHYSIOLOGY: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>Aplastic anemia</z:hpo> is manifested as a marked reduction in the number of pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells, but why this occurs is still uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Some of the proposed causes include abnormalities of the hematopoietic stem cells, abnormalities in the hematopoietic microenvironment, and immunologically mediated damage to the hematopoietic stem cells (Figure 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ABNORMALTIES OF THE HEMATOPOIETIC STEM CELLS: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, and long-term survivors in particular, are at increased risk of developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0004818'>paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelocytic leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This suggests that, in at least some of these patients, the hematopoietic stem cells themselves are abnormal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It also suggests that in some of these patients the blood cells are clonal (that is, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the blood cells are derived from a single pluripotent stem cell) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In short, what these findings imply is that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> may be caused by the emergence of an abnormal clone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Clonal hematopoiesis, however, can also be considered nothing more than a consequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In other words, it is possible that hematopoiesis in this kind of patient is performed by a lone pluripotent stem cell that somehow managed to survive eradication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No definitive interpretation of clonal hematopoiesis has been agreed upon, and it is still a topic for future research </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>ABNORMAL HEMATOPOIETIC MICROENVIRONMENT: The presence of stromal cells, which form the microenvironment of bone marrow, is very important in hematopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Hematopoietic stem cells proliferate and differentiate either by adhering to stromal cells or by being stimulated by the various hematopoietic factors that stromal cells produce </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it is quite possible that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> is caused by abnormalities in the hematopoietic microenvironment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>However, many separate studies have demonstrated that the hematopoietic microenvironment in the vast majority of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> cases is <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>IMMUNE MECHANISMS: <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">Immunosuppressive agents</z:chebi> are often effective in treating <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, and therefore it is believed that immunological mechanisms contribute to the disease in more than half the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The following mechanisms have been proposed as causes for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of immunologically mediated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>: * Decreases in Hematopoietic Factors Produced by Monocytes and Lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Some patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> show decreased production of interleukin 1 (IL-1) by peripheral blood monocytes, and it is possible that a drop in the concentration of this factor is linked to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the disease [1] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>It is also possible, however, that decreased IL-1 production by monocytes is not a cause of the disease, but merely a consequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Moreover, no cases have been reported that exhibit reduced production of hematopoietic factors produced by lymphocytes such as GM-CSF, IL-3, or IL-6. * Damage by Cytokines that Suppress Hematopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>It has been reported that increased levels of interferon &amp;ggr; (IFN-&amp;ggr;), which is produced by lymphocytes, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor &amp;agr; (TNF-&amp;agr;), which is produced by monocytes and macrophages, are found in the bone marrow and peripheral blood of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> patients [2, 3] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>These two factors act as suppressors of hematopoiesis, and it is possible that they contribute to the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>The increase of these inflammatory cytokines in the bone marrow strongly suggests the presence of either specific or non-specific destruction of the hematopoietic stem cells by immunoregulatory cells. * Suppression of Hematopoiesis by Cytotoxic T Cells (Killer T Cells) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Cases have been reported in which cytotoxic T cell clones that damage the autologous hematopoietic precursor cells are present [4] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we can easily conceive of a mechanism in which these cytotoxic T cells specifically destroy the hematopoietic stem cells and cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>. * Suppression of Hematopoiesis by Natural Killer (NK) Cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>NK activity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> patients is depressed, and, generally speaking, it is highly unlikely that NK cells contribute to this condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>However, it has been reported that clonal NK cells are thought to cause the disease in patients exhibiting <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow hypoplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>Therefore, when this disease is diagnosed, a peripheral blood granular lymphocyte count and NK cell surface marker analysis should always be performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="30" pm="."><plain>DIAGNOSIS: A necessary condition for the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> is the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="31" pm="."><plain>Moreover, it is necessary to rule out <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="32" pm="."><plain>It is especially important in differential diagnosis to look for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="33" pm="."><plain>In cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> there are patients that exhibit <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> during the course of the disease, and this condition is called <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="34" pm="."><plain>It has recently been shown that bone marrow and peripheral blood cells in some patients diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> are partially lacking GPI anchor proteins (CD16, CD55, and CD59) [5] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="35" pm="."><plain>Whether such patients become to exhibit <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> syndrome in the future remains to be elucidated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="36" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> the bone marrow generally exhibits normoplasia or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath>, and only in rare cases does it exhibit <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="37" pm="."><plain>This condition is referred to as hypoplastic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="38" pm="."><plain>Hypoplastic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> can be differentiated from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> by the presence of <z:mp ids='MP_0000358'>abnormal cell morphology</z:mp> that is sometimes accompanied by chromosomal abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="39" pm="."><plain>TREATMENT:<z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>Aplastic anemia</z:hpo> is treated with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="50113">androgens</z:chebi>, high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> (CyA), antithymocyte globulin (ATG), antilymphocyte globulin (ALG), hematopoietic growth factors such as G-CSF, and bone marrow transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="40" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, patients who require continuous CyA administration to maintain stable hematopoiesis have a specific HLA class II haplotype (DRB1*1501-DQA1*0102-DQB1*0602) [6] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="41" pm="."><plain>Recent reports from EBMT SAA Working Party showed the excellent therapeutic result (response rate 82%) when severe cases were treated with ALG, CyA and G-CSF in combination [7] </plain></SENT>
