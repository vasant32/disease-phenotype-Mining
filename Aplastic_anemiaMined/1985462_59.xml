<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>He later developed hepatic, renal, and exocrine pancreatic dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At the age of 5 years he developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000505'>visual impairment</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001337'>tremor</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001251'>ataxia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003701'>proximal muscle weakness</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000544'>external ophthalmoplegia</z:hpo>, and a <z:hpo ids='HP_0000580'>pigmentary retinopathy</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="KSS">Kearns-Sayre syndrome</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Muscle biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003737'>mitochondrial myopathy</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analysis of mtDNA from leukocytes and muscle showed mtDNA heteroplasmy in both tissues, with one population of mtDNA deleted by 4.9 kb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The deleted region was bridged by a 13-nucleotide sequence occurring as a direct repeat in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mtDNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both Pearson syndrome and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="KSS">Kearns-Sayre syndrome</z:e> have been noted to be associated with deletions of mtDNA; they have not previously been described in the same patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These observations indicate that the two disorders have the same molecular basis; the different phenotypes are probably determined by the initial proportion of deleted mtDNAs and modified by selection against them in different tissues </plain></SENT>
