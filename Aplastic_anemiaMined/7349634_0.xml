<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Urinary proteins from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001891'>iron deficiency anemia</z:hpo> and acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> were fractionated by chromatography on QAE-Sephadex A-50 and Sephadex G-25 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fractions containing erythroid burst promoting activity (code named regulatory protein RP) were separated from erythropoietin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mouse bone marrow cells were preincubated for one day in suspension culture, in the presence or absence of RP, transferred to a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53448">methylcellulose</z:chebi> based system and incubated for six more days with erythropoietin (EPO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It was found that the presence of RP in the preincubation medium had a 2 to 4 fold enhancing effect on subsequent erythroid burst colony formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, when RP was added to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53448">methylcellulose</z:chebi> based cultures simultaneously with EPO, the erythroid burst response was reduced or abolished </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Addition of RP to marrow cell suspension cultures increased the number of self replicating, pluripotent (erythroid/granuloid, E/G ratio = 3) spleen colony forming units (CFU-S) found at the end of 2 days incubation 3-5 fold over their number in control cultures incubated without the factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In marked contrast to this, addition of EPO to the cultures caused an increased persistence of CFU-S with a predominantly erythroid commitment (E/G ratio = 19) and a low self replicating ability, as measured by retransplantation of spleen cells into secondary recipients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These observations are compatible with the presence in RP of a factor, or factors, capable of maintaining the size of certain early precursor cell compartments </plain></SENT>
