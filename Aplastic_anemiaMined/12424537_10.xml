<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Overproduction of TNF-alpha by bone marrow and peripheral blood-derived cells was shown to be of pathogenetic importance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Genetic factors have been suggested by higher specific histocompatibility antigen frequencies among AA patients as a group and among those unresponsive to immunosuppressive therapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present work we expand on the evidence for the contribution of the TNF system to therapeutic responses in patients with AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The response to immunosuppressive therapy at 3 months was found to be significantly more frequent among carriers of the TNF2 (TNF -308 A) gene (TNF2 homozygotes and heterozygotes of the TNF-alpha promoter/enhancer polymorphism) than among those patients not carrying the TNF2 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The allelic distribution of the LT-alpha (TNF-beta) NcoI and IL-1 receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) polymorphisms did not differ among the subgroups of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The association of the TNF-alpha genotype with a response to immunosuppressive therapy points to an immunogenetic association that may contribute to the pathogenesis and therapeutic response of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
