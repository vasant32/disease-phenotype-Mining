<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Mutations in the gene coding for the <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> component of telomerase, hTERC, have been found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0009563'>dyskeratosis</z:mp> congenita (DC) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0004818'>Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>) is a clonal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">blood disorder</z:e> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and characterized by the presence of one or more clones of blood cells lacking <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24410">glycosylphosphatidylinositol</z:chebi> (GPI) anchored proteins due to a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutation</z:hpo> in the PIGA gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We searched for mutations in DNA extracted from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> patients by amplification of the hTERC gene and denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (dHPLC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After a mutation was found in a potential transcription factor binding site in one patient electrophoretic mobility shift assays were used to detect binding of transcription factors to that site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The effect of the mutation on the function of the promoter was tested by transient transfection constructs in which the promoter is used to drive a reporter gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Here we report the finding of a novel promoter mutation (-99C-&gt;G) in the hTERC gene in a patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mutation disrupts an Sp1 binding site and destroys its ability to bind Sp1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Transient transfection assays show that mutations in this hTERC site including C-99G cause either up- or down-regulation of promoter activity and suggest that the site regulates core promoter activity in a context dependent manner in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: These data are the first report of an hTERC promoter mutation from a patient sample which can modulate core promoter activity in vitro, raising the possibility that the mutation may affect the transcription of the gene in hematopoietic stem cells in vivo, and that dysregulation of telomerase may play a role in the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> and the evolution of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> clones </plain></SENT>
