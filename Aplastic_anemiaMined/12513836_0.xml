<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Results showed that the production of CFU-GM on the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> SL was significantly higher than that of the control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The production of CFU-GM on the SL of 4 AA patients, who responded to anisodamine, was &lt; 80% of the control, and when 2 of them were reexamined for stromal function after treatment, the number of CFU-GM on SL rose up to 168.8% and 249.2% from 38.7% and 39.7% of the control respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>While in the rest 6 patients, the number of CFU-GM was &gt; 80% of the control, only one patient was improved by anisodamine therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>So, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow stromal layer can obviously support the growth of granulocyte/macrophage progenitor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Anisodamine therapy could be an effective agents for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> with stromal dysfunction </plain></SENT>
