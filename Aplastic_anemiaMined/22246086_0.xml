<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report a single-center experience in treating 18 consecutive patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (SAA) who received unrelated cord blood transplantation (CBT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The median age was 17 years (range 5-61 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sixteen cases received a reduced-intensity regimen composed of CY (total dose 1200 mg/m(2)), rabbit antithymocyte globulin (ATG, total dose 30 mg/kg) and fludarabine (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FLU</z:e>, total dose 120 mg/m(2)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CYA and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="168396">mycophenolate</z:chebi> mofetil were used as GVHD prophylaxis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two patients were not evaluable for engraftment because of early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> on day +21 and +22 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only one of the sixteen cases achieved engraftment, but experienced secondary graft failure 3 months post transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients experienced primary graft rejection, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of them acquired autologous recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 3-month and 6-month cumulative incidence of response was 56% and 81%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>So far, 16 patients have survived for 330-1913 days (median, 750 days) after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The probability of OS at 2 years was 88.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our data indicate that CBT for newly diagnosed SAA using no irradiation but <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FLU</z:e> and ATG-based conditioning still seems to inevitably lead to the high risk of rejection, but may facilitate autologous recovery and improve survival with low risk of transplant-related mortality </plain></SENT>
