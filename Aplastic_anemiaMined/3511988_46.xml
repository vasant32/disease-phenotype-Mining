<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Ninety-six patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> who received a sex-mismatched, HLA-identical allogeneic sibling marrow transplant had sequential cytogenetic analyses performed to determine the incidence and implications of posttransplant mixed hematologic chimerism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of the 96 patients, 56 (58.3%) became mixed chimeras with coexisting host and donor cells detected in peripheral blood or marrow 14 days or later after transplant, and 40 patients (41.7%) were complete chimeras with 100% donor-type hematopoietic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The incidence of mixed chimerism was independent of prior blood production transfusions and infusion of donor buffy coat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The rejection rate was significantly increased in the mixed chimeric group, particularly in patients not receiving buffy coat (14 of 36 rejecting), although overall, the majority (69.7%) retained their first graft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Rejection was seen almost exclusively in patients exposed to multiple transfusions before transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>If patients who reject their first graft are censored, the overall incidence of grades II through IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> graft-v-host disease (GVHD) was significantly reduced in those with mixed chimerism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Transfused patients with mixed chimerism in particular were less likely to develop grades II through IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD was similar in the two groups and did not significantly influence survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In this study, mixed chimerism persisted for up to 395 days posttransplant, either the first graft being rejected or, more commonly, hematopoiesis reverting to 100% donor-type cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mixed lymphohematopoietic chimerism may persist in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> who have received matched allogeneic marrow transplants for significant periods before hematopoiesis reverts to donor cell type </plain></SENT>
