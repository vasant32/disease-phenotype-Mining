<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To clarify the control mechanism of production of erythropoietic growth factors in anemic states, we compared erythropoietin (Epo) and burst-promoting activity (BPA) in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001891'>iron deficiency anemia</z:hpo>, using in vitro erythroid progenitor assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although serum levels of Epo activity increased in the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, the rise was more marked in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>BPA was high only in the sera of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum levels of BPA of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> negatively correlated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> concentrations, while those of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001891'>iron deficiency anemia</z:hpo> did not correlate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 2 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> who responded well to <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi> therapy, serum levels of Epo activity and BPA decreased after the hemopoiesis had recovered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that serum levels of BPA do not rise in response to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The elevated BPA levels in sera in cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> are probably related to a reduction in the number of hemopoietic stem cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we observed that BPA in bone-marrow-conditioned medium (BMCM) from patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> increased more than in the BMCM from patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001891'>iron deficiency anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, our findings suggest that the enhanced BPA production depends on a decrease in hemopoietic precursors rather than the anemic state </plain></SENT>
