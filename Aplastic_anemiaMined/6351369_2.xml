<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> people showed 3 +/- 2% of peripheral blood T cells to be Ia+ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During the first 130 days posttransplant, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patient groups showed a moderate elevation in the percentage (mean: 21-26%) of Ia+ T cells, regardless of the type of transplant performed, and regardless of the presence or absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although there was marked individual variation (range 5-76%), there was a trend towards a decrease in the percentage of Ia+ T cells with increasing time after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Long-term survivors still showed a small (range 3-20%, mean 10%) but significant elevation in the relative number of Ia+ T cells 1-3.4 years after transplantation, regardless of the presence or absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is not currently known why Ia+ T cells are found in these patients, but accelerated lymphopoiesis, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0275522" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">subclinical infection</z:e>, and excessive immune stimulation caused by microorganisms or other foreign antigens could be contributing factors </plain></SENT>
