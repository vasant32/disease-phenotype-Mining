<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Published reports for treatment of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> were searched with Medline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Search terms included severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, HLA-matched sibling, unrelated donor, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Survival after HLA-matched sibling donor transplantation is approximately 80% in patients aged less than 20 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Survival rates are lower in older patients ranging from 50-70% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The risks of transplant-related morbidity and mortality increase with age and explain the observed lower survival rates in older patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Unrelated donor transplantation is reserved for patients who lack a matched related donor and have failed at least one course of immunosuppressive therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Survival after unrelated donor transplantation has also improved in recent years and largely attributed to the selection of donors who are fully HLA-matched to the patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The risks of transplant-related complications are higher than after HLA-matched sibling transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">Graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) is higher; GVHD can lead to significant morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Other frequent complications include graft failure and pulmonary complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The use of peripheral blood progenitor cells has also contributed to higher GVHD risks and consequently excess <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: The results of allogeneic transplantation, from related and unrelated donors have improved substantially in the last decade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Early referral for transplantation, selection of HLA-matched donors and improved supportive care has contributed to the success of this treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The choice of graft used for transplantation is important regardless of donor type; bone marrow is the preferred graft </plain></SENT>
