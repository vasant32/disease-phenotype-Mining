<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: <z:hpo ids='HP_0004818'>Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>) is a clonal disorder due to a PIG-A gene mutation, resulting in deficient expression of GPI-anchored-proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both immune-mediated suppression of hematopoiesis and cytokine alterations have been reported in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, a disease closely related to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> whereas no data are available on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> itself </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of exogenous cytokines on clonogenic activity in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: We evaluated burst-forming units-erythroid (BFU-E) and colony-forming units-granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM) in bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMC) from 5 PNH patients and 5 controls, alone or in the presence of transforming-growth-factor (TGF)-beta, interferon (IFN)-gamma, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor (TNF)-alpha, and specific antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Molecular analysis of the PIG-A gene was performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and direct sequencing on every single colony </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients' cells showed less clonogenic activity than did control cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>, addition of TGF-beta inhibited both BFU-E and CFU-GM; IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha inhibited BFU-E alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In patients cytokines modulated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and mutated clones differently: TGF-b reduced the number of PIG-A- and PIG-A+ colony-forming-cells (CFC), whereas TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma reduced PIG-A+ CFC only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>BMMC from patients showed higher TGF-beta production than did BMMC from controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: TGF-beta could contribute to the genesis of the unfavorable bone marrow microenvironment but does not seem to play a role in the in vivo dominance of PIG-A deficient cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mutated clones were more resistant to the inhibitory effects of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha, suggesting that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> cells may have a growth advantage in an unfavorable microenvironment </plain></SENT>
