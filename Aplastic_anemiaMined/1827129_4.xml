<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>8 of 18 individual clonal T cell populations stably coexpressed CD4 and CD8 molecules, a phenotype characteristic for thymocytes and a minor subpopulation of circulating T lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Analysis of T cell receptor genes revealed identical rearrangements of T cell receptor beta chain genes, suggesting clonality of these T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CD4+/CD8+ T cells clones were found to be efficiently cytotoxic towards autologous lymphoblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Autocytotoxicity could be blocked by a CD3 MAb, a MAb specific for monomorphic MHC class II determinants, and particularly, by an MHC-DP-specific MAb, suggesting specificity for autologous DP molecules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Perhaps more important, CD4+/CD8+ T cell clones inhibited differentiation of autologous progenitor enriched bone marrow cells in vitro by a direct cell-mediated mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that circulating cytotoxic CD4+/CD8+ T cell clones specific for autologous MHC-DP determinants may be involved in hematopoietic failure in some cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
