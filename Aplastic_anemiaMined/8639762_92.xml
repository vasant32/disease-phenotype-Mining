<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To better understand factors regulating TPO levels, we measured blood levels of TPO in patients with impaired platelet production due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) and with platelet destructive disorders, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001973'>idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi>), posttransfusion <z:hpo ids='HP_0000979'>purpura</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52242">PTP</z:chebi>), drug <z:hpo ids='HP_0000979'>purpura</z:hpo> (DP), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001417'>X-linked</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> (XLTP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The TPO receptor capture enzyme immunoassay (EIA) used had a detection limit of integral of approximately-150 to 200 pg/mL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>TPO was undetectable in 88 of 89 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eighteen of 19 patients with AA and a mean platelet count (MPC) of 18,000/microliters (2,000 to 61,000/microliters) had markedly elevated TPO levels (mean, 1,467 pg/mL; range, 597 to 3,834 pg/mL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eight AA patients who responded to immunosuppressive therapy with their MPC increasing to 140,000/microliters (92,000 to 175,000/microliters) had substantial decreases in TPO (mean, 440 pg/mL; range, 193 to 771 pg/mL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Initial TPO levels did not differ significantly between responders and nonresponders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 21 patients with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> and an MPC of 16,000/microliters (1,000 to 51,000 /microliters) had undetectable TPO levels, as did 6 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52242">PTP</z:chebi> or DP and 2 patients with XLTP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Megakaryocyte mass, reflected in the rate of platelet production, appears to be the major determinant of TPO levels in thrombocytopenic patients rather than circulating platelet levels per se </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Measurement of serum TPO may be useful in differentiating <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenias</z:hpo> due to peripheral destruction from those due to thrombopoietic failure </plain></SENT>
