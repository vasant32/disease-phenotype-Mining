<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PIG-A gene mutations in AA/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> and hemolytic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> are thought to be similar, but studies on AA/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> have been limited to individual cases and a few small series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have studied a large series of AA patients with a GPI anchor-deficient clone (AA/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>), including patients with minor clones, to determine whether their pattern of PIG-A mutations was identical to the reported spectrum in hemolytic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AA patients with GPI anchor-deficient clones were identified by flow cytometry and minor clones were enriched by immunomagnetic selection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A variety of methods was used to analyze PIG-A mutations, and 57 mutations were identified in 40 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The majority were similar to those commonly reported, but insertions in the range of 30 to 88 bp, due to tandem duplication of PIG-A sequences, and deletions of more than 10 bp were also seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 3 patients we identified identical 5-bp deletions by conventional methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This prompted the design of mutation-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers, which were used to demonstrate the presence of the same mutation in an additional 12 patients, identifying this as a mutational hot spot in the PIG-A gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multiple PIG-A mutations have been reported in 10% to 20% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that the large majority of AA/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> patients have multiple mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data may suggest a process of hypermutation in the PIG-A gene in AA stem cells </plain></SENT>
