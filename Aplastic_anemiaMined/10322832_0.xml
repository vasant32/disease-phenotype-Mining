<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Applying the techniques of cell culture and FACS to observe the bone marrow mononuclear, cells of 35 cases CAA before and after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: (1) BSSXC has the function of restoring the membrane receptors of IL-3, IL-6, IL-11 of hematopoietic stem cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>(2) The treatment effect of BSSXC is better than Western medicine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>(3) In treatment group, to stimulate the hematopolietic stem cell with IL-3, IL-6, IL-11, the rate of cell colony forming unit and CD34+ cell were obviously different between Yang Deficiency type and Yin Deficiency type before treatment (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After treatment the difference between these two types was also obvious (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: BSSXC could improve the membrane receptor of hematopoietic stem cell acted by hematopoietic stimulating factors </plain></SENT>
