<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>DC is a multisystem <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> syndrome exhibiting marked clinical and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>genetic heterogeneity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001417'>X-linked</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal recessive</z:hpo> subtypes are recognized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The gene mutated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001417'>X-linked</z:hpo> DC (DKC1) encodes a highly conserved nucleolar protein called dyskerin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Dyskerin associates with the H/ACA motif class of small nucleolar <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNAs</z:chebi> in small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein particles that are important in guiding the conversion of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17568">uracil</z:chebi> to pseudouracil during the maturation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18111">ribosomal RNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Dyskerin also associates with the TERC, which is important in the maintenance of telomeres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mutations in TERC have been identified in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> DC and in a subset of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Recently, heterozygous mutations in TERT have been found in some patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> DC and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additionally, patients with the severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0559758" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">multisystem disorder</z:e>, Hoyeraal-Hreidarsson syndrome, have been found to have DKC1 mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Collectively, these observations have demonstrated that classical DC, Hoyeraal-Hreidarsson syndrome and a subset of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> are due to a primary defect in telomerase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The critical role of telomeres and telomerase in humans is seen in the multisystem abnormalities found in these patients, including the increased incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>As <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> is the principal cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, conventional allografts have been attempted with limited success due to the high rate of pulmonary and endothelial complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, outcomes have improved with the use of non-myeloablative protocols, although the follow up is too short to evaluate long term toxicity and the natural course of the disease and it may be that correction of the telomerase defect is essential for the treatment of these patients </plain></SENT>
