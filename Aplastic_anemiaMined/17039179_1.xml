<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The peripheral destruction of formed blood elements, which frequently accompanies the syndrome, may obscure or delay the diagnosis of bone marrow suppression, and the number of published cases may be an underestimate of the actual incidence of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the disease course may differ significantly from other forms of acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and seems to carry a more favorable prognosis once effectively diagnosed and treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> may precede other manifestations of SLE </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the possibility of bone marrow <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> should be excluded in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> SLE patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo>, and conversely, the diagnosis of SLE should be explored in cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> in SLE, one with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> preceding the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of SLE, are described along with 15 cases reviewed from the English language literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The presentation, prognosis, treatment, and pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> complicating SLE are discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Recognition that cytopenias, especially <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo>, may occur on the basis of inhibited myelopoesis rather than peripheral destruction as either a harbinger of SLE or as a manifestation of disease flare is important </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This knowledge will prompt the astute clinician to obtain screening <z:hpo ids='HP_0003493'>antinuclear antibodies</z:hpo> in the setting of otherwise unexplained bone marrow acellularity or, given the prognosis of SLE associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, give early consideration to more aggressive immunosuppression </plain></SENT>
