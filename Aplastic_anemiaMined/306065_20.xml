<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mixtures of these cells were co-cultured in plasma clots in the presence of erythropoietin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Erythroid colonies grew in cultures of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> null cells if either <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or patient T cells were co-cultured with them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Null cells of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001908'>hypoplastic anemia</z:hpo> did not produce erythroid colonies under any culture conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We conclude that in this disorder, T cells function normally as helper cells in erythropoiesis and do not suppress colony formation, whereas the erythroid progenitor cells in the peripheral blood null-cell fractions are deficient in either number of function </plain></SENT>
