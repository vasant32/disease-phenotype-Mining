<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The ability to distinguish increased platelet (PLT) destruction from PLT hypoproduction is important in the care of patients with marrow failure syndromes and patients receiving high-dose chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The measurement of immature circulating PLTs based on <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> content using an automated counter is now feasible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study evaluated the impact of recent PLT transfusion on measurement of immature PLT variables </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The immature PLT fraction (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IPF</z:e>) and absolute immature PLT number (AIPN) were measured using a hematology analyzer before and after PLT transfusion in nine transfusion-dependent patients with marrow failure secondary to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo>, or transplantation conditioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IPF</z:e> and AIPN were also measured serially over 5 days of storage in three plateletpheresis components collected from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: PLT transfusion did not significantly change the mean AIPN in transfused patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IPF</z:e> decreased significantly from 6.6 ± 4.6% on Day -1 to 2.3 ± 1.4% on Day 0 before returning to 4.3 ± 2.3% on Day +1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the PLT component, AIPN and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IPF</z:e>% increased significantly over 5 days of storage, most likely due to an artifact of the staining and detection process for stored PLTs, no longer detected in vivo once the PLTs were transfused </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: PLT transfusion decreases the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IPF</z:e> due to the resultant increase in circulating PLT count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, PLT transfusion does not change the circulating AIPN, validating this assay as a reflection of ongoing PLT production by the marrow in various clinical settings, regardless of proximity to PLT transfusion </plain></SENT>
