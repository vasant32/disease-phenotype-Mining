<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Human telomerase has two core components, the <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> molecule (TERC) that provides the template for telomere repeat elongation and a reverse transcriptase (TERT) that is responsible for the addition of telomere repeats at the ends of each chromosome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutations in TERC have been found in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal-dominant</z:hpo> form of the inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> syndrome <z:mp ids='MP_0009563'>dyskeratosis</z:mp> congenita and in a subset of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These patients have short telomeres compared to age-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest that uncharacterised cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0009563'>dyskeratosis</z:mp> congenita/<z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> may have mutations in TERT or other molecules that associate with TERC in the telomerase complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have therefore screened the TERT gene for mutation by denaturing HPLC in 80 patients with inherited and acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> (24 with <z:mp ids='MP_0009563'>dyskeratosis</z:mp> congenita, 36 with constitutional <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, 13 with idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and 7 with other forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>15 different TERT mutations have been identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of these, 5 are in flanking intron sequences, 6 are synonymous and 4 are non-synonymous (missense) substitutions in the coding sequence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These are the first natural mutations of TERT to be described and we highlight their possible pathogenic role in the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
