<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The present multicenter study was undertaken to confirm whether filgrastim/recombinant human granulocyte colony stimulating factor (rhG-CSF) could mobilize residual multipotential stem cells by its G0-shortening effect in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) and induce a multilineage response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty-seven patients with acquired severe or moderate AA received long-term administration (2 to 12+ months) of rhG-CSF in doses from 100 to 400 micrograms/body/day by s.c. injection or 250 to 1,500 micrograms/body/day by i.v. infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six out of the 27 evaluable patients showed a substantial increase in neutrophils associated with a recovery of myeloid precursors in bone marrow within one month of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, 10 out of the 27 patients showed a dramatic improvement in severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> after two to ten months of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> improved after two to four months of therapy in three out of these ten patients accompanied by a significant increase in megakaryocytes in bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clonal cultures of bone marrow cells revealed a recovery in myeloid as well as erythroid precursors in most of these ten patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In two patients who showed a trilineage response, mixed and megakaryocyte colony formations also recovered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that long-term administration of rhG-CSF mobilizes myeloid, erythroid, megakaryocyte and multipotential progenitor cells and induces a multilineage response in some patients with AA </plain></SENT>
