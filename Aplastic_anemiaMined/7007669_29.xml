<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One hundred fourteen patients received one transplant and 30 received two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sustained engraftment of donor marrow occurred on the first transplant attempt in 76% of the patients whose engraftment status could be evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moderate, severe, or lethal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-vs-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) occurred in 52% of the engrafted patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The one-year survival rate for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients was 44% (64/144) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among the one-year survivors, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277554" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary disease</z:e> was apparently cured in 90% and improved in 10% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus far, four patients died one to five years after transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the 60 patients currently alive, ten have <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD and the remainder are in good health </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analyses of the data disclosed a number of pretransplant factors associated with engraftment, GVHD, and one-year survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The most important finding was that the use of male donors was preferable to female donors because of a higher rate of engraftment, less severe GVHD, and a higher one-year survival rate </plain></SENT>
