<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Polymerase chain reaction analyzing allele length polymorphisms was used to determine the origin of immunomagnetically isolated megakaryocytes and leukocyte subpopulations after SCT in 13 children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eleven were unselected consecutive cases while two were included due to known leukocyte mixed chimerism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recipient DNA was detected in the megakaryocytes in six out of the 11 cases at levels between 1 and 100% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Coinciding mixed chimerism in the leukocyte populations was detected in two of the 11 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the two selected cases with known leukocyte mixed chimerism, two boys with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043194" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome</z:e> had 1-5 and 70% recipient megakaryocytes, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although the four relapses or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, within the 13 months of observation, were restricted to patients with multilineage or isolated megakaryocyte (n = 1) mixed chimerism, it was not possible to link any other apparent clinical problems, except a prolonged <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> in one case, to the mixed chimerism in this limited study group </plain></SENT>
