<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Retrospectively we analyzed the histocompatibility data and clinical results of bone marrow transplantation in 51 patients who received marrow from unrelated donors (UD) from 1977 to 1987 at one of four UK BMT centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We compared the results with those obtained in 51 transplants carried out at the same centers using HLA-identical (ID) sibling donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of the UD/recipient pairs 32 (63%) were serologically identical for HLA A, B, and DR antigens, and 37% showed varying degrees of mismatch </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>UD-BMT primary diagnoses were: severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> or Fanconi's <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (n = 17), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> (n = 11), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (n = 21), and other conditions (n = 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>T cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of the graft was associated with a significant improvement in survival in both UD and ID-BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Graft failure was more common in recipients of UD than of ID transplants (13 [25%] vs. 5 [10%] P = 0.05) but there was no significant difference in the frequency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Actuarial survival was superior for recipients of ID transplants (UD vs. ID: 49% vs. 78%, respectively, at 3 months; 32% vs. 63% at one year) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Reduced survival for recipients of UD-BMT was confirmed in case control regression analysis (relative risk 3.0, P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless in patients whose only alternative is a partially mismatched family donor we think that UD-BMT is justified </plain></SENT>
