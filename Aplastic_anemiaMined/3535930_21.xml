<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> were conditioned with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (200 mg/kg) and given marrow grafts from HLA-identical family members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among 233 patients transplanted, 225 survived greater than or equal to 14 days and could be evaluated for engraftment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty-four of the 225 rejected their graft; 33 of these died and 11 survive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One hundred eighty-one patients had sustained engraftment; of these, 46 died and 135 survived </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Binary logistic regression analyses revealed five risk factors for graft rejection: year of transplant, a large number of platelet transfusions, a positive relative response in mixed leukocyte culture, a low marrow cell dose, and omission of donor buffy coat cell infusion for transfused patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data show that patients transplanted recently had a lower likelihood of graft rejection than did patients transplanted in earlier years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Conceivably, this was related to changes in transfusion practices, but other factors as yet unidentified are likely to be involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The data confirm that the largest possible number of marrow cells should be transplanted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although the difference in the incidence of graft rejection between untransfused and transfused patients was not significant, it should be noted that transfused patients were given buffy coat cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Because the addition of buffy coat cells results in a higher incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> graft-v-host disease (GVHD), it is still desirable to transplant patients with marrow alone early in their course before they have been transfused </plain></SENT>
