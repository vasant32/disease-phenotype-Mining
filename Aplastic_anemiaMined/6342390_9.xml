<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two subjects initially had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, and the remainder had idiopathic <z:mp ids='MP_0005638'>hemochromatosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four of the ten patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Six patients had subnormal <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> levels; FSH levels were almost uniformly low, but LH concentrations were more variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only three patients had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="51" ids="17347">testosterone</z:chebi> responses to hCG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000821'>Hypothyroidism</z:hpo>, free T4 less than 0.9 ng/dl, was present in 4 subjects, and the etiology was <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Basal prolactin levels were elevated in 2 patients and failed to respond adequately to TRH in 2 other patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Growth hormone reserve was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but 1 patient, and pituitary-adrenal reserve was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that disturbances in both pituitary and end-organ function are observed in <z:mp ids='MP_0005638'>hemochromatosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000135'>Hypogonadism</z:hpo> is almost universal, and is a consequence of defective function of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis and/or primary Leydig cell disturbance </plain></SENT>
