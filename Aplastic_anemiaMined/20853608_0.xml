<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To analyze the efficiency of transplantation of the bone marrow from a HLA-compatible unrelated donor and continued immunosuppressive therapy (IST) in children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) unresponsive to 2 courses of IST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The study enrolled 14 children aged 2-16 years (median 9 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A control group comprised 26 patients in whom IST was continued </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median interval between the diagnosis of AA and transplantation was 26 months (9-156 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The conditioning regimen consisted of thoracoabdominal irradiation in a dose of 2 Gy, fludarabin (Flu) 100-150 mg/m2, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (Cy) 100-200 mg/kg, antithymocyte globulin (ATG) in 11 patients and Flu, Cy, and ATG in 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A graft-versus-host reaction was prevented with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="168396">mycophenolate</z:chebi> mefetil in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients, tacrolimus in 11, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> in 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Donors were compatible for high-resolution typing of 10/10 and 9/10 alleles in 8 and 6 patients, respectively; the source of a transplant was bone marrow in 13 patients and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor-mobilized peripheral blood precursors in one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirteen patients achieved primary engraftment after single transplantation; one patient did after repeat transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Grades I to II graft-versus-host reaction (GVHR) developed in 9 patients; postengraftment life-threatening <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> in 3, extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHR in 2, circumscribed GVHR in 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> fourteen hemopoietic cell transplant recipients followed for a median 17.5 months (range 1-71 months) were survivors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The likelihood of good survival after unrelated transplantations in AA is much higher than that after continued IST: 100% versus 15 +/- 11% </plain></SENT>
