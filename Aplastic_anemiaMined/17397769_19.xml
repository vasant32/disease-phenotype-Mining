<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is believed that most of this growth is attributable to off-label usage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To help ensure IVIG use is in keeping with an evidence-based approach to the practice of medicine, the National Advisory Committee on Blood and Blood Products of Canada (NAC) and Canadian Blood Services convened a panel of national experts to develop an evidence-based practice guideline on the use of IVIG for hematologic conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mandate of the expert panel was to review evidence regarding use of IVIG for 18 hematologic conditions and formulate recommendations on IVIG use for each </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A panel of 13 clinical experts and 1 expert in practice guideline development met to review the evidence and reach consensus on the recommendations for the use of IVIG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The primary sources used by the panel were 3 recent evidence-based reviews </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Recommendations were based on interpretation of the available evidence and where evidence was lacking, consensus of expert clinical opinion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A draft of the practice guideline was circulated to hematologists in Canada for feedback </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results of this process were reviewed by the expert panel, and modifications to the draft guideline were made where appropriate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This practice guideline will provide the NAC with a basis for making recommendations to provincial and territorial health ministries regarding IVIG use management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Specific recommendations for routine use of IVIG were made for 7 conditions including acquired red cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath>; acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0004313'>hypogammaglobulinemia</z:hpo> (secondary to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e>); fetal-<z:hpo ids='HP_0004809'>neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>; <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0014761" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemolytic disease of the newborn</z:e>; HIV-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>; <z:hpo ids='HP_0001973'>idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura</z:hpo>; and posttransfusion <z:hpo ids='HP_0000979'>purpura</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Intravenous immune globulin was not recommended for use, except under certain life-threatening circumstances, for 8 conditions including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1096116" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">acquired hemophilia</z:e>; <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272362" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">acquired von Willebrand disease</z:e>; <z:hpo ids='HP_0001890'>autoimmune hemolytic anemia</z:hpo>; <z:hpo ids='HP_0001904'>autoimmune neutropenia</z:hpo>; <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221123" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemolytic transfusion reaction</z:e>; <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221123" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemolytic transfusion reaction</z:e> associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sickle cell disease</z:e>; <z:hpo ids='HP_0005575'>hemolytic uremic syndrome</z:hpo>/thrombotic thrombocytopenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000979'>purpura</z:hpo>; and <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp>-associated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_654'>hemophagocytic syndrome</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Intravenous immune globulin was not recommended for 2 conditions (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation) and was contraindicated for 1 condition (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011874'>heparin-induced thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>For most hematologic conditions reviewed by the expert panel, routine use of IVIG was not recommended </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Development and dissemination of evidence-based guidelines may help to facilitate appropriate use of IVIG </plain></SENT>
