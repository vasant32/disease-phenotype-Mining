<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We reviewed the clinical courses of 38 children with acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patients were classified according to the severity criteria by the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare (JMHW) Study Group (22 severe, 15 moderate, 1 mild) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was observed only in severe cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eight of the non-severe cases progressed to severe in 0.5-125 months, and the long-term survival rate of non-severe AA did not differ from that of severe AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The frequency of lymphocytes in the bone marrow was significantly higher, and the peripheral blood neutrophil count was lower in patients who died within a year, and these patients should be treated as very severe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the JMHW Study Group criteria are useful for identifying AA patients with a poor prognosis, but even non-severe cases should be repeatedly evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sixteen of the 33 patients treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> and/or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1456831" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">anabolic steroids</z:e> (AS) showed hematological recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Bolus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi> (mPSL) therapy was effective in one of the 8 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Allogenic marrow transplant (BMT) was performed on 3 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One died from <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> and engraftment was not achieved in the other two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Trilineage recovery was obtained in 3 of 6 patients treated with rhG-CSF and rhEPO with or without AS, and hemopoiesis has been maintained 6-12 months after discontinuation in 2 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the other 3 patients, the neutrophil count showed transient increase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the treatment for severe AA patients, who have no sibling donor for BMT, should be started with the combination therapy including these cytokines </plain></SENT>
