<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our research has identified a biological active component in ginseng extract and the active component, panaxadiol <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26605">saponins</z:chebi> component (PDS-C), was isolated from total <z:chebi fb="1" ids="26605">saponins</z:chebi> of ginsenosides, and formulated into capsules named as Painengda </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We successfully obtained approval from State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA) of China in 2010 to conduct clinical trials of PDS-C as class-five new Chinese patent medicine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Phase I and phase II clinical trials of PDS-C and Painengda Capsule were carried out in the treatment of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> and agnogenic <z:mp ids='MP_0000221'>leukocytopenia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The composition and content of PDS-C have been analyzed and defined by high-performance liquid chromatography-chromatographymass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) and HPLC using specific monomers of ginsenosides as the reference standards. mass PDS-C is very efficacious for treating mice and rats with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854467" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myelosuppression</z:e> caused by chemotherapy or radiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our animal model studies and cell biology and molecular biology experiments demonstrated that PDS-C possessed dual activities, namely that of promoting proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells, and that of regulating the immune function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>PDS-C and Painengda Capsule as a new Chinese patent medicine have been successfully transferred to industry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We believe that PDS-C is effective and safe in the treatment of refractory hemocytopenia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The advantages are that it is effective in small doses, it is convenient to use because of its oral administration, its lack of adverse events, it could be used alone or in combination with pharmacological agents, which improve the efficacy and decrease adverse events </plain></SENT>
