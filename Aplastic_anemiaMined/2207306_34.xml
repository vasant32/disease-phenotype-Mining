<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Doses ranging from 250 micrograms/m2 to 500 micrograms/m2 were administered as subcutaneous bolus injections daily for 15 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An increase in platelet counts from 1,000/microL to 31,000/microL was induced by rhIL-3 in one patient, and an increase in reticulocyte counts by more than 10,000/microL in four patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The blood leukocyte counts temporarily increased in eight patients 1.5- to 3.3-fold (median, 1.8-fold), mainly due to an increase in the number of neutrophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In two patients, bone marrow cellularity increased from 7% to 33% and from 10% to 80%, respectively, but without resulting in a substantial improvement of peripheral blood counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mild side effects (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and flushing) were observed in some patients, while <z:hpo ids='HP_0011134'>low-grade fever</z:hpo> occurred in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> necessitating discontinuation of rhIL-3 treatment occurred in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, rhIL-3 can stimulate hematopoiesis in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>; however, no lasting effects were obtained </plain></SENT>
