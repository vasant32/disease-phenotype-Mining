<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and 13 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> were studied 36 to 1547 days after treatment with high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> and/or total-body irradiation and marrow transplantation from HLA identical siblings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Peripheral blood lymphocytes from patients and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normals</z:mpath> (marrow donors and healthy unrelated individuals) were tested for cell inhibition (CI) of cultured skin fibroblasts from both patients and donors by using the microcytotoxicity assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, blocking of CI by factors in patient serum was studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three groups of patients were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients in group I were stable long-term survivors without evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-vs-host diseases</z:e> (GVHD) between 250 to 1547 days postgrafting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients in group II were short-term survivors with or without <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD between 36 and 144 days postgrafting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients in group III had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD either at the time of testing or developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD subsequent to CI testing between days 61 and 960 postgrafting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eleven of 14 patients in group I showed absence of both CI and serum blocking and three showed CI and blocking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients in group II without <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD showed absence of CI and serum blocking on three occasions, presence of CI and blocking on four occasions, and CI without blocking on three occasions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients in group II with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD showed absence of CI on one occasion and presence of CI and blocking on three occasions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients in group III showed absence of CI and blocking on seven occasions and CI without blocking on two occasions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the maintenance of stable graft-host tolerance in long-term survivors after marrow grafting from HLA identical donors does not depend on the presence of serum-blocking factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Short-term survivors with and without GVHD showed a spectrum of in vitro reactivity with 50% of the patients showing serum-blocking factors, and these results did not appear to be correlated with presence or absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Finally, results of the microcytotoxicity assays failed to provide insight into the mechanism of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD </plain></SENT>
