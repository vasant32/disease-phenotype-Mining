<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Within one year, benefits of x-rays, such as visualization of fractures, and detriments, such as x-ray <z:hpo ids='HP_0000964'>dermatitis</z:hpo>, were recognized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nobel Laureates Pierre and Marie Sklodowska Curie discovered the radioactive element <z:chebi fb="16" ids="33325">radium</z:chebi> in 1898, and a year later the application of radiation to cure <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> was reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A significant price was paid for this: Marie Curie died of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> related to her radiation exposure, and her daughter Irene Joliot Curie, Nobelist for radiochemical research, died of radiation-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Internationally developed radiation protection recommendations were formalized starting in the late 1920s </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The increasing use of ionizing radiation in medical diagnosis and radiation therapy has brought significant societal benefits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Known risks of therapeutic radiation include <z:hpo ids='HP_0001677'>coronary artery disease</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751623" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, recently concerns have been raised of possible very small but incremental increases in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> due to diagnostic medical radiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients are largely unaware of, and referring physicians and even radiologists often underestimate, the carcinogenic effects of radiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There is a need to determine the appropriateness of imaging tests that use ionizing radiation prior to performance; optimize imaging protocols to reduce unnecessary radiation; include patients in the decision process and encourage and enable them to track their radiation exposure; and promote education about medical radiation to patients, referring physicians, radiologists, and members of the public </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The basic radiation protection principles of justification, optimization, and application of dose limits still pertain </plain></SENT>
