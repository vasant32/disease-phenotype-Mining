<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The disease was first described in 1938, in four patients reported by Diamond and Blackfan, followed by a number of longitudinal studies and reviews of approximately 175 well-documented cases and/or unpublished records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The typical patient presents in infancy (median 1 month of age) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000980'>pallor</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In as many as 30% of the patients there is an inconsistent pattern of congenital anomalies of the heart, integument, musculoskeletal system, and kidneys </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although its congenital nature is firmly established, the pathophysiology is still unknown, and it is likely that there are multiple biochemical or cellular defects producing the same clinical syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>That the disease is genetically determined is suggested by some cases accompanied by congenital anomalies, by racial differences--only a few blacks and one Asian have been described--and by multiple occurrences in some families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The number of such families is small, and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>mode of inheritance</z:hpo> appears inconsistent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this report is to emphasize the apparently variable genetics of a disease which is undoubtedly variable in its clinical expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We describe the unique occurrence of CHA in half-siblings of opposite sex, both with moderately severe disease, transmitted by a healthy female </plain></SENT>
