<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In addition to a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three cell lineages and the sinuses, atypias were observed in the maturing erythroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These aberrations of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> development consisted mainly of deep invaginations of the nuclear envelope in proerythroblasts and conspicuous nuclear clefts in erythro- and normoblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In comparison with similar changes in dyserythropoietic and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> as well as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> these alterations are discussed in connection with disturbances of DNA synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Further atypias involved megakaryopoiesis which displayed microforms probably as an evidence for maturation arrest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These ultrastructural abnormalities and their morphological features of a neoplastic proliferation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three cell lineages in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001901'>Polycythemia</z:hpo> vera are in good agreement with the new concept of a transformation of a pluripotent stem cell with clonal character </plain></SENT>
