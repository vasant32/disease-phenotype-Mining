<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>FA is genetically <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> with at least 8 genes being implicated on the basis of functional complementation studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To date, six FA genes are known: FANCA, FANCC, FANCD2, FANCE, FANCF and FANCG, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of which encode orphan proteins sharing no homology to each other nor to any other known protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, they do not appear to possess any domains with homology to currently known protein domains, which makes a prediction about their molecular action difficult </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Studying the molecular evolution of FA genes and their products using sensitive database search methods such as PSI-BLAST may provide novel insight into the nature of the FA pathway and its relationship to hematopoiesis, embryonic development and the origin of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Preliminary results of such an approach show that at least one FA protein, FANCG, may contain a known domain, suggesting that this protein is a member of the family of tetratricopeptide repeat-containing proteins </plain></SENT>
