<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>GM-CSF was given at the rate of 3.5-32 micrograms/kg for 2-64 days as a continuous infusion for the following indications: impending rejection following bone marrow transplantation (5 patients), severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> secondary to chemotherapy in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> patients (5), severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (3), immune <z:hpo ids='HP_0001913'>granulocytopenia</z:hpo> (2) and accidental overdose with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35610">cytostatic</z:chebi> agents (2 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Tolerance of GM-CSF was good in regard to doses of up to 16 micrograms/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>Fever</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003326'>myalgia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001880'>eosinophilia</z:hpo> were the most frequent side effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient treated with 32 micrograms/kg developed <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the vena cava </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Efficacy is more difficult to assess in this heterogenous population, but 11 of 17 patients showed increased granulocyte counts and 3 patients clearly recovered from severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The role of GM-CSF in this recovery, however, cannot be proven </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results further indicate that GM-CSF cannot reverse ongoing rejection following allogenic BMT and cannot correct immune <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The value of GM-CSF therapy in patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and in the context of chemotherapy still needs to be defined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is certainly indicated in patients with an accidental overdose of chemotherapeutic agents </plain></SENT>
