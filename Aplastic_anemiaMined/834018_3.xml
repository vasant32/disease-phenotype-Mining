<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While hematocrits increased from 22 to 27%, plasma ESF titers were found unchanged between 31 and 35 mU/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It can be excluded therefore that the improvement of erythropoiesis following initiation of dialysis was in part due to an increase in plasma ESF titers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The increased erythropoiesis observed is probably not dependent on increased ESF production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A 30-fold ESF deficit existed in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo> prior to the initiation of hemodialysis when compared with 5 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (hematocrit 23%, plasma ESF titer 1115 mU/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At one exception ESF titers up to 500 mU/ml were found in dialysed patients only in combination with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0240066" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron deficiency</z:e> </plain></SENT>
