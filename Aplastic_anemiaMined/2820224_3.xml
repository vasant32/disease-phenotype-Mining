<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Six of the 16 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> patients were complete responders to ATG therapy, two were partial responders, and eight failed to respond to ATG therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The proportion of E+, CD4, CD8, and surface Ig-positive cells did not correlate with in vitro lymphocyte functions nor clinical responses before or after ATG therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Lymphocyte proliferative responses to phytohemagglutinin, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039614" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tetanus</z:e> toxoid, alloantigens, or pokeweed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi> were generally present before and after ATG therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When pokeweed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019348" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herpes simplex</z:e> type I virus, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039614" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">tetanus</z:e> toxoid were used as probes to elicit in vitro Ig production using a hemolytic plaque assay, some patients had 1) B cells that failed to produce Ig, 2) T cells that failed to provide helper activity, and 3) T cells that exhibited excessive suppressor activity in the various antibody production systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These measures of immune function, however, did not correlate with clinical responses to ATG therapy </plain></SENT>
