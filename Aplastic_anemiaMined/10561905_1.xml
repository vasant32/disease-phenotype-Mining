<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This is the largest single epidemiologic study of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> ever performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The objectives have been to document the incidence of the disease and to study the etiologic factors in a case-control analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The overall incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> was 3.9 per million per year in Bangkok, two times higher than in the West; 3.0 per million in Songkla; and 5.0 per million in Khonkaen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A difference appears in the age incidence pattern between Bangkok and the two rural areas, with double incidence peaks at ages 15 to 24 and over 60 in Bangkok, yet a more steady increase in incidence with increasing age in the rural areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With regard to possible etiologic factors, there is a strong inverse association between incidence of the disease and socioeconomic status as determined by total household income and years of education </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There are also significant positive associations with occupational exposure to solvents and agricultural pesticides </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only a few drugs, including <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50264">thiazide</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="40" ids="35498">diuretics</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35358">sulfonamide</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6704">mebendazole</z:chebi> are associated with the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There continues to be no evidence of association with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17698">chloramphenicol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The etiologic fraction for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> associated drugs is lower than 5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Household <z:chebi fb="239" ids="25944">pesticide</z:chebi> use is not associated with the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Exposure to <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> A virus is a risk indicator for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and may be a surrogate marker for another enteric infectious agent </plain></SENT>
