<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, although <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> metabolites are known to induce <z:mp ids='MP_0003674'>oxidative stress</z:mp> and disrupt the cell cycle, the mechanism underlying lympho/leukemogenicity is not fully understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Caspase-4 (alias caspase-11) and -12 are inflammatory caspases implicated in <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp> and endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The objectives of this study were to investigate the altered expression of caspase-4 and -12 in mouse bone marrow after <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> exposure and to determine whether their alterations are associated with <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi>-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948168" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bone marrow toxicity</z:e>, especially cellular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, we evaluated whether the p53 gene is involved in regulating the mechanism, using both <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> (WT) mice and mice lacking the p53 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For this study, 8-week-old C57BL/6 mice [WT and p53 knockout (KO)] were administered a <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> solution (150 mg/kg diluted in corn oil) via oral gavage once daily, 5 days/week, for 1 or 2 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Blood and bone marrow cells were collected and cell counts were measured using a Coulter counter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Total <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein extracts were prepared from the harvested bone marrow cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Then qRT-PCR and Western blotting were performed to detect changes in the caspases at the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein level, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A DNA fragmentation assay and Annexin-V staining were carried out on the bone marrow cells to detect <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Results indicated that when compared to the control, leukocyte number and bone marrow cellularity decreased significantly in WT mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The expression of caspase-4 and -12 mRNA increased significantly after 12 days of <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> treatment in the bone marrow cells of <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi>-exposed p53KO mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> detection assays indicated no evidence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in p53KO or WT mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In addition, no changes of other <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-related caspases, such as caspase-3 and -9, were found in WT or p53KO mice at the level of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These results indicated that upregulation of caspase-4 and -12 in mice lacking the p53 gene is not associated with cellular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, caspase-4 and -12 can be activated by <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> treatment without inducing cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in mouse bone marrow, which are partly under the regulation of the p53 gene </plain></SENT>
