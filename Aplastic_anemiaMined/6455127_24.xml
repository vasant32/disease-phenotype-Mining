<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They were studied between 4 and 63 mo (median 14.2) after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seventeen patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (C-GVHD) and 7 were healthy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They were studied for defects in their T- and B-cell function using and indirect hemolytic plaque assay for Ig production after 6 days of culture in the presence of pokeweek <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>T or B cells from the patients with or without C-GVHD were cocultured with T or B cells from their HLA-identical marrow donors or unrelated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Intrinsic B-cell defects, lack of helper T-cell activity, and suppressor T-cell activity were more frequently found in patients with C-GVHD than in healthy patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fifteen of the 17 patients with C-GVHD showed on or more defects in their T-and B-cell function compared to only 3 of the 7 patients without C-GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>None of the healthy controls, including the marrow donors, showed defects in their T- and B-cell functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These in vitro findings may be helpful in assessing the process of immune reconstitution and the immunologic aberration found after human marrow transplantation </plain></SENT>
