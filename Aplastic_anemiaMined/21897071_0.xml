<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The revised WHO classification proposed the term "refractory cytopenia of childhood (<z:chebi fb="60" ids="47899">RCC</z:chebi>)" for children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) with a low blast count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The differential diagnosis between <z:chebi fb="60" ids="47899">RCC</z:chebi> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) is challenging, especially when bone marrow is hypoplastic and there is no detectable chromosomal abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To reveal the difference between AA and <z:chebi fb="60" ids="47899">RCC</z:chebi> with respect to the clinical and biological features, we retrospectively reviewed the bone marrow smears of 140 patients registered for childhood AA-97 study, which were classified into three groups as follows; the AA group was defined as having no morphologically dysplastic changes; the AA-<z:chebi fb="60" ids="47899">RCC</z:chebi> borderline group was defined as having &lt;10% dysplastic changes in the erythroid lineage only; and the <z:chebi fb="60" ids="47899">RCC</z:chebi> group was defined as having dysplastic changes in more than two cell lineages or &gt;10% in a single cell lineage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients were classified into the AA group (n=96, 69%), AA-<z:chebi fb="60" ids="47899">RCC</z:chebi> borderline group (n=20, 14%) and <z:chebi fb="60" ids="47899">RCC</z:chebi> group (n=24, 17%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most of the patients in the AA group were classified as having very severe disease, whereas most of the patients in the <z:chebi fb="60" ids="47899">RCC</z:chebi> group were classified as non-severe disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only 2 patients in the AA group developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The response rate to immunosuppressive therapy did not differ among the 3 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>To demonstrate whether the two diseases are truly different entities, it is necessary to compare molecular backgrounds between the AA and <z:chebi fb="60" ids="47899">RCC</z:chebi> groups </plain></SENT>
