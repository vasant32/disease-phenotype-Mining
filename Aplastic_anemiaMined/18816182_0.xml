<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most patients tolerate treatment well but some may develop life threatening side effects such as <z:mp ids='MP_0000334'>agranulocytosis</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We review <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50671">antithyroid drug</z:chebi> induced AA and describe, as illustrative cases, two women with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018213" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Graves' disease</z:e> who developed AA after 8 and 24 weeks of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="617099">carbimazole</z:chebi> (CBM) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50673">methimazole</z:chebi> (MMI) treatment respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENT FINDINGS AND SUMMARY: To date, at least 34 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) due to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50671">antithyroid drugs</z:chebi> [(1 with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3490">CMZ</z:chebi>, 31 with MMI, and 2 with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8502">propylthiouracil</z:chebi> (PTU)] have been published, not including the two patients described here </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, at least another 14 patients in whom AA developed after treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50671">antithyroid drugs</z:chebi> (11 with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3490">CMZ</z:chebi>, and 3 with MMI) have been reported in Yellow Card Scheme data analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with AA usually exhibit sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms after a relative short time of exposure to the drugs, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> have concomitant <z:mp ids='MP_0000334'>agranulocytosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most have a rapid recovery following discontinuation of the drug and supportive treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although only two <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50671">antithyroid drug</z:chebi> induced AA <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> have been published, the mortality rate was higher in the Yellow Card Scheme data analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>Aplastic anemia</z:hpo> associated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50671">antithyroid drug</z:chebi> treatment is rarer than <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50671">antithyroid drug</z:chebi> associated <z:mp ids='MP_0000334'>agranulocytosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The prognosis of patients with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50671">antithyroid drug</z:chebi> induced AA is good overall, but may not be as favorable as that of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50671">antithyroid drug</z:chebi> induced isolated <z:mp ids='MP_0000334'>agranulocytosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
