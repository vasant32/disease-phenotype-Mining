<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results, however, have been relatively poor for transplants from partially matched family donors or unrelated donors because of the high incidence of graft rejection and/or GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Six multiply transfused patients received a novel conditioning regimen of CY 200 mg/kg and TBI 800 cGy prior to receiving marrow from their HLA-haploidentical family donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three recipient-donor pairs were mismatched for one HLA locus, one for two loci and two for three loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A combination of MTX and CsA was used for GVHD prophylaxis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Engraftment was noted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> six patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> GVHD occurred in four patients, two each for grade I and II, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One patient, who was ABO-compatible with her donor had delayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of pure red cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> (PRCA) which completely recovered 6 months after additional immunotherapy with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were two <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>; both occurred while patients were on treatment for GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>One was from systemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085082" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fungemia</z:e> and the other probably from cytomegalovirus <z:hpo ids='HP_0006515'>interstitial pneumonitis</z:hpo> (CMV-IP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Four patients (66.7%) have been alive and disease-free for more than 8.2, 27.3, 38.4 and 47.2 months after BMT, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that CY/TBI-800 may be a simple and effective conditioning regimen for SAA patients receiving BMT from family members other than HLA-identical siblings </plain></SENT>
