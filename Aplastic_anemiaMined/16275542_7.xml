<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed the data of 65 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> who were tested for the galactomannan (GM) antigen of Aspergillus between March and November 2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: GM antigen levels were false-positive in at least two consecutive samples in 5 out of 23 patients who did not have evidence of invasive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004030" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aspergillosis</z:e> (false positivity rate of 21.7%) but who received concomitant <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8232">piperacillin</z:chebi>/tazobactam (P/T) compared to 0 of 28 patients who did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: The use of P/T in febrile, neutropenic patients decreases the specificity of GM antigen testing, which may lead to incorrect and unnecessary attempts at diagnosis and therapy </plain></SENT>
