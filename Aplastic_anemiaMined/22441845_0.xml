<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated 26 newly diagnosed patients of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) with GE-MRI of brain who were otherwise neurologically asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These patients were then further followed up for a period of 6 months for development of overt <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median age of patients was 20.5 years (range 12-40 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median values of complete blood counts at the time of diagnosis were <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> 5.7 gm/dl (range 2.5-9.2 gm/dl), white cell count 2,320/μl (800-7,000/μl), and platelet count 11,500/μl (7000-45,000/μl) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three patients were detected to have CMB while two patients had asymptomatic cerebral macrobleeds (&gt;1 cm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>During the follow-up period of 6 months, two patients developed spontaneous <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>None of the two patients had CMB at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, asymptomatic CMB were found in 11.5 % of patients with AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The overall prevalence of asymptomatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICH</z:e> (CMB &amp; macrobleeds) was 19.2 % </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further studies with larger number of patients are required to clearly delineate the association </plain></SENT>
