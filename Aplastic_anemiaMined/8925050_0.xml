<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A complex study of colony-stimulating properties of cells-precursors of granulomonocytopoiesis, morphological parameters of the marrow histological structures and immunological parameters was carried out in 90 patients to specify pathogenic mechanisms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>95% of patients appeared to have sharp decrease of the marrow colony-stimulating properties and only 5% had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> initial indexes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In most patients endostal cell number increased, while the content of reticulocytes grew higher in more than 30% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Defect of the marrow stroma functioning was registered in 23% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Increase of the osseous tissue volume and osteocyte number was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Dysbalance in cellular link of immunity was demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Only temporal increase of the marrow colony-stimulating properties was marked in some patients on the background of treatment with antilymphocyte globulin, despite the clinic-hematological improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multifactor pathophysiological mechanisms, the main of which is the stem cell defect lies in the base of AA pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Hemopoietic microenvironment pathology is not the leading reason of the hemopoiesis <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> but it contributes greatly in its development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Immunological alterations in patients with AA are secondary and can be partly corrected with treatment with ALG </plain></SENT>
