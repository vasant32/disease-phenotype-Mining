<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this report, the EPO data were analysed in relation to serum iron concentrations, with ferritin and UIBC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo>, there was no significant correlation between EPO concentration and serum iron, ferritin, nor UIBC concentration </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One was in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001891'>iron deficiency anemia</z:hpo>, whose serum EPO was negatively correlated to serum iron (r = -0.64) and ferritin (r = -0.59), but positively related to UIBC (r = 0.27) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The another was the pattern in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, whose serum EPO positively correlated to iron and ferritin but negatively correlated to UIBC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> serum EPO had good correlation to serum iron (r = 0.62), ferritin (r = 0.60) and UIBC (r = -0.46) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The relationship of EPO to iron in the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (r = 0.54), and EPO to ferritin in the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (r = 0.42) show significantly positive correlation coefficient.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
