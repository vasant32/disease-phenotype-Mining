<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In 87 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> who failed to respond to immunosuppressive treatment, we determined the minimal dose of total body irradiation (TBI) required when added to antithymocyte globulin (ATG, 30 mg/kg x 3) plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (CY, 50 mg/kg x 4) to achieve engraftment of unrelated donor marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>TBI was started at 3 x 200 cGy, to be escalated or deescalated in steps of 200 cGy depending on graft failure or toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients were aged 1.3 to 53.5 years (median, 18.6 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The interval from diagnosis to transplantation was 3 to 328 months (median, 14.6 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Donors were HLA-A, -B, -C, -DR, and -DQ identical for 62 patients, and nonidentical for 1 to 3 HLA loci at the antigen or allele level for 25 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The dose-limiting toxicity was diffuse pulmonary injury </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The optimum TBI dose was 1 x 200 cGy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nine patients did not tolerate ATG and were prepared with CY + TBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Graft failure occurred in 5% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up of 7 years, 38 (61%) of 62 HLA-identical, and 10 (40%) of 25 HLA-nonidentical transplant recipients are surviving </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The highest survival rate with HLA-identical transplants was observed at 200 cGy TBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Thus, low-dose TBI + CY + ATG conditioning resulted in excellent outcome of unrelated transplants in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> who had received multiple transfusions </plain></SENT>
