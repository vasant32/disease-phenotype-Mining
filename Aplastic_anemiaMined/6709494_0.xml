<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The increase in GM-CFC growth after E rosette (+) cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> was high in 8 cases, suggesting that in these cases an autoimmune mechanism may have been involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> these patients responded within a month to treatment with antithymocyte globulin (ATG) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Six patients did not respond to immunotherapy, none showed increased GM-CFC growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The increase of in vitro GM-CFC growth after E rosette (+) cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> could therefore be a good indication for the trial of immunotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However this study seems to be useful only in patients with at least a few months evolution after diagnosis </plain></SENT>
