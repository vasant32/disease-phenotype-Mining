<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Colony assays were performed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53448">methylcellulose</z:chebi> culture methods added with 1 to 500 units of rh-Ep </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow, the maximum CFU-E colony formation was observed at 2 to 5 units of rh-Ep, and BFU-E at 2 to 10 units </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Colonies did not increase by addition of higher titer of rh-Ep to the cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, the numbers of CFU-E and BFU-E were low at 2 units of rh-Ep in culture system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In most patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> studied, erythroid colonies were increased in accordance with the increase of rh-Ep added to cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the administration of high titers of rh-Ep in vivo may be useful for the improvement of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
