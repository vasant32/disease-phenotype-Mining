<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Because of the variety of definitions used to describe moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="8" ids="35738">MAA</z:chebi>), we review our institutional experience period with patients who met a proposed set of criteria for this disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On an exploratory basis, we sought to evaluate the influence of treatment with immunosuppressive therapy (IST) versus observation on long-term outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Records from 1999 to 2010 were screened for patients who met the criteria for <z:chebi fb="8" ids="35738">MAA</z:chebi>: (1) bone marrow cellularity of 20% to 50%; (2) cytopenias in at least 1 cell line (absolute neutrophil count&lt;1000/µL, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>&lt;9 g/dL, platelet count&lt;100,000/µL); (3) mean corpuscular volume ≥90; (4) persistence &gt;6 months; and (5) negative Fanconi studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Data were collected for patient/disease characteristics, treatments, and outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eight patients met the criteria for <z:chebi fb="8" ids="35738">MAA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three of 8 patients received IST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of 3 patients who received IST, complete response was observed in 2 and transfusion independence in 1, as compared with 2 of 5 and 3 of 5 in the group who were observed without IST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Median duration of follow-up was 48 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: As several patients spontaneously resolved, and none developed severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, the criteria used here may identify a group of children with favorable prognosis who can be managed supportively </plain></SENT>
