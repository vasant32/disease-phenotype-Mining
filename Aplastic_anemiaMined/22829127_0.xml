<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>One of the major obstacles of immunosuppressive therapy (IST) in children with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (SAA) comes from the often months-long unpredictability of bone-marrow (BM) recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this prospective study in children with newly diagnosed very severe AA (n=10), who were enrolled in the therapy study SAA-BFM 94, we found a dramatically reduced diversity of both CD4+ and CD8+ BM cells, as scored by comprehensive V-beta chain T-cell receptor (TCR) analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Strongly skewed TCR V-beta pattern was highly predictive for good or at least partial treatment response (n=6, CD8+ complexity scoring median 35.5, range 24-73) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, IST in patients with rather moderate reduction of TCR V-beta diversity (n=4, CD8+ complexity scoring median 109.5, range 82-124) always failed (P=0.0095) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>If confirmed in a larger series of patients, TCR V-beta repertoire in BM may help to assign children with SAA up-front either to IST or to allogeneic stem-cell transplantation </plain></SENT>
