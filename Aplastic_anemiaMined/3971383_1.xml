<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cells grew in suspension in liquid culture and were dependent for their continuous replication in vitro on growth factors produced by the same cells seeded at high density </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Initially, undifferentiated blasts, immature myeloid, megakaryocytic and, rarely, erythroid cells were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eventually, a population of cells with characteristics of monocyte-macrophage precursors predominated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These cells could be induced to terminal macrophage differentiation by incubation with the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> promoter 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-<z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During this period (over 150 continuous passages), the cells failed to form colonies in agar and to give rise to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> when inoculated into athymic mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On prolonged passages, however, the cells gradually increased their growth capacity in liquid culture and became capable of forming colonies in agar and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumors</z:e> in animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ultrastructural studies revealed that the expression of differentiated traits markedly changed as a function of time: after 277 passages, the transformed cells, although displaying characteristics of monocyte precursors, appeared blocked at this stage and no longer responded to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-<z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
