<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The serum TPO levels were measured with a sensitive sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The serum TPO level in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> group (1.68 +/- 0.85 fmol/ml) were not significantly increased compared with those of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The TPO levels in the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> (2.77 +/- 1.38 fmol/ml) and HUS groups (5.77 +/- 4.41 fmol/ml) were higher than those of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients with AA (12.7 +/- 8.0 fmol/ml) and those with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi> (13.3 +/- 5.7 mol/ml) had significantly higher serum TPO levels than did the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The TPO levels were well correlated with the platelet counts in the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="18284">TTP</z:chebi> patients, and were negatively correlated with the platelet counts in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the serum TPO levels in some thrombocytopenic diseases are regulated not only by the platelet count and the megakaryocyte mass, but also by other factors </plain></SENT>
