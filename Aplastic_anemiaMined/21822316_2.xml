<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These reports demonstrate feasibility but likely do not reflect true outcomes due to a positive reporting bias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report herein the outcomes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> our pediatric recipients of allogeneic HSCT following previous solid-organ transplantation between 2000 and 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four children were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two patients underwent heart transplantation followed by cord-blood allogeneic HSCT for T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>/post transplant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024314" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphoproliferative disease</z:e> (PTLD) and two patients underwent liver transplantation followed by living-donor allogeneic HSCT for severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (SAA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean time between transplants was 4.2 years (range 1.5-6 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients engrafted; however, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients died from 37 days to 1 year after HSCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> included <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> (n=2), multi-organ failure (n=1) and solid-organ graft rejection (n=1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Though three patients survived beyond day+100, multiple complications were observed including EBV re-activation followed by EBV-positive PTLD (n=1) and five episodes of severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The patients transplanted for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> did not have evidence of recurrence at last follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although feasibilty has been shown with this cohort, we conclude that allogeneic HSCT in immunosuppressed patients following solid-organ transplantation remains a very high risk procedure that results in severe morbidity and mortality in children </plain></SENT>
