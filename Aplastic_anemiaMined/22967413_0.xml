<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The quantitative expression of WT1 transcript by using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) was performed in the bone marrow samples of 36 childhood <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and 49 childhood AA, the samples were collected from September 2008 to December 2011 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: (1) The positive rate of WT1 in severe AA (SAA) was 0, 14.3% in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> AA (CAA), 58.6% in refractory cytopenia (RC), 100% in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excessive blast (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>) and 97.5% in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean level of WT1 in SAA, CAA, RC, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> was 0.041%, 0.357%, 7.037%, 12.680% and 24.210%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The positive rate of WT1 in RC patients was higher than that of SAA (P = 0.000) and CAA (P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>(2) The positive rate of WT1 in patients with hypoplastic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> was 66.7% and was higher than that of SAA (P = 0.000) and CAA (P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean level of WT1 in patients with hypoplastic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> was (3.022 ± 5.040)% and higher than that of SAA \[(0.041 ± 0.047)%, P = 0.000\] and CAA\[(0.351 ± 0.479)%, P = 0.002\] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The level of WT1 in childhood <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> was higher than that of childhood AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The degree of WT1 expression in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> increased during disease progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>WT1 is a useful tool for differentiating the childhood hypoplastic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> from AA </plain></SENT>
