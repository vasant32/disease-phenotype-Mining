<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we describe a patient with HCL who initially presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> and received a diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patient was treated with immunosuppressive therapy including <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> A and anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No blood cell transfusion was required for approximately 3 years after ATG therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>She was referred to our hospital because of an abdominal mass and requiring periodic blood transfusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A bone marrow biopsy at this time revealed proliferation of lymphocytes with a fried egg appearance and an increase in reticulin fibers that are typical findings of HCL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is notable that our patient with a presumably long history of HCL and an increase in marrow reticulin fibers showed good recovery of hematopoiesis after cladribine therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Some HCL patients may receive an initial diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and may show a good response to ATG masking the underlying HCL </plain></SENT>
