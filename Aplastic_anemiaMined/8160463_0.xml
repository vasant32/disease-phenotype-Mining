<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Allogeneic transplantation is successful in these disorders, but carries a considerable risk to the recipient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Autologous transplantation becomes a reality when efficient gene transfer with sustained expression is developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As methods are developed to harvest hemopoietic stem cells from the peripheral blood and to amplify these cells without causing them to differentiate, transplantation will become increasingly valuable in the treatment of stem cell disorders </plain></SENT>
