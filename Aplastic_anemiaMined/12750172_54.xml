<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In FA subjects TNF-alpha was found to be increased in the serum and overproduced by patient-derived B-cell lines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, a disease in which, similarly to FA, marrow failure occurs, TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma act as late mediators of the stem cell damage and are overexpressed in patient marrow lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study evaluated in marrow mononuclear cells (MNCs) of patients with FA, the expression of negative modulators of the hematopoiesis, such as TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha (MIP-1alpha), and surface Fas ligand, and the role of TNF-alpha on FA erythropoiesis in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma were significantly overexpressed in stimulated marrow MNCs of FA patients as compared to healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MIP-1alpha and Fas ligand were undetectable in patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In bone marrow cultures, the addition of anti-TNF-alpha increased the size and significantly increased the number of erythroid colony-forming units and erythroid burst-forming units grown from FA patients but not from healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This indicates that FA subjects have a marrow TNF-alpha activity that inhibits erythropoiesis in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>TNF-alpha has a relevant role in the pathogenesis of erythroid failure in FA patients </plain></SENT>
