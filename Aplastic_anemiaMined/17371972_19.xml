<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, infusion of lymph node (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e>) cells from C57BL/6 mice into C.B10-H2(b)/LilMcd (C.B10) recipients that are mismatched at multiple minor histocompatibility Ags, including the immunodominant Ag H60, produced fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Declining blood counts correlated with marked expansion and activation of CD8 T cells specific for the immunodominant minor histocompatibility Ag H60 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Infusion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e> cells from H60-matched donors did not produce BM failure in C.B10 mice, whereas isolated H60-specific CTL were cytotoxic for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> C.B10 BM cells in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment with the immunosuppressive drug <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> abolished H60-specific T cell expansion and rescued animals from fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The development of BM failure was associated with a significant increase in activated CD4+CD25+ T cells that did not express intracellular FoxP3, whereas inclusion of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells in combination with C57BL/6 LN cells aborted H60-specific T cell expansion and prevented BM destruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, a single minor histocompatibility Ag H60 mismatch can trigger an immune response leading to massive BM destruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunosuppressive drug treatment or enhancement of regulatory T cell function abrogated this pathophysiology and protected animals from the development of BM failure </plain></SENT>
