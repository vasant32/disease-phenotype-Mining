<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CTLA4 is a T-lymphocyte surface molecule involved in the maintenance of immune tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Some polymorphisms associated with a reduced expression of CTLA4, and thus presumably with increased tendency to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo>, have been associated with various <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we evaluated the distribution of the low expression polymorphisms -318C &gt; T and 49A &gt; G of CTLA4 in a population of 67 patients with acquired AA and in 100 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in the distribution of the tested polymorphism between patients and controls and, within the patient group, between those who responded to immunosuppression vs those who did not respond </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This study indicates that the polymorphisms -318C &gt; T and 49A &gt; G of CTLA4 do not affect the risk of developing AA and do not influence the response to immunosuppression </plain></SENT>
