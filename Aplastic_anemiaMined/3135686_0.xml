<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This partially purified CSF caused significant <z:mp ids='MP_0000219'>neutrophilia</z:mp> in the peripheral blood of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mice by (a) single or continual intraperitoneal injection(s) in vivo, and also revealed a specific activity of 1.4 x 10(3) U/absorbance unit (AU) at 280 nm in vitro, with less than 1 ng/AU endotoxin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, this CSF induced faster recoveries of neutrophils in the peripheral blood and progenitor spleen cells of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (CY)-treated mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the CSF used in this study accelerated the differentiation of the granulocytic cells and the proliferation of granulocyte colony-forming units in the spleen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These effects contributed to a rapid recovery from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> in mice treated with CY </plain></SENT>
