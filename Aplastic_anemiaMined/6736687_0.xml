<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In an attempt to predict the clinical response to <z:chebi fb="5" ids="50113">androgens</z:chebi>, the effects of added <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5120">fluoxymesterone</z:chebi> (FMT) on the in vitro growth of marrow erythroid progenitors (CFU-E) were examined in 15 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and 6 control subjects with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> marrow <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the control group, the addition of FMT enhanced the growth of CFU-E in vitro, the maximum absolute increase being dependent on the basal number of CFU-E </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 10 out of the 11 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> patients who responded to <z:chebi fb="5" ids="50113">androgens</z:chebi> in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>FMT enhanced the growth of CFU-E in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this group, there was a positive correlation between the basal number of CFU-E and the maximum absolute increase of CFU-E induced by FMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In patients who did not respond to <z:chebi fb="5" ids="50113">androgens</z:chebi> in vivo, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> except one showed no increase in the growth of CFU-E in vitro by the addition of FMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, in four out of seven patients examined prior to <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi> therapy, the addition of FMT enhanced the in vitro growth of CFU-E </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">Androgen</z:chebi> therapy in vivo resulted in marked hematological improvements in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of these four patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two out of the remaining three patients in whom FMT did not enhance the in vitro growh of CFU-E failed to respond in <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that an in vitro CFU-E culture system to the presence of FMT may be helpful in predicting the response to <z:chebi fb="5" ids="50113">androgens</z:chebi> in vivo in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
