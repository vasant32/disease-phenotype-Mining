<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Increased expression of Fas by hematopoietic progenitors in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) suggests that Fas/Fas ligand (FasL) system plays a key role in the formation of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To further confirm the above hypothesis, T cells from 8 patients with AA were systematically studied for their FasL's distribution pattern, releasing manner and proapoptotic activity, compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> resting T cells and artificially activated T cell blasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results demonstrated that AA T cells abnormally expressed low levels of membrane-bound FasL and contained high levels of intracellular FasL which could be triggered to release by high-dose phytohemagglutinin (PHA) pulse-stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The supernatants from the PHA-stimulated AA T cells had apparent cytotoxicity against FasL-sensitive Jurkat cells, which could be significantly inhibited by monoclonal antibody against FasL in a dose-dependent manner, or nearly completely abrogated by ultracentrifugation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The above phenomena also appeared on artificially activated T cell blasts, but this was not the case on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> resting T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that AA T cell is a type of "preactivated" T lymphocyte, characterized by overexpression of FasL, especially intracellular FasL which can be stimulated to release in bioactive exosomes-bound form </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Taken together, our data provide further and direct evidence for the hypothesis that T cells might mediate the destruction of hematopoietic progenitor in AA through Fas/FasL system </plain></SENT>
