<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Recent reports have shown that killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR) and KIR ligand (KIR-L) genotype play a role in the pathophysiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disorders</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Certain KIR/KIR-L combinations might convey a predisposition to immune-mediated <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Examining the genotypic makeup of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I (KIR-L) and KIR in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521860" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic disorders</z:e> could offer clues to immunogenetic risk factors for these diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study is to establish the frequency of specific KIR genes and KIR-L alleles in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA), <z:hpo ids='HP_0004818'>paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), and large granular lymphocyte <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (LGL), as compared with healthy control patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: KIR genotyping was performed on DNA from 113 patients with AA, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, and LGL using sequence specific primer amplification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results of genotypic KIR analysis were examined with HLA typing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Comparisons in frequency of KIR-L groups, KIR genotype profiles, and KIR/KIR-L mismatch were performed to determine whether specific KIR genes and KIR-L are overrepresented in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> states </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No difference in frequency of KIR-L groups was found relative to the healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>AA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> showed decreased frequency of KIR-2DS1 and KIR-2DS5 genes: KIR-2DS1 35% vs 21% (p = 0.15) for AA and 19% for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> (p = 0.13); KIR-2DS5 31% vs 14% (p = 0.08) for AA and 12% (p = 0.06) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These differences were even greater when compared to a larger group of control individuals from a study with similar genetic background </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The reduced frequency of these KIR in AA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> may indicate an immunogenetic relationship between these diseases </plain></SENT>
