<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The natural history of EBV and CMV reactivation and the potential for serious complications following antibody-based immunosuppressive treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> syndromes in the absence of transplantation is not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We monitored blood for EBV and CMV reactivation by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) weekly in 78 consecutive patients (total of 99 immunosuppressive courses) with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four regimens were studied: (1) HC, horse ATG/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi>; (2) HCS, horse ATG/CsA/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">sirolimus</z:chebi>; (3) RC, rabbit ATG/CsA; and (4) CP, alemtuzumab </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were no cases of EBV or CMV disease, but EBV reactivation occurred in 82 (87%) of 94 and CMV reactivation in 19 (33%) of 57 seropositive patients after starting immunosuppression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median peak EBV copies were higher in the RC group when compared with HC, HCS, and alemtuzumab (P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median duration of PCR positivity for EBV was higher in the RC group compared with HC, HCS, and alemtuzumab (P = .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subclinical reactivation of both EBV and CMV is common and nearly always self-limited in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> receiving immunosuppression; different regimens are associated with different intensity of immunosuppression as measured by <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> load and lymphocyte count; and <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> reactivation patterns differ according to immunosuppressive regimens </plain></SENT>
