<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Carbamazepine, a widely used <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">anticonvulsant</z:chebi>, is associated with a wide range of adverse reactions including <z:mp ids='MP_0000334'>agranulocytosis</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0263591" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">drug-induced lupus</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It has also been reported to alter immune function in a variety of ways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We had previously demonstrated that carbamazepine is oxidized by activated neutrophils to several metabolites and this leads to covalent binding of the drug to the cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It appears that the major metabolite responsible for this binding is 9-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="36420">acridine</z:chebi> carboxyaldehyde </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study the effects on leukocyte function of carbamazepine and its leukocyte-generated metabolites were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Incubation of lymphocytes with 100 microM 9-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="36420">acridine</z:chebi> carboxaldehyde resulted in 40% cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> while carbamazepine at this concentration had no effect on viability </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The effect on the immune cell function was investigated using the autologous mixed lymphocyte reaction (AMLR), allogeneic mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR), lymphocyte transformation test (LTT) and mitogenesis assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Alteration of immune cell function by the reactive metabolite, 9-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="36420">acridine</z:chebi> carboxyaldehyde, was demonstrated by an increased proliferation at low concentrations (0.08-1.0 microM) and inhibition at high concentrations (20-100 microM) in the allogeneic MLRs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Carbamazepine had no measurable effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>9-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="36420">Acridine</z:chebi> appears to have more of an effect on B-cells since this augmentation-suppression phenomenon was also observed in mitogenesis assays with Staphylococcus aureus, a B-cell <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>, in contrast to mostly inhibition observed in the mitogenesis assay with phytohemagglutinin, a T-cell <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Again, carbamazepine had no measurable effects at comparable concentrations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
