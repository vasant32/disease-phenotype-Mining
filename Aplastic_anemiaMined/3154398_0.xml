<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>More than 9,500 transplants have been performed by 199 transplant teams worldwide; 162 are currently active </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The annual rate of allogeneic bone marrow transplants now exceeds 2,500 plus more than 1,000 autotransplants annually </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transplantation is an effective therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemias</z:hpo>; in some instances, it is the preferred treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, and some genetic and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021053" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">immune diseases</z:e>, bone marrow transplantation provides the only possibility for cure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow transplantation remains investigational in many conditions and is associated with substantial problems such as GvHD, <z:hpo ids='HP_0006515'>interstitial pneumonitis</z:hpo>, and the requirement for an HLA-identical donor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Recently an increasing number of transplants have been performed using HLA partially or fully matched, related or unrelated donors with some success </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The development of GvHD and <z:hpo ids='HP_0006515'>interstitial pneumonitis</z:hpo> can, to some extent, be predicted by risk-factor assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although GvHD can be prevented by depleting T cells from the donor bone marrow, this is associated with an increased risk of graft rejection and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0006515'>Interstitial pneumonitis</z:hpo> can be modified by prophylaxis with CMV-immune globulin and by the use of CMV-negative blood donors </plain></SENT>
