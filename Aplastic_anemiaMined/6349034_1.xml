<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A group of 18 patients was tested 6 months after BMT and another group of 10 patients was tested after one year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At 6 months after BMT, 94% of the patients had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> serum IgG and IgM levels, whereas at one year 29% of them had low IgA levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The proportion of patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphocyte responses in vitro at 6 months after BMT was 69% and 76% for the responses to concanavalin A and to soluble antigens; 75% and 53% for the responses to allogeneic cells and pokeweed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi>, respectively; and 89% for the response to phytohemagglutinin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> but one were able to generate suppressor cells upon con A stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At one year after the graft, only one patient had demonstrable multiple abnormalities in in vitro tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Skin test reactivity at one year was comparable to pre-graft reactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After BMT a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001888'>lymphopenia</z:hpo> persisted for 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The rate of infectious complications was high during the first 3 months after BMT, and it diminished progressively as immune functions returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Infection</z:e> was the cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> in two cases (one disseminated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010823" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cytomegalovirus infection</z:e> and one <z:mpath ids='MPATH_681'>septicemia</z:mpath>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>GHVD occurred in 12 patients; in nine of them the disease was transient and mild, only 1 patient developed severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In comparison to other studies, it seems that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> does not delay immune restoration, or increase morbidity from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, while preventing GVHD and its complications efficiently </plain></SENT>
