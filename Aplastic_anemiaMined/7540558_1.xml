<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While no deficiencies were found in SCF <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression, low levels of soluble SCF protein were measured in poorly growing AA stroma cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The SCF protein concentration in the supernatant and the confluence of AA stroma growth were found to correlate (R = 0.70) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Defective proliferation was observed in the majority (20/30) of AA stroma cultures and was paralleled by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001510'>poor growth</z:hpo> of homogeneous cultures of fibroblasts from the same marrow sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>AA stroma growth was enhanced by addition of exogenous SCF in combination with interleukin-11 (IL-11), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> inhibitory factor (LIF), and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrate that deficient growth of stroma cells results in decreased production of SCF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, SCF and other stroma-derived cytokines may be of therapeutic value in AA patients with documented defects within the BM microenvironment </plain></SENT>
