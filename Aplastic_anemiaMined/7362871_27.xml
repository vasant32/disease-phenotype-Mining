<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinical features of the GVHD included the development of exfoliative <z:hpo ids='HP_0000964'>dermatitis</z:hpo>, progressive hepatic dysfunction, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, and finally progressive fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>GVHD was documented by skin biopsy and chimerism by HLA typing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The HLA phenotype of the patient's skin fibroblasts [A3, Bw44 (w4)/A2, B15 (w4)] was appropriate for parental haplotypes and probably represented her true HLA phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lymphocytes from the patient (peripheral blood and lymph node biopsy) were of a different HLA phenotype (A3; Bw35, w38, w4, w6; Cw4), which was inappropriate for parental HLA haplotypes but identical to the HLA phenotype of one of the blood donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The HLA-DR typing of the patient's family and of the blood donor demonstrated that the patient and the donor probably were HLA-DR identical (DRw5/DRw6), although no B lymphocytes could be obtained from the patient for direct DR typing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We are currently irradiating <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> blood products administered to patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> receiving intensive treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further observations will be necessary to determine whether transfusions to other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> states should be restricted to irradiated blood products </plain></SENT>
