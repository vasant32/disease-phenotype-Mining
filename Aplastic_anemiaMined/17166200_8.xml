<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since January 1, 2001, its use in cosmetics has been banned </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This ban is as a result of mid-term effects such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0494871,C0162835" disease_type="Pathologic Function;Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">leukoderma</z:e>-en-confetti/occupational <z:hpo ids='HP_0001045'>vitiligo</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1444199" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">exogenous ochronosis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, a recent literature search on <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17594">hydroquinone</z:chebi> as a skin lightening agent suggests that possible long-term effects such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> may be expected as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Metabolites of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17594">hydroquinone</z:chebi> formed in the liver, e.g., p-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16509,39439">benzoquinone</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> conjugates of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17594">hydroquinone</z:chebi>, are mainly responsible for this </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the bone marrow, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17594">hydroquinone</z:chebi> is oxidized into p-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16509,39439">benzoquinone</z:chebi> because of the high myeloperoxidase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Topically applied <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17594">hydroquinone</z:chebi>-containing creams may give rise to accumulation of these compounds, which can cause DNA damage and mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>They also have the capability to disrupt protective mechanisms, whereby they facilitate further development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the bone marrow, long-term effects such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemias</z:hpo> may occur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Most of the evidence stems from research on <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> toxicity, which appears to arise via its metabolite <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17594">hydroquinone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There is no report yet demonstrating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> resulting from the application of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17594">hydroquinone</z:chebi>-containing creams </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However doctors should be aware of these potential health risks which were up until now disregarded </plain></SENT>
