<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results showed that these patients were short of specificity in clinical manifestation and hemogram, however, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases possessed multiple SLE-related autoantibodies, increase of serum globulin level and varying extent dermal and arthral signs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The incidence of primary or initial symptom in the 92 cases was as follow: 65 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (72.8%), 39 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000979'>purpura</z:hpo> (42.4%), 17 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001878'>hemolytic anemia</z:hpo> (18.5%), 56 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001882'>leukopenia</z:hpo> (60.9%), 54 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> (58.7%), and 41 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> (44.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The bone marrow examinations showed that the cellularity of nucleated cells was mostly <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, and active proliferation in 57 cases (61.9%) and hypercellularity in 35 cases (38.1%); the G/E ratio was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in majority, and G/E ratio &gt; 3 in 59 cases (64.1%) and &lt; 3 in 33 cases (35.9%) and G/E &lt; 1 in 17 cases with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001878'>hemolytic anemia</z:hpo> Coombs' test positive; megakaryocyte counts were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in 11 cases (11.9%), increase in 80 cases (86.9%) and lower than 7/marrow smear in 1 case (1.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neutrophil alkaline phosphatase staining was negative in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>From above data it is concluded that patients with SLERHD are varied in clinical and blood pictures, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients are provided with multiple SLE-related autoantibodies, globulinemia and dermal and arthral signs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is easy to identify SLERHD from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001973'>idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001890'>autoimmune hemolytic anemia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272126" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Evans' syndrome</z:e> by comprehensive and detailed clinical and laboratory examinations </plain></SENT>
