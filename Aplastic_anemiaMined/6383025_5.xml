<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of the 16 HLA-identical recipients, 14 were conditioned with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, 200 mg/kg, and two received 10 Gy total body irradiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One HLA-nonidentical recipient received 123 mg/kg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> and 10 Gy total body irradiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the 14 patients conditioned with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> alone, one died on day 49 after graft rejection, and 13 had sustained engraftment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Six of the 13 developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD), which led to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0029118" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">opportunistic infections</z:e> 84, 97, and 130 days after transplantation in three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four of the 13 developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD, two without preceding <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Currently, ten of the 14 cyclophosphamide-conditioned patients are alive 0.9-12.4 (median 5.9) years from transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The two HLA-identical recipients conditioned for grafting with total body irradiation died after failure of engraftment, and one also developed concomitant hepatic venocclusive disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mismatched recipient conditioned with radiation and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> died of severe GVHD 18 days posttransplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that survival, graft rejection, and incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD after marrow transplantation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo>-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> are similar to those of patients transplanted for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> of other etiologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Previous hepatic damage from <z:hpo ids='HP_0006562'>viral hepatitis</z:hpo> and liver function abnormalities existing at the time of grafting do not appear to increase the risk of posttransplant morbidity and mortality from hepatocellular damage or venocclusive disease in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>-conditioned patients </plain></SENT>
