<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 54 patients, who were diagnosed as acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> in West China Hospital of Sichuan University when it was from February 2006 to March 2007, and simultaneously 51 healthy adults were enrolled as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control for this project </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The polymerase chain reaction and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53656">polyacrylamide</z:chebi> gel electrophoresis were used to assay the polymorphism of CA short tandem repeat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The frequency of the homozygous for 12-12 (CA) repeats or the single allele 12 (CA) repeats of the patients was 18.52% or 50.92% respectively, which was obviously higher than the control group's frequency which was 2.00% or 26.47% (P = 0.008, P &lt; 0.001 respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The frequency of the homozygous for 12 (CA) repeats or the single allele 12 (CA) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> group was 12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>00% or 48.00%, while in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> group that frequency was 24.14% or 53.45%, the statistic analysis showed there was no significant difference between those two groups (chi2 = 1.311, P = 0.252, chi2 = 0.319, P = 0.572) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study suggests that: IFN-gamma CA short tandem repeat polymorphism is associated with the susceptibility of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> but has no relation to the severity of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
