<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study was undertaken to evaluate in a primarily pediatric population whether the late effects of bone marrow transplantation (BMT) on pulmonary function in patients having undergone the procedure for treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> are worse than that of patients having undergone transplant for treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Forty-six patients were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We did not demonstrate statistically significant differences in group mean forced expiratory flow in one second/forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC) and percentage predicted forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory flow at 25-75% of the forced vital capacity (FEF25-75) and total lung capacity (TLC) values between the two groups of patients before BMT and to 7 years post-transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Individual patients with pulmonary function abnormalities were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, there were no significant differences between the two study groups or within the group of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> from pre-transplant to 9-12 months and from pre-transplant to 18-24 months after BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, within the group of patients treated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, there was a significant decline in the group mean percentage predicted FVC (p = 0.0001), FEV1 (p = 0.0006) and FEF25-75 (p = 0.0063) from pre-transplant to 9-12 months and in the FVC (p = 0.004) and FEV1 (p = 0.0006) from pre-transplant to 18-24 months after BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The greater decline in the FVC relative to the FEV1 suggests the development of a restrictive process in this group of patients </plain></SENT>
