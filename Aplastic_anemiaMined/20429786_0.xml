<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is a need for the development of new, more effective and less toxic therapies for treating AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The safety and efficacy of an immune cell-based therapy for AA was examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-one patients with idiopathic AA received intravenous infusions of ex vivo-activated autologous and allogeneic immune cells at least once a week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Response to therapy was assessed by symptoms, transfusion dependency, blood counts, bone marrow biopsy and survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 31 patients, 25 (81%) had either complete (11, 35%) or partial (14, 45%) responses, while six (19%) showed no response to the therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The overall survival rates at 3 years were 90% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The therapy described appears to be safe and effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The data from this pilot study suggest that a larger, controlled study is warranted </plain></SENT>
