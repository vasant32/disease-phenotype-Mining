<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty-one IRP patients, 10 severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (SAA) patients and 13 healthy controls were enrolled in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The categories of auto-antibodies (IgG, IgM) on BMMNC (CD(34)(+)/CD(15)(+)/GlycoA(+) hematocytes), the quantity (CD(68)(+)/CD(45)(+))% and expression of antigen activated (CD(69)) of MPhi (CD(68)(+)CD(69)(+)/CD(+)(68))% in bone marrow of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases and controls were measured by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The quantity and expression ratio of activated antigen of bone marrow (BM) MPhi in IRP patients [(0.57 +/- 0.30)% and (40.30 +/- 18.49)%] were respectively significantly higher than those in SAA [(0.46 +/- 0.08)% and (32.44 +/- 19.37)%] and healthy controls [(0.44 +/- 0.69)% and (29.71 +/- 11.67)%] (both P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The quantity presented high-positive correlation with the expression ratio of activated antigen of BM MPhi (r = 0.89, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with IRP were classified into two subgroups according to the quantity of MPhi: Group A (MPhi &gt;/= 0.5%, 34 cases) and Group B (MPhi &lt; 0.5%, 27 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirty-two cases (94.12%) were with auto antibody (IgG) in Group A, while only 2 (7.41%) with auto antibody (IgG) in Group B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was significant difference in expression ratio of activated antigen of BM MPhi between Group A (49.19 +/- 16.63)% and Group B (29.11 +/- 14.30)% (P &lt; 0.05), but no difference was found between Group B and the control group (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Total curative rates at 3 and 6 month (47.06% and 79.41%) of Group A were better than those of Group B (22.22% and 51.85%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thirty-four IRP patients with autoantibody (IgG)(+) were divided into two subgroups according to the quantity of MPhi: high level group (&gt;/= 0.75%, 9 cases) and low level group (&lt; 0.75%, 25 cases), 24 cases (96%) in MPhi low level group were found auto-antibody (IgG) on one hemotopoietic cell lineage, 1 on two lineages, while 8 (88.89%) in MPhi high level group were detected auto-antibody (IgG) on two cell lineages, and 1 on three cell lineages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Expression ratio of activated antigen (56.12 +/- 15.11)% was much higher in MPhi high level group than that in MPhi low level group (44.58 +/- 18.16)% (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The count of red blood cell concentration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> and platelet in peripheral blood in MPhi high level group were respectively lower than those in MPhi low level group, while the percentage of Ret, the level of total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> and indirect <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi>, the ratio of erythroid of sternal bone marrow in MPhi high level group were higher than those in MPhi low level group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The expression of activated antigen of BM MPhi was enhanced in IRP especially with auto-antibody (IgG), which might be involved in damage process of hemotopoietic cell </plain></SENT>
