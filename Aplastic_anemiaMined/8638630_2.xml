<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There is some evidence that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> may be due to suppression of hematopoiesis by activated T-suppressor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressive agents</z:chebi> have been used as an alternative to bone marrow transplantation for treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report on a unique case of a patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> who was treated with a course of immunosuppression including <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> (CSA), anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG), and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five months after this treatment, the patient developed a B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorder</z:hpo> which was successfully treated with radiation therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Prior reports of CSA-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo> have appeared in the literature as potential side effects of immunosuppression following transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This is the first report of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorder</z:hpo> associated with immunosuppressive treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> in a nontransplant setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, when presenting options for treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorders</z:hpo> should be included as a rare complication of immunosuppressive therapy </plain></SENT>
