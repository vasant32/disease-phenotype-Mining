<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: 142 consecutive SAA patients were randomized to receive one of the following IST regimens: equine anti-human thymocyte immunoglobulin (E-ATG) alone (IST regimen I); E-ATG and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> A (CSA) (IST regimen II); E-ATG, CSA plus recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rhuGM-CSF) and rhu erythropoietin (rhuEPO) (IST regimen III); or rabbit ATG (ATG-F), CSA, rhuGM-CSF, and rhuEPO (IST regimen IV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>No repeated courses of E-ATG or ATG-F were given for nonresponders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients also received stanozolol or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17347">testosteron</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17272">propionate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall response rate to IST regimen I was 58% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The response to IST regimen II (79%) was significantly higher (p = 0.04), more rapid and complete than after IST regimen I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The response rate to IST regimen IV (53%) was significantly lower than that of IST regimen III (73%, p = 0.039) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The additional use of growth factors did not reduce early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> and did not accelerate hematopoietic recovery after IST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of the 142 patients enrolled in this trial, 92 (65%) are alive at a median follow-up time of 102 months (range, 54-166 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The 5-year actuarial survival for IST regimens I, II, III, and IV was 58%, 81%, 80%, and 66%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The combination of E-ATG and CSA remains the best combination for the treatment of SAA patients, producing a survival advantage at 5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The addition of growth factors did not improve these results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Rabbit ATG-F appeared less effective than E-ATG </plain></SENT>
