<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To evaluate whether the C677T and A1298C polymorphisms of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="12071">5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate</z:chebi> reductase (MTHFR) are related to the toxicity of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> (MTX) used in allogeneic stem cell transplantation, we performed association analysis between these genetic polymorphisms and the clinical outcomes of patients treated using human leukocyte antigen-matched sibling stem cell transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients (n=72) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0848852,C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancy</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> were given a short course of MTX as a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> prophylaxis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with the 677TT genotype showed higher total <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> levels (677TT vs 677CT vs 677CC, 14.5 vs 8.6 vs 3.8 mg/dl, respectively; p=0.07) and higher aspartic transaminase levels (677TT vs 677CT vs 677CC, 678.9 vs 156.6 vs 111.8 IU/l; p=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Platelet recovery to 20,000/mul was slower for patients with the 677TT genotype than for patients with other genotypes (677TT, 59 days; 677CT, 26 days; 677CC, 26 days; p=0.0075) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The influences of the C677T polymorphism on treatment-related mortality (TRM) were also analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One-year cumulative TRMs for patients with the TT genotype and the other genotypes were 66 and 30% (p=0.04) and their respective 1-year overall survivals were 30 and 56% (p=0.11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No association was observed between the A1298C polymorphism and clinical outcome for any of the different genotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, patients at high risk of developing hepatic toxicity and with a poor likelihood of survival could be selected by genotyping MTHFR C677T before allogeneic stem cell transplantation </plain></SENT>
