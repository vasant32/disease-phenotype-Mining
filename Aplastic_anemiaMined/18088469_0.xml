<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study was purpose to investigate the frequency of HLA-DRB1*15 expression in children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) and its relation to effect of immunosuppressive therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>HLA-DR genotypes were detected by SSP-PCR in 40 patients with acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and 107 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls, and the expressions of HLA-DR gene in AA patients and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>32 out of 40 patients were treated with immunosuppressive therapy, which included antilymphocyte globulin combining with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> alone, the relation of HLA-DRB1*15 expression to efficacy of immunosuppressive therapy and relapse of AA was explored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the mean age of the patients was 9.0 years with a ratio of male to female 1.5:1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The frequency of HLA-DRB1*15 genotype expression in patients with idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> was 51.5% (17/33), which was markedly higher than that of healthy controls (20.6%, p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of 7 patients with second acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> showed negative expression of HLA-DRB1*15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> responses, including complete remission and partial remission (CR+PR), and CR to immunosuppressive therapy in 16 patients who bared HLA-DRB1*15 were 93.8% and 87.5% respectively, which were higher significantly than those of patients without bearing HLA-DRB1*15 (56.3% and 31.3%, p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Relapse occurred in 5 patients who bared HLA-DRB1*15 genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the frequency of HLA-DRB1*15 genotype expression in children with AA is significantly higher than that in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls, and the immunosuppressive therapy for patients bared HLA-DRB1*15 shows favourable effect with high incidence of complete remission </plain></SENT>
