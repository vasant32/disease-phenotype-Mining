<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two leukaphereses of the donors yielded a median number of 10.1 x 10(10) nucleated cells (range 9.7-15.4) with a median number of 9.89 x 10(8) CD34+ cells (range 7.46-26.1) and a median percentage of CD34+cells of 0.98% (range 0.77-1.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After positive selection by magnetic cell sorting the patients received a median of 14.3 x 10(6) CD34+ cells/kg (range 11.7-24.3) and of 1.3 x 10(4) CD3+ cells/kg (range 0.57-5.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Median time to ANC &gt;/=0.5 x 10(9)/l was 7 days (range 7-12) and to platelets &gt;/=20 x 10(9)/l 13 days (range 13-27) </plain></SENT>
