<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 25 patients with SAA received enhanced, intensive, immuno-suppressive therapy and a cord blood transfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therapy protocol: Anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) 2.5 mg/(kg•d) × 5d; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">Cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> 50 mg/(kg•d) × 2d; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> (CsA) maintenance therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULT: 25 patients were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>18 underwent a complete recovery, 4 made significant improvements, 1 did not respond, and 2 died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the efficacy rate was 88% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median follow-up time was 35 months (range 13-47 months), and the 3-year overall survival rate was 92% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients rapidly achieved reconstitution of hematopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median time to neutrophil ANC &gt; 0.5 × 109/L was 18 days (range 8-36), platelets &gt;20 × 109/L was 34 days (range 12-123), and Hb &gt; 100 g/L 95 days (range 35-173) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Enhanced, intensive, immuno-suppressive therapy with umbilical cord blood support may be an effective option for SAA therapy </plain></SENT>
