<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study describes the proportion of patients transfused, units of blood transfused and trigger-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (Hb) levels for transfusions in severe anemic, ND-CKD patients in routine practice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of electronic medical record data from the Henry Ford Health System identified 374 adult, ND-CKD patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (Hb &lt; 10 g/dL and subsequent use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents [ESA] therapy, blood transfusions, or a second Hb &lt; 10 g/dL) between January 2004 and June 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Exclusions included those with prior diagnoses of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740457" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer, renal</z:e> or liver transplant, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>end-stage renal disease</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, trauma, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sickle cell disease</z:e>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A gap of ≥ 1 days between units of blood transfused was counted as a separate transfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At least 1 transfusion (mean of 2 units; range, 1-4) was administered to 20% (75/374) of ND-CKD patients with mean (± SD) follow-up of 459 (± 427) days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean (± SD) Hb level closest and prior to a transfusion was 8.8 (± 1.5) g/dL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients who were hospitalized in the 6 months prior to their first <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> diagnosis were 6.3 times more likely to receive a blood transfusion than patients who were not hospitalized (p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004950'>peripheral vascular disease</z:hpo> (PVD) were twice as likely to have a transfusion as patients without PVD (p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Transfusions were prevalent and the trigger <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> concentration was approximately 9 g/dL among ND-CKD patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>To reduce the transfusion burden, clinicians should consider other <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> treatments including ESA therapy </plain></SENT>
