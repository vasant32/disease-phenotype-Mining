<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>T1-weighted coronal images (TR600/TE40) of the pelvis and proximal femurs demonstrated marrow pathology in adult patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A simple <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> grading system was developed to classify patterns of marrow involvement, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> grading of cellularity was correlated with marrow histology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> marrow produced a relatively high signal intensity reflecting the predominance of short T1 fat in the marrow space </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>Aplastic anemia</z:hpo> could not be differentiated from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> with the pulse sequences employed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Marrow involvement by Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> was detected as diffuse marrow infiltration with superimposed focal areas of even lower signal intensity, reflecting the nodular nature of Hodgkin's </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that infiltrative marrow disorders can be sensitively detected by MRI </plain></SENT>
