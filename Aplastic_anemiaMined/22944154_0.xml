<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To explore the regulative factors on CD8(+)HLA-DR(+) T cells in the patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (SAA) and examine the roles of these cells in the immunopathogenesis of SAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: CD8(+)HLA-DR(+) T cells were sorted from bone marrow mononuclear cells of 13 SAA patients from July 2011 to March 2012 by magnetic activated cell sorting system and were divided into 3 groups: interleukin 2 (IL-2) group (0, 0.1, 1, 10, 100 and 1000 U/ml), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> A (CsA) group (addition of 400 ng/ml CsA in each IL-2-containing well),receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> group (addition of IL-2 receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> 8 µg/ml in each IL-2-containing well) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Then cell proliferation rate was evaluated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> assay after a 72-hour culturing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow mononuclear cells of the SAA patients were divided into CsA group, IL-2 group and control group and cultured for 18 hours and another 4 hours following the dosing of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37532">phorbol ester</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor β (TNF-β) in CD8(+)HLA-DR(+) T cells was analyzed by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The cell proliferations of IL-2 wells at the concentrations of 10, 100 and 1000 U/L (0.36 ± 0.12, 0.41 ± 0.12, 0.46 ± 0.14) were significantly higher than those of the control wells (0.23 ± 0.11), CsA group (0.18 ± 0.05, 0.19 ± 0.00, 0.20 ± 0.04) and receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> group (0.18 ± 0.05, 0.17 ± 0.04, 0.18 ± 0.03, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No statistic difference existed between CsA and receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> groups (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The expressions of TNF-β of CD8(+)HLA-DR(+)T cells of the IL-2 group were higher than those of the control group (64% ± 25% vs 46% ± 22%) whereas the CsA group (27% ± 20%) were lower than those of the control group (both P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: IL-2 can significantly stimulate the proliferation of CD8(+)HLA-DR(+) T cells and accelerate the in vitro secretion of TNF-β in SAA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The proliferation may be inhibited by CsA and receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>And the expression of TNF-β is suppressed significantly by CsA </plain></SENT>
