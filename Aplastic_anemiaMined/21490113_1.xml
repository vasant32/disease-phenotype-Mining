<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Exposure data were obtained via participants' self-reports and by experts' assessments and the data from these 2 exposure assessment methods were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There was an increased risk of AA associated with several classes of pesticides measured by either self-report or expert assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The strongest associations were seen in those whose exposures were identified both by self-report and by expert assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Comparing very high/high to no exposure, odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) were as follows: for organophosphates 3.20 (1.87-5.46), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23003">carbamates</z:chebi> 4.75 (1.92-11.75), organochlorines 6.04 (1.31-27.84), and <z:chebi fb="11" ids="34905">paraquat</z:chebi> 2.17 (1.11-4.25) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were correlations among the pesticides because many types were used in the same job, so it was not possible to determine whether these risks were independent or because of confounding of one by another </plain></SENT>
