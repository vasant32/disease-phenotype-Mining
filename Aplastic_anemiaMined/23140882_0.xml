<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the severity of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e> and the success of iron chelation therapy in patients with cartilage-hair <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHH</z:e>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001908'>hypoplastic anemia</z:hpo>, with particular focus on adverse effects of iron <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38161">chelators</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Four of the 23 presently surviving Finnish patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHH</z:e> under 18 years of age are dependent on regular red blood cell transfusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Their hospital records were reviewed for history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> and chelation therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cumulative iron load from transfusions was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Efficacy of the chelation therapy was evaluated biochemically and by liver iron content assessments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At the introduction of iron chelation, the patients had received on average 99 (37-151) transfusions; the mean cumulative <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e> was 4640 (800-8200) mg, the annual iron accumulation rate 0.35 (0.25-0.41) mg/kg/d, and the mean plasma ferritin was 2896 (1217-6240) Î¼g/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Liver iron content, determined by biopsy in 3 patients, was on average 20.0 (6.6-30.0) mg/g liver dry weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients, except 1 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002251'>Hirschsprung disease</z:hpo>, tolerated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">deferoxamine</z:chebi>, deferiprone, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49005">deferasirox</z:chebi> therapy well, showing only mild adverse effects typical for the agents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Plasma ferritin levels and liver magnetic resonance imaging T2* of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e> showed successful chelation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Iron chelation is well tolerated in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHH</z:e>, with possible exception of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002251'>Hirschsprung disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Successful chelation will prepare for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CHH</z:e> with persistent transfusion dependency </plain></SENT>
