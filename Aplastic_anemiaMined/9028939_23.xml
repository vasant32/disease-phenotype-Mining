<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>LTC-IC numbers were extrapolated from secondary CFC numbers after 5 weeks of culture, and clonogenicity of LTC-ICs was determined by limiting dilution assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteers (n = 13), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> patients (n = 14) showed a 4.7-fold decrease in CD34+ cells and an 8.2-fold decrease in CFCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>LTC-ICs in BM and in PB were decreased 7.3-fold and 50-fold, respectively </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>To directly measure the colony-forming ability of GPI-anchored protein-deficient CD34+ cells, we separated CD34+ cells from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> patients for the GPI+ and GPI-phenotype; CD59 expression was chosen as a marker of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> phenotype based on high and homogeneous expression on fluorescent staining </plain></SENT>
