<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Observational study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: The Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi, from January 1999 till December 2008 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY: Medical records of children aged less than 15 years of age diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinicohaematological features, treatment and its response to therapy and outcome were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Results were described in percentages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ninety patients were diagnosed to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA); 65 were male during the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Age ranged from 1 to 15 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>Fever</z:hpo> in 65 patients (72.2%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000980'>pallor</z:hpo> in 53 (58.8%), skin <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> in 49 (54.4%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000421'>epistaxis</z:hpo> in 31(34.4%) were the most common and frequent presenting features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Congenital (Fanconi's) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> was found in 15 (16.6%) and acquired idiopathic in 75 (83.4%) of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Very severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (VSAA) was seen in 29 (32.2%), 26 (28.9%) had severe AA and 17 (18.9%) had moderate AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Eight patients (8.9%) underwent haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), 12 (13.3%) received immunosuppressive therapy (IST) and 70 patients (77.7%) received other and supportive therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Five (62.5%) patients showed complete response to HSCT and 3 (37.5%) failed to engraft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>IST showed complete response in 3 (25%), partial response in 5 (41.6%) and no response in 4 (33.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Twenty two patients (24.4%) expired either due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> in 16 (72.7%, fungal in 6, <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> in 10) and intracranial haemorrhage in 6 (27.3%) cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Majority of cases with AA were acquired and idiopathic in etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>VSAA and SAA were frequent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Response to HSCT and IST was sub-optimal </plain></SENT>
