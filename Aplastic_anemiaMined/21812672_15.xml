<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: In severe acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, hematopoietic failure is the result of immune-mediated destruction of bone marrow stem and progenitor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Immunosuppressive therapy with antithymocyte globulin (ATG) plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> is an effective alternative to stem-cell transplantation and improves blood counts and survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although horse ATG is the standard therapy, rabbit ATG is more potent in depleting peripheral-blood lymphocytes and is preferred in other clinical circumstances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: From December 2005 through July 2010, we performed a randomized trial comparing these two ATG formulations in conventional regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were treated at a single facility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The primary outcome was hematologic response at 6 months, as determined by blood counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The study was designed to enroll 60 patients each for the rabbit-ATG and horse-ATG groups and was powered to detect a difference of 25 percentage points in the response rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A large, unexpected difference was observed in the rate of hematologic response at 6 months in favor of horse ATG (68%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 56 to 80) as compared with rabbit ATG (37%; 95% CI, 24 to 49; P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Overall survival at 3 years also differed, with a survival rate of 96% (95% CI, 90 to 100) in the horse-ATG group as compared with 76% (95% CI, 61 to 95) in the rabbit-ATG group (P=0.04) when data were censored at the time of stem-cell transplantation, and 94% (95% CI, 88 to 100) as compared with 70% (95% CI, 56 to 86; P=0.008) in the respective groups when stem-cell-transplantation events were not censored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In a randomized study, rabbit ATG was inferior to horse ATG as a first treatment for severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, as indicated by hematologic response and survival </plain></SENT>
