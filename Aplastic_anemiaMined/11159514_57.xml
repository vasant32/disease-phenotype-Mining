<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To study the turnover of stem cells in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> syndromes, the telomere length in peripheral blood granulocytes and lymphocytes from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA, n = 56) and hemolytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0004818'>paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</z:hpo> (n = 6) was analyzed relative to age-matched controls by means of fluorescence in situ hybridization and flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The telomere lengths in granulocytes from patients with AA were found to be significantly shorter than those in age-adjusted controls (P =.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, surprisingly, telomere length in granulocytes from AA patients who had recovered after immunosuppressive therapy did not differ significantly from controls, whereas untreated patients and nonresponders with persistent severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> showed marked and significant telomere shortening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These results support extensive proliferation of hematopoietic stem cells in subgroups of AA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Because <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals show significant variation in telomere length, individual measurements in blood cells from AA patients may be of limited value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Whether sequential telomere length measurements can be used as a prognostic tool in this group of disorders remains to be clarified </plain></SENT>
