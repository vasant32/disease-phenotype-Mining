<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Consequently, the establishment of a sustained chimerism may allow long-term acceptance of transplanted organs without immunosuppression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report a girl with refractory severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> who developed low recipient level hematopoietic chimerism following transplantation of maternal highly purified CD34+ cells without prophylactic immunosuppression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Renal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034155" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombotic microangiopathy</z:e> led to <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>chronic renal failure</z:hpo> and she received skin allografts from her mother in view of a future kidney donation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The maternal skin grafts were accepted without immunosuppression and the hematopoietic chimerism remained stable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Skin transplantation may be a helpful and easily applicable tool to monitor donor-related tolerance in hematopoietic chimerism clinically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It should contribute to minimize the risks of subsequent solid organ transplantation from the same donor without immunosuppression </plain></SENT>
