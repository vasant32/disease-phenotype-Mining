<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two siblings were full mismatches with the recipient and an unrelated search initiated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patient was treated with Fludaribine and Rituxan complicated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004610" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bacteremia</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Prior to transplant, confirmatory typing performed on PB revealed two full haplotypes at Class I and II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sample identification error and the presence of third party lymphocyte engraftment as a result of prior red cell or granulocyte transfusion(s) were ruled out by STR analysis of 8 loci of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> samples, T and B cells from cryopreserved PB at <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005699" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">blast crisis</z:e> were HLA typed independently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>T cell typing yielded both complete haplotypes (genotype verified by offspring HLA typing); B cells typed for homozygous haplotype indicating loss of heterozygosity of MHC locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Microarray based comparative genomic hybridization of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cells confirmed LOH at 6p </plain></SENT>
