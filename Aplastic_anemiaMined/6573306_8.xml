<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The elder child presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and was being considered for bone marrow transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The younger child was healthy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The inability to phenotype both children for these three gene products persisted throughout the 21-month period of observation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The DR antigens were demonstrable which rendered it possible to deduce their A, B, and C genotype from the typing of the other four family members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although alloantisera failed to detect the antigens on peripheral blood lymphocytes, monoclonal antibodies demonstrated reduced amounts of the HLA-A,B, and C antigens on the cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The reduced level was confirmed following EBV transformation of the cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After prolonged culture, HLA antigens immunoprecipitated from the cell extracts were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in amount, molecular weight, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="15841">polypeptide</z:chebi> composition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Southern blot analysis did not reveal gross genomic rearrangements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A regulatory defect leading to the expression of these Class I antigens is postulated </plain></SENT>
