<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have assessed in a phase I/II clinical study the tolerability and efficacy of long-term application of recombinant human interleukin-3 (rh-IL-3) in combination with antithymocyte globulin (ATG) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> (CSA) in 13 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> who were refractory to or relapsed after previous immunosuppressive treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Four cohorts of three patients were consecutively enrolled so that they received rh-IL-3 on days 9, 6, 3 and 1 after start of ATG/CSA treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Yeast-derived recombinant human IL-3 was administered by daily subcutaneous injection until day 90 at a dosage of 250 micrograms/m2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Long-term application of rh-IL-3 was well tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The combination of rh-IL-3 with immunosuppression did not modify the known toxicities of ATG and CSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Incidence and severity of rh-IL-3-related adverse events was less than in other phase I/II trials of rh-IL-3 as single-agent therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One might speculate that co-medication with CSA alleviates rh-IL-3-induced side effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three of eight patients with refractory AA and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four patients with relapsed AA responded to the combined treatment within four months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median time to response was 91.5 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was evidence for an rh-IL-3-dependent response in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Long-term rh-IL-3 did not cause stem cell exhaustion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One patient died early during the course of the study from EBV-driven <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024314" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphoproliferative disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Two patients developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> 4 and 22 months after cessation of rh-IL-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, long-term rh-IL-3 in combination with immunosuppression is well tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The response rate to the combined treatment in refractory and relapsed AA was high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Recombinant human IL-3-dependent responses suggest efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>A prospective randomized trial comparing immunosuppression alone versus a combination with rh-IL-3 is warranted </plain></SENT>
