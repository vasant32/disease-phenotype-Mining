<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Manifestations of telomere disease include the <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> syndromes <z:mp ids='MP_0009563'>dyskeratosis</z:mp> congenita and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo>, liver <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002206'>pulmonary fibrosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we describe a mutation in the CCAAT box (GCAAT) of the TERC gene promoter in a family in which multiple members had typical features of telomeropathy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The genetic alteration in this critical regulatory sequence resulted in reduced reporter gene activity and absent binding of transcription factor NF-Y, likely responsible for reduced TERC levels, decreased telomerase activity, and short telomeres </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This is the first description of a pathogenic mutation in the highly conserved CCAAT box and the first instance of a mutation in the promoter region of TERC producing a telomeropathy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We propose that current mutation-screening strategies should include gene promoter regions for the diagnosis of telomere diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This clinical trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT00071045 </plain></SENT>
