<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Balb/c mice model of immune-mediated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> was established by radiation with sublethal dose of 60Co following the intravenously infusing lymphocytes of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi>/2 mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Model mice in the treated groups were treated separately with high, middle and low dose of PNS, 3.2 mg, 1.6 mg and 0.8 mg per day respectively by intraperitoneal injection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Model mice in the control group and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mice in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control group were treated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> saline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The peripheral white blood cell (WBC) count and pathological examination of bone marrow were carried out 12 days later, the bone marrow was taken to be incubated in semi-solid culture system for observing proliferation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HPC</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: PNS could (1) increase peripheral WBC count: as compared with that in the model control, WBC in the high, middle and low dose PNS groups was raised by (34.3 +/- 2.9)%, (29.2 +/- 1.7)% and (14.5 +/- 1.6)% respectively, P &lt; 0.01 and P &lt; 0.05; (2) improve the bone marrow inhibition: pathological examination showed in the model group, the hematopoietic structure was destroyed and replaced by fatty tissue, while in the PNS treated groups, the structure of marrow was rather complete and filled with abundant hematopoietic cells; (3) promote the proliferation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HPC</z:e>: as compared with the model group, the colony formation of CFU-GM were increased by (64.4 +/- 2.8)%, (67.3 +/- 2.4)% and (21.9 +/- 1.8)% respectively and that of CFU-E increased by (31.9 +/- 3.6)%, (20.7 +/- 2.4)% and (12.8 +/- 2.6)% respectively in the three PNS treated group (P &lt; 0.01 and P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: PNS could enhance hematopoiesis by promoting proliferation of CFU-GM and CFU-E progenitors so as to improve the hematopoietic function in mice of immune-mediated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
