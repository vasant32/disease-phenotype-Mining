<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, no comparative studies have yet been conducted to examine the efficacy of FK/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> (MTX) and CsA/MTX in patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (SAA) given unrelated donor bone marrow transplantation (U-BMT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used matched-pair analysis to compare FK/MTX with CsA/MTX in patients with SAA who received U-BMT through the Japan Marrow Donor Program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Forty-seven pairs could be matched exactly for recipient age and conditioning regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Forty-five patients achieved engraftment in the FK group and 42 patients in the CsA group </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The study shows the superiority of FK/MTX over CsA/MTX in overall survival because of the lower incidence of transplantation-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
