<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four patients were initially entered; 21 now may be evaluated: seven with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, six with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011974'>myelofibrosis</z:hpo>, and eight with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Six patients improved, but only three were taking <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7466">nandrolone</z:chebi>, the other three placebo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Response did not correlate with type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No serious drug toxicity was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011974'>myelofibrosis</z:hpo> improved dramatically with placebo therapy alone, no longer requiring frequent transfusions because of a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> level increase from 5.4 to 15.8 gm/100 ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that no substantial improvement of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> due to marrow failure can be ascribed to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7466">nandrolone</z:chebi> as given, and that clinical trials in these conditions should be controlled to exclude spontaneous remissions as a cause of apparent improvement </plain></SENT>
