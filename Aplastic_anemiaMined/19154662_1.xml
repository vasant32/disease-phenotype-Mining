<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have studied the expression of these two molecules in red blood cells, granulocytes and platelets in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> (two patients), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001890'>autoimmune hemolytic anemia</z:hpo> (AIHA) (seven patients), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001973'>autoimmune thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> (ATP) (22 patients), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (SLE) (19 patients), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) (eight patients), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272126" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Evans syndrome</z:e> (ES) (two patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A diminished expression of CD55 and CD59 was found in the three cell lines of the two patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the seven patients with AIHA two were found with CD59 diminished expression in red blood cells and one with CD59 diminished expression in granulocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the patients with ATP one was found with CD55 diminished expression in red blood cells, one with CD59 diminished expression granulocytes and one with a CD59 diminished expression in the platelets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the subset of patients with SLE only one was found with a CD55 diminished expression in the red blood cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the patients with AA, a diminished expression in red blood cells was not found; however, one patient was found with a diminished expression of CD59 in granulocytes, and one patient with a diminished expression of CD55 in the platelets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the two patients with ES we did not found changes in the expression of CD55 and CD59 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the diminished expression of the glycolsylphosphatidylinositol-anchored type I cell surface proteins CD55 and CD59 is not specific to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> and that it can be found in patients with a variety of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disorders</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
