<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The pathophysiology is immune mediated in most cases, activated T1 lymphocytes have been identified as effector cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The disease can be successfully treated with combined immunosuppressive therapy or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>Hepatitis</z:hpo>-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (HAA) is a syndrome of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> following the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> seronegative <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>HAA syndrome most often affects young males who presented severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> two to three months after an episode of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The clinical course of <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> is more frequently benign but a fulminant severe course is also described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> can be explosive and severe and it is usually fatal if untreated, no correlations have been observed between severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> and AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In none of the studies a specific virus could be identified and most cases are seronegative for known <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> viruses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The clinical characteristics and response to immunotherapy indicate a central role for immune-mediated mechanism in the pathogenesis of HAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The initial target organ of the immune response is the liver as suggested by the time interval between <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Liver histology is characterized by T cell infiltrating the parenchyma as reported in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Recently in HAA it has been demonstrated intrahepatic and blood lymphocytes with T cell repertoire similar to that of confirmed <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The expanded T cell clones return to a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> distribution after response to immunosuppressive treatment, suggesting the antigen or T cell clearance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Therapeutic options are the same as acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
