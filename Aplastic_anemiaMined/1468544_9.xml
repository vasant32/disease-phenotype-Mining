<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The inhibitor, a product of bone marrow macrophages, activated lymphocytes, and monocytes, is identical to macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP-1 alpha) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report homologous (SCI/hMIP-1 alpha) sequences in freshly isolated lymphocytes, monocytes, and granulocytes and have found that SCI <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> can be induced in monocytes by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi> (LPS) and interleukins 1, 2, and 6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) decreases the expression of SCI/hMIP-1 alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although only a low level expression of SCI/hMIP-1 alpha <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> can be detected in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human bone marrow nucleated cells (NCBM), very significant increases in the levels of SCI/hMIP-1 alpha <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> transcripts are observed in NCBM from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that the expression of SCI/hMIP-1 alpha in bone marrow may reflect dysregulated cytokine production and activation of the immune system that may possibly contribute to disease progression </plain></SENT>
