<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Significant modifications of TM-TG levels were found: a 2 to 10 fold increase of TG cells and a 2 to 10 fold decrease of TM cells from pre-transplant levels could be observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The TM-TG imbalance appeared together with the clinical signs of GVHD: the level of TM-<z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> (but not the level of TG increase) correlated with the severity of GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The TM-TG modifications were observed as long as 3 years after transplantation, also in the absence of signs of GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> six patients were found to have severely impaired pokeweed-induced B-cell differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The clinical implications and the possible lack of T-helper activity are discussed </plain></SENT>
