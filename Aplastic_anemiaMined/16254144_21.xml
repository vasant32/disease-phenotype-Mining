<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The disease occurs more frequently in Asia than in the West, with incidence rates 2- to 3-fold higher </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report updated results of an epidemiologic study conducted in Thailand from 1989 to 2002, in which 541 patients and 2261 controls were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Exposures were determined by in-person interview </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We observed significantly elevated relative risk estimates for <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> (3.5) and other solvents (2.0) and for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35358">sulfonamides</z:chebi> (5.6), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50264">thiazides</z:chebi> (3.8), and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6704">mebendazole</z:chebi> (3.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="17698">Chloramphenicol</z:chebi> use was infrequent, and no significant association was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Agricultural pesticides were implicated in Khonkaen (northeastern Thailand) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were significant associations with organophosphates (2.1), <z:chebi fb="28" ids="16130">DDT</z:chebi> (6.7), and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23003">carbamates</z:chebi> (7.4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We found significant risks for farmers exposed to ducks and geese (3.7) and a borderline association with animal fertilizer (2.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There was a significant association in Khonkaen with drinking other than bottled or distilled water (2.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Nonmedical needle exposure was associated in Bangkok and Khonkaen combined (3.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Most striking was the large etiologic fraction in a rural region accounted for by animal exposures and drinking of water from sources such as wells, rural taps, and rainwater, consistent with an infectious etiology for many cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> in Thailand </plain></SENT>
