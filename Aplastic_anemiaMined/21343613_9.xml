<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Hematopoietic stem cells (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSCs</z:chebi>) replicate (self-renew) to create 2 daughter cells with capabilities equivalent to their parent, as well as differentiate, and thus can both maintain and restore blood cell production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cell labeling with division-sensitive markers and competitive transplantation studies have been used to estimate the replication rate of murine <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSCs</z:chebi> in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, these methods are not feasible in humans and surrogate assays are required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this report, we analyze the changing ratio with age of maternal/paternal X-chromosome phenotypes in blood cells from females and infer that human <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSCs</z:chebi> replicate on average once every 40 weeks (range, 25-50 weeks) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We then confirm this estimate with 2 independent approaches, use the estimate to simulate human hematopoiesis, and show that the simulations accurately reproduce marrow transplantation data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our simulations also provide evidence that the number of human <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSCs</z:chebi> increases from birth until adolescence and then plateaus, and that the ratio of contributing to quiescent <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSCs</z:chebi> in humans significantly differs from mouse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, they suggest that human marrow failure, such as the marrow failure that occurs after umbilical cord blood transplantation and with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, results from insufficient numbers of early progenitor cells, and not the absence of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSCs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
