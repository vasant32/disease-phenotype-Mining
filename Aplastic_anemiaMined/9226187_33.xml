<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Transplant regimens, supportive care, and patient selection have changed substantially since then </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our objective was to determine the impact of these changes on transplant outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We studied 1,305 recipients of HLA-identical sibling transplants for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> between 1976 and 1992, reported to the IBMTR by 179 centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We compared survival of transplants performed in three intervals (1976 through 1980 [n = 186], 1981 through 1987 [n = 648], and 1988 through 1992 [n = 471]) using Cox proportional hazards regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five-year survival (+/-95% confidence interval) increased from 48% +/- 7% in the 1976-1980 cohort to 66% +/- 6% in the 1988-1992 cohort (P &lt; .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Risks of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) and interstitial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> decreased over time, but the risk of graft failure did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Higher long-term survival resulted primarily from decreased mortality in the first 3 months posttransplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Late mortality risks were low and changed little over the intervals studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, changes in transplantation strategies accounted for most but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the improved outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> to prevent GVHD was the most important factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Changes in patient selection did not seem to explain improved survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Survival after HLA-identical sibling bone marrow transplantations for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> has improved since 1976 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Changes in GVHD prophylaxis account for much of this improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Other changes may also operate </plain></SENT>
