<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The main indications were ALL (n = 39), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (n = 132), <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> (n = 75) and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (n = 26) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Now the transplantation rate is one bmt per week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Early transplantation during a controlled stage of disease provides the best chance of cure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Important prerequisites of a successful allotransplantation are patient age under 45-50 years, good general condition and a histocompatible donor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In case of autologous bmt, being mainly tested in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemias</z:hpo> and malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, the age limit is 50-55 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>If the allogeneic transplantation is performed during an early stage of disease, the cure expectancy is about 50% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> in first remission and <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the case of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> the cure rates are even higher, provided that the transplant is grafted before multiple blood transfusions have been given </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> the risk of relapse after autologous bmt is higher than after allogeneic transplantation, but the preliminary data are promising </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The question of whether or not autologous bmt is superior to conventional chemotherapy of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, has to be investigated </plain></SENT>
