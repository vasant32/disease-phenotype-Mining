<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6504">lithium carbonate</z:chebi> led to a significant increase in the total leukocyte and neutrophil counts in patients with LGM, malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> and MM but not in patients with HA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The rise of the neutrophil count detected before (after 3 days) suggests that <z:chebi fb="32" ids="30145">lithium</z:chebi> may exert a direct stimulant action on relatively mature myeloid cells (promyelocytes and even myelocytes) but not on the undifferentiated colony-forming cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The exponential dependence was found between an increase in the neutrophil count and duration of <z:chebi fb="32" ids="30145">lithium</z:chebi> intake, which permits forecasting the expected rise in the counts of these cells </plain></SENT>
