<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 43-year-old woman with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (SAA) received anti-thymocyte globulin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> (CyA) and achieved hematological remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although she had maintained hematological remission, the disease relapsed 10 months after arbitrary discontinuance of maintenance therapy with CyA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Resumption of CyA therapy was not effective, and her condition became complicated with progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0000246'>sinusitis</z:hpo> with bone destruction, which was refractory to antibiotics, antifungal agents, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, and surgical drainage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Because of the necessity for early neutrophil recovery (to resolve the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>), we proceeded with a combination therapy using allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) promptly followed by granulocyte transfusion (GTX) from the same human leukocyte antigen-identical donor rather than carrying out a second immunosuppressive therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient showed temporal resolution of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> on the second day after a single GTX </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although the patient had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> on day 11, it was resolved promptly after engraftment on day 16 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This report suggests the clinical utility of a salvage therapy with allogeneic PBSCT followed by GTX in a particular case of recurrent SAA with refractory <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> </plain></SENT>
