<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this case, the mean bone marrow cellularity and absolute numbers of erythroids and megakaryocytes were continuously higher than those in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects for 3 weeks after the appearance of peripheral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During this stage, administration of recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) improved marrow myeloid <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>peripheral neutropenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During the period in which the marrow cellularity transformed from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath>, the bone marrow showed a mixture of hyper-, normo- and hypocellular portions, and the decrease in the megakaryocytes was the faster than myeloid and erythroid cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that (1) ineffective hematopoiesis might be present in the early stage of the disease, (2) G-CSF responsive granulocytic precursors remained during the early stage of the disease, and (3) the marrow <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> progressed in the manner of aplastic nest formation during the period in which the marrow cellularity declined to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We experienced another case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> showing the same progress of bone marrow findings and speculated that this might be one of the ways of the progression of bone marrow hypoplastic formation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
