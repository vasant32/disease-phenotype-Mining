<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Although there are anecdotal reports of the efficacy of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="4315">danazol</z:chebi> in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA), there has been no systematic study to clarify its efficacy and toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we assessed the efficacy of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="4315">danazol</z:chebi> for treatment of patients with AA refractory to immunosuppressive therapy (IST) and those who relapsed after IST, in a prospective clinical trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sixteen patients (12 males and four females; six severe cases and 10 moderate cases) were treated with 300 mg of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="4315">danazol</z:chebi> daily for 12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients completed the treatment period without occurrence of severe toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three female patients achieved partial remission, whereas only two of the 12 male patients did so </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>None of the responders had shown a response to previous IST or an increase in the percentage of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004818'>paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>)-type cells which are known to be a marker for a good response to IST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="4315">danazol</z:chebi> is effective for a subset of AA patients, and particularly for female patients with AA refractory to IST </plain></SENT>
