<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we compared the basic properties of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), a major component of bone marrow microenvironment, from five SAA children with those of MSCs from five controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although MSCs from SAA children and controls were similar in <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and immunophenotypic profile, SAA MSCs had slower expansion rate and smaller cumulative population doubling (1.83 +/- 1.21 vs 3.36 +/- 0.87; p = 0.046), indicating lower proliferative capacity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After osteogenic induction, SAA MSCs showed lower alkaline phosphatase activity (optical density, 1.46 +/- 0.04 vs 2.27 +/- 0.32; p = 0.013), less intense von Kossa staining, and lower gene expression of core binding factor alpha1 (0.0015 +/- 0.0005 vs 0.0056 +/- 0.0017; p = 0.013) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Following adipogenic induction, SAA MSCs showed less intense Oil red O staining (optical density, 0.86 +/- 0.22 vs 1.73 +/- 0.42; p = 0.013) and lower <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi> lipase expression (0.0105 +/- 0.0074 vs 0.0527 +/- 0.0254; p = 0.013) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings provided evidence that defects in bone marrow MSCs of SAA children do exist </plain></SENT>
