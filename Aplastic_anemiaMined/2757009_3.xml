<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Relationships between organomegaly, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011974'>myelofibrosis</z:hpo>, and extramedullary erythropoiesis, as well as differences among clinical disorders, are discussed </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that splenic erythropoiesis 1) is encountered in a variety of clinical conditions; 2) is not necessarily associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001744'>splenomegaly</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011974'>myelofibrosis</z:hpo>, even in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorders</z:hpo>; 3) is part of a predominantly extramedullary (in the liver as well as in the spleen), expanded, and largely inefficient total erythropoiesis; and 4) can be evaluated in a semiquantitative manner by surface counting </plain></SENT>
