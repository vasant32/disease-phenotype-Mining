<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A retrospective multicenter study was performed to assess the clinical results in patients with acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) allografted over a 19 year period and to identify prognostic factors influencing survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>From April 1978 to December 1997, 176 patients were transplanted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Records from 160 receiving related matched bone marrow transplantation (BMT) were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifty-two percent of the patients were older than 20 years, 5% older than 40; 6.3% were untransfused at BMT and 56.2% had received prior treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Conditioning regimens were with chemotherapy in 43.7% of the procedures and with additional irradiation in 56.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">Graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) prophylaxis was based on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> (CsA) in 58.1% of the patients while <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> (MTX) was administered to 41.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Transplantation earlier on, a longer interval from diagnosis to BMT, GVHD prophylaxis with MTX, graft failure/rejection and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> severe GVHD were adverse factors for survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The use of CsA emerged as the main factor for the improvement, inducing a significant decrease in graft failure/rejection rate and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD when compared with MTX alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Radiation-containing regimens decreased the graft failure/rejection rate without improving survival due to the increased risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Age and number of transfusions pretransplant did not influence outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Survival achieved since 1991 is 79.79%, and graft failure and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> severe GVHD rates are 6.0% and 11.8%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, CsA-based post-graft immunosuppression has been crucial in achieving improved survival in patients with acquired AA up to 40 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Regardless of CsA use, further improvement in survival was apparent with time, probably due to better skills in patient care </plain></SENT>
