<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Six patients were included: 3 cases with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> in first complete remission (2 AML and 1 ALL), 2 severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemias</z:hpo> and 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the 6 cases were received HLA-identical siblings donor peripheral blood stem cell transplantation after a nonmyeloablative conditioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The donor cells were engrafted in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients (3 cases were full engrafment of donor cells and 3 were mixed chimerism) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hematopoietic recovery was appeared in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the cases (ANC recovered to more than 0.5 x 10(9)/L and platelet count to more than 30 x 10(9)/L on day 9 to day 21 and day 14 to day 28 after transplantation, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two patients developed III or IV degree GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our preliminary results suggest that the procedure is more safe, efficient and less complications than myeloablative conditioning regimens and represents another new approach in the management of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
