<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>There is some clinical evidence that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> A (CyA) is associated with thrombotic complications of bone marrow and renal transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated plasma concentrations of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi>(a) [Lp(a)], a potentially atherothrombotic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="6495">lipoprotein</z:chebi>, and hemostatic and vascular status in ten patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> receiving CyA, eleven patients not taking it, and 38 age-matched healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients receiving CyA had significantly higher concentrations of plasma fibrinogen (P &lt; 0.05), prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 (F1 + 2; P &lt; 0.05), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1; P &lt; 0.05), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">von Willebrand</z:e> factor antigen (P &lt; 0.05) than did patients not taking CyA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Plasma concentrations of Lp(a) were higher in CyA-treated patients than those not receiving it (P &lt; 0.05) or healthy controls (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The difference in the Lp(a) concentration between controls and patients who did not receive CyA-treatment was not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that <z:hpo ids='HP_0100724'>hypercoagulability</z:hpo> is likely to occur during CyA therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further, the presence of high concentrations of Lp(a) may accelerate the process of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> and increase thrombotic events in patients receiving long-term CyA </plain></SENT>
