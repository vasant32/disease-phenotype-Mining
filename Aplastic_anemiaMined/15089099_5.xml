<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Remoxipride is an atypical antipsychotic displaying selective binding to the <z:chebi fb="40" ids="18243">dopamine</z:chebi> D2 receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> led to the withdrawal of remoxipride from the market in December 1993 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The remoxipride metabolite NCQ-344 is a <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17594">hydroquinone</z:chebi> while the structural isomer NCQ-436 is a <z:chebi fb="5" ids="18135">catechol</z:chebi>, both of which have been suggested to be capable of forming a reactive para- and ortho-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="36141">quinone</z:chebi>, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recently, these two remoxipride metabolites were shown to induce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in human bone marrow progenitor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, NCQ-344 also caused <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> of these cells unlike NCQ-436 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although NCQ-344 has been detected in plasma of humans dosed with remoxipride, to date, no experimental evidence for the formation of the corresponding para-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="36141">quinone</z:chebi> has been obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Here, we report the detection of three <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> (GSH) conjugates of NCQ-344 in vitro that were formed following a chemical reaction and characterized by tandem mass spectrometry and for a cyclized conjugate additionally with derivatization and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="29237">deuterium</z:chebi> exchange </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, NCQ-436 did not form a GSH conjugate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="24757">Hypochlorous acid</z:chebi> oxidized NCQ-344 to the para-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="36141">quinone</z:chebi> while NCQ-436 was resistant to oxidation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Upon incubation with NCQ-344, stimulated human neutrophils produced from 2- to 5-fold greater amounts of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> conjugates than unstimulated neutrophils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Ab initio calculations on these remoxipride metabolites indicated that the reaction leading to the respective <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36141">quinone</z:chebi> was spontaneous for the para-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="36141">quinone</z:chebi> (e.g., from NCQ-344) while ortho-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="36141">quinone</z:chebi> (e.g., from NCQ-436) formation was not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that NCQ-344 is capable of facile formation of a reactive para-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="36141">quinone</z:chebi> capable of reacting with GSH and may rationalize previous findings regarding the biological effects observed in vitro with these two remoxipride metabolites </plain></SENT>
