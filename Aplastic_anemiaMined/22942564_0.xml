<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Five patients who had undergone six transplants were included in the study and received a total of 38 (3-13) granulocyte transfusions during these six transplants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median granulocyte concentration was 3.4 × 10(11) per apheresis bag </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Full clinical and radiological recovery was achieved in three of the five high risk patients with active invasive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026946" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fungal infection</z:e> with the combination of antifungal agents and GTX </plain></SENT>
