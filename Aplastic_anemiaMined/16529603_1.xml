<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0004818'>Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>) is characterized by the clonal expansion of blood cells, which are deficient in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24410">glycosylphosphatidylinositol</z:chebi> anchored proteins (GPI-APs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> frequently occurs during the clinical course of acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA), it is likely that a process inducing <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> in AA is responsible for the selection of GPI-AP deficient blood cells or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> clone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To explore the nature and mutation of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> clone in AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We performed regular repeated flow cytometric analyses of CD59 expression on peripheral blood cells from a cohort of 32 patients with AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mutation of phosphatidylinositol glycan class A (PIG-A) was also studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Fifty-one episodes of occurrences of CD59 negative granulocytes out of a total cohort 167 flow cytometric analyses (31%) were observed in 22 patients (69%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CD59 negative erythrocytes were less apparent than the granulocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Repeated occurrences of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> clones were observed in 16 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Most of the emerging <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> clones were transient in nature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>They were more frequently detected during episodes of lower white blood cell and platelet counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Persistence and expansion of the GPI-AP deficient blood cell populations to the level of clinical <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> were seen in only four patients (12.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Analysis of PIG-A gene demonstrated eight mutations among the four patients, with two and four independent mutations in two patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates that PIG-A mutations of hematopoietic stem cells with resultant <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> clones, are relatively common among AA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>It also supports the hypothesis of selection of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> clone by a process or condition associated with or responsible for <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> in AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>However, there must be an additional factor favoring expansion or growth of the clone to the level of clinical or florid <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
