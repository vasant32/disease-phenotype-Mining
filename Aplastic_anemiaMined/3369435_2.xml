<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Four <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17698">chloramphenicol</z:chebi> (CAP) metabolites known to be produced by intestinal bacteria were examined with respect to their capacity to induce DNA damage in intact cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The induction of DNA single-strand breaks in Raji cells, activated human lymphocytes, and human marrow cells was assayed by the alkaline elution technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One of the four compounds tested, dehydro-CAP, was capable of inducing DNA single-strand breaks in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three cell systems at concentrations of 10(-4) M </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This effect is comparable to that observed previously with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35801">nitroso</z:chebi>-CAP, the nitroreduction intermediate of CAP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The nitroreduction of dehydro-CAP by human bone marrow cell homogenate was detected by the production of the corresponding amino derivative amounting to 5.6 X 10(-5) M from 2 X 10(-3) M substrate under aerobic conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In sharp contrast, nitroreduction of CAP by bone marrow could not be demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The genotoxicity of dehydro-CAP, its relative stability compared to the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35801">nitroso</z:chebi>-CAP, and its nitroreducibility by bone marrow suggest that this <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> metabolite of CAP may play a key role as a mediator of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> in the predisposed host </plain></SENT>
