<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The cause is unknown, and the condition is fatal without bone marrow recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Treatment includes immunosuppression regimens or bone marrow transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to investigate the incidence, cause, treatment, and outcomes of this disorder in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Retrospective chart review of 75 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006554'>acute liver failure</z:hpo> in a major pediatric liver center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eight patients had evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of those, six had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, and two had transient bone marrow suppression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were five boys, median age 57 months (range, 36-132 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two had parvovirus B19, six had non-A, non-B, non-C <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Five underwent liver transplantation: auxiliary in one, orthotopic in four </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The interval between initial symptoms and development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and/or bone marrow suppression was 21 to 99 days (median, 39 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Four patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> received intravenous antithymocyte globulin (ATG) or antilymphocyte globulin (ALG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Median recovery period of granulopoiesis was 62 days (range, 27-115 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Two made a full recovery, one had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo>, and one with unresponsive disease died of septic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Four did not receive ATG/ALG, two had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, and two had bone marrow suppression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Three underwent liver transplantation, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> four resumed granulopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>One child who underwent liver transplantation died of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> rejection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Median recovery of granulopoiesis was 99 days (range, 20-153 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>Bone marrow failure</z:hpo> occurs in 10.7% of children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006554'>acute liver failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>It sometimes occurs in association with non-A, non-B, non-C <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">parvovirus B19 infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Treatment with ATG/ALG is successful and is well tolerated in most cases </plain></SENT>
