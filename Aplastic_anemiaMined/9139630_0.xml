<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In comparable cases in human medicine an immunogenic etiology is presumed, and a treatment with the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressant</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">Cyclosporin A</z:chebi> is initiated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There are no experiences with this kind of therapy in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> of the dog </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four dogs, three with a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> of the erythropoietic cell line and one with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0235583" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">panmyelophthisis</z:e>, were treated orally for a period of several months with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">Cyclosporin A</z:chebi> 5-10 mg/kg bodyweight bid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients the plasma concentration of Cyclosporin was controlled in regular intervals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Depending on the plasma concentrations the dose was adapted in several cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cyclosporin levels between 200 and 600 ng/ml were considered desirable and their efficacy in the therapy of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> was examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0235583" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">panmyelophthisis</z:e>, therapy was not successful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In this case, a marrow intoxication was presumably responsible for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and the dog was euthanized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In two of the remaining three cases, therapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">Cyclosporin A</z:chebi> was successful; the last dog is still being treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">Cyclosporin A</z:chebi> at this time </plain></SENT>
