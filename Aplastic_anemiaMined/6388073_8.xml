<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since CsA is extensively metabolized and subject to biliary elimination, CsA courses were divided according to the presence (serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> greater than 2.0 mg/dl) or absence (serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16990">bilirubin</z:chebi> less than or equal to 1.2 mg/dl) of hepatic dysfunction </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum CsA concentrations were measured concurrently by radioimmunoassay (RIA) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serum concentration-time data were analyzed by standard nonlinear regression methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Systemic clearance (<z:chebi fb="193" ids="17996">Cls</z:chebi>) calculated from HPLC results was higher than that derived from RIA results, regardless of hepatic function (P less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that results obtained by RIA overestimate CSP concentrations, presumably because of the presence of crossreactive CSP metabolites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These differences can significantly affect derived pharmacokinetic parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, clinicians who make dosage recommendations based on pharmacokinetic parameters should consider the effect of assay method </plain></SENT>
