<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During remission induction, fatal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> occurred in 0.7% of the patients whereas, during the same time, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> were four times more frequent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Platelet concentrates (PC) were usually given on the basis of clinical indications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When the risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> was especially high, as during the induction phase of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004836'>acute promyelocytic leukemia</z:hpo>, prophylactic platelet transfusions seemed to be necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948201" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Alloimmunization</z:e> developed in 17% to 52% of the patients depending on their cytologic type and in these cases, PC prepared from single donors had to be used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among the 57 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA), bone marrow transplantation was indicated in 17, and 5 of the 10 grafted patients died from <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In AA, as the risk of sensitization to platelet alloantigens was higher, PC prepared from single donors were systematically preferred to standard PC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>If bone marrow transplantation was planned, PC from histocompatible donors were ordered </plain></SENT>
