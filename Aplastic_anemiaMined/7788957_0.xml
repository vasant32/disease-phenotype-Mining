<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report a retrospective analysis of the experience of a single centre in treating severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (SAA) with allogeneic bone marrow transplant (BMT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Between 1982 and 1992, we transplanted 21 patients with SAA (14 males, 7 females); median age at BMT was 15 y (range 2-40 y); median time from diagnosis of SAA to BMT was 29 d (range 6 d-5.5 y) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients had received multiple transfusions before BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were conditioned with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> 50 mg/kg for 4 d, +/- total body irradiation 300-500 cGy as a single fraction; 1 patient received total nodal irradiation (750 cGy) plus antithymocyte globulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sixteen patients received bone marrow from human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-identical siblings, 3 from haplo-identical parents, and 2 from unrelated volunteer donors; <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) prophylaxis was variable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three patients failed to fully engraft following BMT; 2 achieved successful engraftment following a second BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Six of 20 evaluable patients (30%) developed grade II-IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD, of whom 3 died; 3 patients developed limited and 5 patients (31%) developed extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD, of whom 1 died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients (67%) are alive and well following BMT with a median follow-up of 6 y (range 2.1-11 y) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Survival was superior in patients receiving sibling-donor BMT (75%) compared with those receiving parent- or unrelated-donor BMT (40%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that allogeneic BMT remains an important mode of treatment for SAA, but long-term survival remains limited by graft failure and GVHD </plain></SENT>
