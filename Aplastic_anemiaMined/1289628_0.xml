<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We assessed pulmonary function and exercise tolerance in 10 BMT patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Their underlying disorders were as follows; <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> 5 cases, <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> 2 cases, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> and non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> one case each </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Their mean age was 26 +/- 9 years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When the patients were healthy and free of serious complications and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, arterial blood gas examination, pulmonary function tests and incremental treadmill exercise test were examined repeatedly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although %VC and FEV1.0% kept within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range, PaO2 at rest, %DLCO, VO2max, VO2max/kg and O2-pulsemax remained low at one year after BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were significant correlations between VO2max and O2-pulsemax [r = 0.955 (p &lt; 0.001)], %VC [r = 0.758 (p &lt; 0.02)], VE/VO2max [r = -0.749 (p &lt; 0.02)] and delta SaO2/<z:chebi fb="1" ids="30047">VO2</z:chebi>/kg [r = -0.731 (p &lt; 0.02)], suggesting that <z:hpo ids='HP_0003546'>exercise intolerance</z:hpo> in BMT patients may be based on both cardiac and gas exchange abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To evaluate cardiac dysfunction, we compared exercise parameters obtained at an exercise level of 75% predicted heart rate max in five age-matched <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects to those in six BMT patients who did not demonstrate desaturation during exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As a result, the mean values of VO2max/kg and O2-pulse/m2 in BMT patients were significantly lower than those in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects, suggesting that cardiac dysfunction may be due to insufficiency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001297'>stroke</z:hpo> volume during exercise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that <z:hpo ids='HP_0003546'>exercise intolerance</z:hpo> in BMT patients may be mainly due to cardiac dysfunction </plain></SENT>
