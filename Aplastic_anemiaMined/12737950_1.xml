<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The evolution of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> syndromes such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) to clonal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic diseases</z:e> such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> is well recognized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic abnormalities are commonly seen late events, particularly <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> of chromosomes 7 and 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A proportion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> patients may also develop <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> that is detectable by fluorescence in situ hybridization but not by standard cytogenetic analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The molecular basis for <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> in this setting is currently unknown but may include abnormalities in the mitotic spindle checkpoint </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For this reason, we searched for mutations in the mitotic spindle checkpoint genes hBUB1 and hMAD2, and also examined the expression of hBUB1 in cells of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No pathogenic mutations were found in 59 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of 170 <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> patients, less than one-third expressed hBUB1 transcript </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Gene expression profiling confirmed a significant down-regulation of hBUB1 message in patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that mutations in mitotic spindle checkpoint genes do not account for <z:mp ids='MP_0004024'>aneuploidy</z:mp> in marrow failure states </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, we cannot exclude epigenetic inactivation of hBUB1 as a potential mechanism in some patients </plain></SENT>
