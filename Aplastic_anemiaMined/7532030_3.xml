<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Similarly, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002843'>abnormalities of T cells</z:hpo> and bone marrow stromal cells have been reported in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, as has abnormal cytokine production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Stem cell factor (SCF) (also known as kit ligand, mast cell growth factor and Steel factor) is an early acting hematopoietic growth factor that is produced by a variety of mesenchymal cells including bone marrow stromal cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To determine whether abnormalities in the production of stem cell factor occur in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, we evaluated serum levels of SCF in 25 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean serum levels of SCF in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> patients were significantly lower (2.7 +/- 1.1 ng/ml) than those found in a comparable population of 257 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (3.3 +/- 1.1 ng/ml) (P = 0.011) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The SCF level did not correlate with patient age, the duration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> or with white blood cell count, platelet count or hematocrit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although there is no direct evidence that lower SCF serum levels contribute to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> seen in this disorder, identification of underlying abnormalities that can result in the deficient production of stromally derived hematopoietic growth factors will be important </plain></SENT>
