<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although GATA-2 expression was reported to be decreased in CD34-positive cells in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, many questions remain regarding the intrinsic characteristics of hematopoietic stem cells in this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we identified HOXB4 as a downstream target of GATA-2 based on expression profiling with human cord blood-derived CD34-positive cells infected with control or GATA-2 lentiviral shRNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To confirm the functional link between GATA-2 and HOXB4, we conducted GATA-2 gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments, and HOXB4 promoter analysis, including luciferase assay, in vitro DNA binding analysis and quantitative ChIP analysis, using K562 and CD34-positive cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The analyses suggested that GATA-2 directly regulates HOXB4 expression through the GATA sequence in the promoter region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we assessed GATA-2 and HOXB4 expression in CD34-positive cells from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (n = 10) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001973'>idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura</z:hpo> (n = 13), and demonstrated that the expression levels of HOXB4 and GATA-2 were correlated in these populations (r = 0.6573, p&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results suggested that GATA-2 directly regulates HOXB4 expression in hematopoietic stem cells, which may play an important role in the development and/or progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
