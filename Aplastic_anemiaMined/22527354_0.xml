<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Engraftment was achieved in 45 (93.75 %) patients after <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MSD</z:e>-hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and in 33 (86.8 %) after MUD-HSCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Transplant-related mortality rate after <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MSD</z:e>-HSCT was 8 %, while 37 % after MUD-HSCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MSD</z:e>-HSCT 44 (91.7 %) patients are alive for 1-216 months (median: 85 months), while after MUD-HSCT 24 (63.2 %) patients for 1-84 months (median: 16 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 5-year probability of event-free survival after <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MSD</z:e>-HSCT and MUD-HSCT was 87 and 53 %, respectively, while 5 years of overall survival was 91 and 64 %, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It was concluded that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MSD</z:e>-HSCT as the first line treatment for children with SAA is a safe therapeutic approach with a low rate of treatment failures and excellent outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results of MUD-HSCT in pediatric patients with SAA who failed to respond to immunosuppressive therapy are still inferior than those of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MSD</z:e>-HSCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Treatment failures of MUD-HSCT are mainly related to infectious complications and graft failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It seems, however, that HLA-matching of unrelated donors at allelic level along with early MUD-HSCT after FCA (FLUDA, low-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, and anti-thymocyte globulin) conditioning, perhaps using lower Thymoglobulin dose could enable further improvement of long-term results in children with SAA who lack <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MSD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
