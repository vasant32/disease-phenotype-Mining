<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These patients received non-T-cell-depleted allogeneic bone marrow transplantation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> in two cases and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> in eight cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Five grafts were fully matched, three were one antigen-mismatched, and two were two antigen-mismatched </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Despite GVHD prophylaxis with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> and short-term <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi>, AGVHD occurred after a median of 24 days and clearly progressed under <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> (median 2 mg/kg), given for a median of 12 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>25.3 mAb was given at a dosage of 0.1 mg/kg in a 4-h perfusion for five daily doses without any clinical or biological side effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirty percent of the patients experienced a reduction in the overall grading with two complete responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Partial response in at least one involved organ (mostly skin) occurred in 80% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, seven out of the eight responding patients experienced a new episode of AGVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This observation, which confirms that inhibiting a functional molecule is as efficient as a cytolytic therapy, offers an alternative strategy to antithymocyte globulin (ATG) and cytotoxic mAb in controlling steroid-resistant GVHD </plain></SENT>
