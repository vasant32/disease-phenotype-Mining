<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The indications were <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) (30), nonlymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (24), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (15), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> (47), and miscellaneous conditions (10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of these, 21 (17%) underwent 22 open-lung biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fourteen of these patients showed no causative microorganism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When a cause was found it was <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> (usually cytomegalovirus [CMV]) in three, fungal in one, Pneumocystis carinii alone in two, both <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> and pneumocystis in one, and a combination of <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp>, and pneumocystis in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients died due to continued deterioration after the biopsy </plain></SENT>
