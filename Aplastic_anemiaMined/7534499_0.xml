<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although CD48 is an activation antigen of lymphocytes and monocytes, whether it is an activation antigen of neutrophils has not previously been examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Herein, using FACS analysis, we examined the expression of surface CD48 on neutrophils activated in vivo by G-CSF administered for the treatment of idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CD48 expression was increased 24 h after the initial G-CSF infusion and peaked within 1 week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Within a few days after discontinuation of G-CSF administration, it returned to the pretreatment level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This indicates that CD48 is an activation antigen of neutrophils </plain></SENT>
