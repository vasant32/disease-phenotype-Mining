<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In our preliminary study we have introduced cyclosporin in the aplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> treatment to evaluate its effect on the disease evolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ten aplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> patients, mean age 33.33 +/- 20.01 years, were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> (9 +/- 2.35 mg/kg/d), <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> (0.5 mg/kg/d) and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="50113">androgens</z:chebi> (1 mg/kg/d) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> was always combined with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="5" ids="50113">androgens</z:chebi> were administered concomitantly with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> or alternately </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seven patients responded to the treatment after a median remission delay of 6 weeks (2-12 weeks) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>They became independent of blood requirements at a median of 36 weeks (8-108 weeks); the three other patients died during the first trimester without showing any improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among the seven responders, two relapsed early and transiently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The rate of actuarial survival was 70 per cent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The median duration of survival was 10.5 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The side effects observed included one case of malignant <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, six cases of liver toxicity and five cases of kidney toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This toxicity was reversible after dose adjustment of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In our study, the introduction of cyclosporin in the aplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> treatment resulted in improved therapeutic response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="5" ids="50113">Androgens</z:chebi> should be used to maintain the haematologic response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This therapeutic protocol associated with drug monitoring seems promising and the side effects should not limit its use because of the severity of the underlying disease </plain></SENT>
