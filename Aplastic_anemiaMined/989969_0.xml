<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Sera from 23 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001973'>idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi>), 14 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> and healthy control subjects were tested for the presence of fibrinogen/fibrin degradation products (FDP), using the tanned red cell hemagglutination inhibition immunoaassay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The concentrations of circulating FDP of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> patients (mean 12.01 mug/ml) were significantly higher than those of the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (mean 4.01 mug/ml, p less than 0.05) or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (mean 3.10 mug/ml, p less than 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients with untreated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> with very <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>low platelet counts</z:hpo> had higher levels of FDP than those of the treated group (p less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum FDP and a battery of other coagulation-fibrinolysis tests were serially carried out over a period of 10 weeks in two patients with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The initially high FDP promptly decreased as circulating <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0836924" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">platelets increased</z:e> in response to steroid in both patients, while plasma fibrinogen, euglobulin lysis time, prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time remained essentially <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> during the course of observation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The exact source of the increased serum FDP in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> was not established, but a few possible mechanisms responsible for this abnormality were discussed </plain></SENT>
