<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fluorescent intensity distribution of mNAP was analyzed using FACS (fluorescence-activated cell sorter) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) of the mNAP in this assay was well correlated with the neutrophil ALP (NAP) score demonstrated cytochemically (r = 0.832) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>mNAP levels in various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0947743,C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematological disorders</z:e> were evaluated by % mNAP+ cells and MFI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The levels in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001901'>polycythemia</z:hpo> vera were significantly higher, and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004818'>paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>), the levels were significantly lower compared with the levels in healthy volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two-color immunofluorescence with anti-ALP and anti-CD16 showed that the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> clone was essentially negative for mNAP, whereas residual <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> neutrophils (CD16+) had levels slightly higher than those in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Highly reproducible results were obtained in the blood samples which were stored at 4 degrees C for at least 24 hr without any treatment prior to immunofluorescent staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No degradation of fluorescent intensity was seen 4 days after staining and fixation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mNAP assay is simple, without subjective evaluation for quantification, and is useful for differential diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0947743,C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematological disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
