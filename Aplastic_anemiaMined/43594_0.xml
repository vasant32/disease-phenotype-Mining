<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors show that it is extremely difficult to cure patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0679247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">end stage disease</z:e> by this procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Based on experience that, if performed early, BMT can bring about over 50% potential cures, it is postulated that marrow grafts should be performed much earlier than is done at present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From the results in 45 patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> it is concluded that the majority do not have a defect at the pluripotent stem cell itself </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There is disturbed maturation to functional end cells which can be corrected in most instances by ALG, infusion of allogeneic marrow and low dose <z:chebi fb="5" ids="50113">androgens</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>BMT between HLA-identical siblings need not cause major problems, but it involves a considerable risk of fatal complications such as irreversible marrow rejection and GvH </plain></SENT>
