<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients were assessed at 3, 6, and 12 months after initiation of treatment by three criteria: transfusion independence, clinical improvement, and blood counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Group I consisted of 77 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, randomized to receive either ten or 28 days of ATG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference between the two arms of this protocol: 47% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were clinically improved and 31% were transfusion independent at 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the severely affected patients, 27% died before 3 months; most <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occurred early in treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Factors associated with survival in severely affected patients included male sex, age less than 40 years, absolute neutrophil count greater than 200/microL, and idiopathic etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neutrophil counts generally increased by 8 weeks after treatment, but patients continued to show improvement to 1 year posttreatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In Group II, 44 patients with moderate or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> were randomized to receive either ten days of ATG or 3 months of high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="7466">nandrolone</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27689">decanoate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No patient initially treated with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="50113">androgens</z:chebi> recovered, but 28% of ATG-treated cases achieved transfusion independence at 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Group III consisted of patients with a variety of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> and cellular bone marrow showed response rates similar to those of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> or moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
