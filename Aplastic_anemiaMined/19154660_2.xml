<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A pivotal regulator of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> is vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our study assesses VEGF expression and microvessel density (MVD) in the bone marrow of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHOD: Bone marrow specimens from 25 patients with AA and 15 controls were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MVD was calculated on sections stained immunohistochemically for CD34 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the cases were studied for VEGF expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Bone marrow MVD in patients with AA was significantly lower than that in controls (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was a significant MVD difference between severe AA and moderate AA (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>VEGF expression was also significantly lower in AA cases compared to controls (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our data show that AA is associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0005602'>reduced angiogenesis</z:mp> and reduced VEGF expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Defective <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> may result in or aggravate bone marrow <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> in AA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There are limited studies on this aspect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>More studies to confirm the present hypothesis might pave the way for new treatment options in AA </plain></SENT>
