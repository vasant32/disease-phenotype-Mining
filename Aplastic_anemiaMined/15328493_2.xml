<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, its use has been associated with a risk of side-effects involving <z:mp ids='MP_0000334'>agranulocytosis</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These reactions are rare and unpredictable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the risks of these complications in Poland, where this medication is available without prescription </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL/METHODS: Six hematological centers, serving approximately 40% (ca </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35610">cytostatic</z:chebi> or immunosuppressive drugs were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the 12 months of the study, 2 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and no cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0000334'>agranulocytosis</z:mp> were confirmed which may have been associated with the use of metamizole </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overall, we recorded 16 cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0000334'>agranulocytosis</z:mp> and 27 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The two cases of metamizole <z:chebi fb="199" ids="26708">sodium</z:chebi>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> were non-fatal in character </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Considering the consumption of 112,300,094 tablets of metamizole in Poland a year, the figures obtained result in an incidence of 0.25 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> per 1 million persons per day of treatment; this value being less than that for other <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35475">nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, caution is recommended in the application of metamizole, particularly over long periods and in large doses </plain></SENT>
