<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to analyze our experience with granulocyte transfusions in such patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> who had received granulocyte transfusions between 1997 and 2007 in our institute </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Survival to hospital discharge was the primary outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Secondary outcomes included microbiological, radiographic and clinical responses of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> at 7 and 30 days after initiating granulocyte therapy, and post-transfusion absolute neutrophil count, stratified by HLA <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948201" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">alloimmunization</z:e> status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-two patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> underwent granulocyte transfusions; the majority had received horse antithymocyte globulin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One quarter of patients had demonstrable HLA <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948201" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">alloimmunization</z:e> prior to the initiation of granulocyte therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Infections</z:e> were evenly divided between invasive <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026946" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fungal infections</z:e> unresponsive to maximal antibiotic and/or antifungal therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median number of granulocyte components transfused was nine (range, 2-43) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The overall survival to hospital discharge was 58% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Survival was strongly correlated with hematopoietic recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Among the 18 patients who had invasive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026946" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fungal infections</z:e>, 44% survived to hospital discharge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Response at 7 and 30 days correlated with survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The mean post-transfusion absolute neutrophil count did not differ significantly between response groups (i.e. patients grouped according to whether they had complete or partial resolution of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, stable disease or progressive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>There was also no difference in mean post-transfusion absolute neutrophil count between the patients divided according to HLA <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948201" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">alloimmunization</z:e> status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Granulocyte transfusions may have an adjunctive role in severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> in patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>HLA <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948201" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">alloimmunization</z:e> is not an absolute contraindication to granulocyte therapy </plain></SENT>
