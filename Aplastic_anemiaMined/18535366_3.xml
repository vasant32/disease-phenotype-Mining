<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>So far, few studies have evaluated the roles of NKT cells in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA), an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we investigated the quantitative and qualitative changes in NKT cells in bone marrow (BM) mononuclear cells of AA patients in response to in vitro stimulation with alpha-galactosylceramide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Compared to healthy controls, BM from AA patients had reduced fraction of NKT cells, which possessed a decreased potential to expand in vitro in response to alpha-galactosylceramide stimulation, producing more IFNgamma+ NKT1 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the presence of rhG-CSF, the expansion capacity of NKT cells stimulated by alpha-galactosylceramide was significantly reduced in both AA and control groups, with the majority of the activated NKT cells expressing intracellular IL-4, and the fractions of IFNgamma+ NKT cells were significantly reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In summary, our results indicate that polarization of NKT cells towards the NKT2 subpopulation occurs after co-stimulation with alpha-galactosylceramide and rhG-CSF in AA </plain></SENT>
