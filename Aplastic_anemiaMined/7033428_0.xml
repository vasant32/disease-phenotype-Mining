<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A patient with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> underwent bone marrow transplantation from her HLA identical sister after a prolonged transfusion history and clinical evidence of shortened red cell and platelet survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Following the transplant, she exhibited minimal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft vs. host disease</z:e> which resolved, and was discharged with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> blood counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because of falling hemoglobulin, platelets and white blood cell counts 8 weeks following the transplant, graft rejection was suspected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>High dose steroid therapy apparently had no effect, since the hematologic parameters continued to fall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>She underwent two plasma exchanges, after which <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> hematologic parameters returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, and she continues to exhibit <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> parameters seven months after the transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although other explanations for the reversal of the apparent graft rejection can be considered, the case is presented to call attention to the possibility that plasma exchange, by possibly removing circulating inhibitors of bone marrow function, may be useful and simple method for dealing with graft rejection </plain></SENT>
