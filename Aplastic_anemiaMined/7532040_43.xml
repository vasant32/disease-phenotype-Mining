<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (SAA) and a neutrophil (PMN) count of less than 0.5 x 10(9)/L are exposed to a high risk of early mortality when treated with antilymphocyte globulin (ALG) and steroids, with the major problem being infectious complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The addition of human recombinant granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF) to ALG may reduce early mortality by improving neutrophil counts in the short term </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To test the feasibility of this approach, the SAA Working Party of the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) designed a pilot study that included rhG-CSF (5 micrograms/kg/d, days 1 through 90), horse ALG (HALG; 15 mg/kg/d, days 1 through 5), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi> (2 mg/kg/d, days 1 through 5, then tapering the dose), and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> (CyA; 5 mg/kg/d orally, days 1 through 180) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with newly diagnosed acquired SAA (untreated) and with neutrophil counts of &lt; or = 0.5 x 10(9)/L were eligible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Forty consecutive patients entered this study and are evaluable with a minimum follow up of 120 days: the median age was 16 years (range, 2 to 72 years), the interval from diagnosis to treatment was 24 days, and the median PMN count was 0.19 x 10(9)/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one patients had <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhages</z:mp>, and 19 were infected at the time of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall, treatment was well tolerated: the median maximum PMN count during rhG-CSF administration was 12 x 10(9)/L (range, 0.4 x 10(9)/L to 44 x 10(9)/L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were three early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> (8%) due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Four patients (10%) showed no recovery, whereas 33 patients (82%) had trilineage hematologic reconstitution and became transfusion-independent at a median interval of 115 days from treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Median follow up for surviving patients is 428 days (range, 122 to 1,005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Actuarial survival is 92%: 86% and 100% for patients with PMN counts less than 0.2 x 10(9)/L or between 0.2 x 10(9)/L and 0.5 x 10(9)/L, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that the addition of rhG-CSF to ALG and CyA is well tolerated, is associated with a low risk of mortality, and offers a good chance of hematologic response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This protocol would appear to be an interesting alternative treatment for SAA patients with a low PMN count who lack an HLA-identical sibling </plain></SENT>
