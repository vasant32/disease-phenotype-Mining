<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Genetic predisposition has been shown to play a role in a considerable proportion of SAA cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For instance, the human lymphocyte antigen HLA-DR2 has been repeatedly demonstrated to be over-represented in SAA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this paper, we expand on the evidence for the contribution of HLA polymorphism in the susceptibility to SAA, which was obtained using the "high-resolution" technique of HLA-DRB1 subtyping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The DRB1*1501 allele appeared to be responsible for the predominance of DR2 specificity in SAA patients and was the most significant risk factor for this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It was observed in 23/44 (52.3%) patients versus 22/100 (22.0%) donors [odds ratio (OR) = 3.9; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.8-8.3; P = 0.0005, corrected P (Pc) &lt; 0.05] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, DRB1*04 alleles also displayed non-random distribution in the SAA group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In particular, DRB1*04 variants coding for alanine at position 74 of the DR beta 1 chain (HLA-DR4-Ala74 beta subtype) were detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 13 DR4-positive SAA patients but only in 15/24 (62.5%) controls (OR = 16.6; 95% CI: 0.9-312.0; P = 0.015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multiple comparison analysis confirmed that the HLA-DR4-Ala74 beta subtype confers susceptibility to SAA independently from the DRB1*1501 allele </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Finally, examination of the clinical records has shown that the HLA-DR4-Ala74 beta subtype is associated with poor outcome of SAA </plain></SENT>
