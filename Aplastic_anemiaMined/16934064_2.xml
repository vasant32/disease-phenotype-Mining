<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Platelet (PLT) concentrates are currently stored in an incubator at 20 to 24 degrees C with continuous gentle <z:hpo ids='HP_0000713'>agitation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PLTs are routinely shipped for transfusion to thrombocytopenic patients, however </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There is a concern that PLT concentrates may be adversely affected during the shipping process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: A 40-year-old woman with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and immune refractory to unselected PLT transfusions was transferred to a distant medical center for a hematopoietic peripheral blood progenitor cell transplant where she continued to receive HLA-matched PLTs from her dedicated donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sixteen such components were collected and air-shipped in insulated boxes to the transplant center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirty-seven plateletpheresis components from the same dedicated donors had been transfused to the patient before transfer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Corrected count increments (CCIs) at the two sites were compared, with assessment of the role of HLA-match grades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean interruption time of controlled <z:hpo ids='HP_0000713'>agitation</z:hpo> during shipment was approximately 10.5 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean CCI of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> distant transfusions was 14,450 +/- 9700 PLTs per microL x m2 per 10(11) and that of local transfusions was 10730 +/- 4870 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The mean donor-paired difference between CCIs at the two sites was 1140 +/- 9940 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At the remote location no clinically significant <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> occurred and one posttransfusion febrile reaction was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Despite the study limitations, the effectiveness, in a single patient, of leukoreduced, irradiated apheresis PLTs shipped by lengthy combined surface and airline transport is reported, as measured by posttransfusion CCIs </plain></SENT>
