<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Four patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0004313'>hypogammaglobulinemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Lymphocytes from ten patients without and one with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004313'>hypogammaglobulinemia</z:hpo> were capable of differentiating into lg-producing cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Lymphocytes from three patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004313'>hypogammaglobulinemia</z:hpo>, however, were unable to differentiate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Coculture experiments showed that in one patient helper activity of T cells was impaired, in another patient B cells could not be stimulated by PWM to differentiate even in the presence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> T cells, and in a third patient both the helper function of T cells and the capacity of B cells to differentiate into lg-producing cells were affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that differentiation of lymphoid cells is impaired in some cases of idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004313'>hypogammaglobulinemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
