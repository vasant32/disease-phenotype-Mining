<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Two main factors have been implicated in the mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>: environmental factors and genetic susceptibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Individuals vary in their ability to metabolize several DNA-damaging agents due to polymorphisms of biotransforming enzymes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Genetically determined differences in the expression of these enzymes could explain interindividual risks in developing acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to characterize the genetic polymorphism of biotransforming phase I (p450-cyp2E1) and phase II [microsomal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32955">epoxide</z:chebi> hydrolase (mEh), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> S-transferase (GST)] enzymes in pediatric patients with acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The GSTT1 null genotype (absence of both alleles) was associated with a significantly increased risk for acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (odds ratio, 2.8; 95% confidence interval, 0.15-5.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the GSTM1 null genotype or polymorphisms within the p450-cyp2E1 and mEh genes was not significantly different in patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis was performed to assess whether the enzymes together or with other variables as age, gender, or response to therapy may have any significant association with the tested genotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In no combinations of the mentioned parameters was an association found with acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>GST are mainly involved in metabolizing hematotoxic and mutagenic substrates such as <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> derivatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The GSTT1 null genotype may modulate the metabolism of exogenous pollutants or toxic intermediates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The absence of the GSTT1 enzyme, leading to genetic susceptibility toward certain pollutants, might determine the individual risk for development of acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> in children </plain></SENT>
