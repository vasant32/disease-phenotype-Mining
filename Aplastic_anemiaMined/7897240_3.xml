<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using a murine model for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD caused by injection of parental C57Bl/6 splenocytes into unirradiated (C57Bl/6 x <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi>/2) F1 hybrids, we demonstrated that pretreatment of the inocula with a novel <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressant</z:chebi>, B subunit of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0008354" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cholera</z:e> toxin (CT-B) impaired the ability of C57Bl/6 T cells to induce <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD in F1 recipients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>F1 mice injected with CT-B-treated C57Bl/6 splenocytes did not develop significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001744'>splenomegaly</z:hpo>, and no antihost CTLs were found in their spleens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, these mice did not suffer from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, nor from general immunosuppression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunofluorescence studies suggest that treatment of the inducing inocula with CT-B selectively prevents accumulation of the host-reactive CD8+ T cells in F1 mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, our experiments demonstrated that CT-B treatment does not impair the ability of BM progenitors to form colonies in semisolid culture or in lethally irradiated hosts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, taken together, our data suggest that ex vivo CT-B treatment can be used in allogeneic BM transplantation to prevent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD </plain></SENT>
