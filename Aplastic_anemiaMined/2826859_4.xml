<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most reported cases have developed after non-A, non-B or B type <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The only case of PHAA occurring after <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> A reported so far, was described by Smith et al., who diagnosed it by the long-term elevation of IgG-class antibody in response to <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> A virus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recently, the detection of IgM-class antibody specific against <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> A virus (IgM anti-HAV) has been commonly employed for precise diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The case reported here is the first case of PHAA occurring after <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> A to be diagnosed by radioimmunoassay of IgM anti-HAV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, evidence is presented suggesting that the PHAA may have been an immune-related response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Addition of the patient's peripheral T-lymphocytes to cultures of her own bone marrow cells resulted in a reduction in the number of colony-forming units in culture (CFU-C) </plain></SENT>
