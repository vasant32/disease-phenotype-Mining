<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We were able to isolate CFU-F free of contaminating hemopoietic progenitors and are beginning to construct a detailed picture of their cell surface phenotype and have developed assays to examine the conditions required for their growth and differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the future, we hope to determine whether multipotential stromal stem cells exist in human bone marrow and to establish culture conditions that selectively promote self-renewal or development along any of a number of stromal cell lineages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Such cells would be an ideal target for gene therapy and may provide a means of treating disorders of the hemopoietic system with a suspected stromal etiology, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have recently succeeded in generating bone cells from STRO-1+ marrow cells (Gronthos et al, in preparation) and thus marrow stromal cell precursors may also find application in the treatment of other disorders such as those of the osteogenic system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For the present, these must remain tantalizing possibilities </plain></SENT>
