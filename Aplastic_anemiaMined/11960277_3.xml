<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We observed this phenomenon in a boy transplanted because of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> up to 9 weeks after CsA had been switched from intravenous to oral administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In comparison to phlebotomy, simultaneous blood sampling from the double lumen catheter resulted in a greater than 10-fold, or two-fold increase in drug levels, respectively, depending on whether or not the line used for prior CsA infusion was selected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, prolonged binding of CsA to the inner surface of venous catheters should also be considered during oral administration </plain></SENT>
