<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, only 25 to 30 percent of potential recipients have HLA-identical siblings who can act as donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 1986 the National Marrow Donor Program was created in the United States to facilitate the finding and procurement of suitable marrow from unrelated donors for patients lacking related donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: During the first four years of the program, 462 patients with acquired and congenital lymphohematopoietic disorders or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025517" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">metabolic diseases</z:e> received marrow transplants from unrelated donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The probability of engraftment by 100 days after transplantation was 94 percent, although 8 percent of patients later had secondary graft failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The probability of grade II, III, or IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> was 64 percent, and the probability of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> at one year was 55 percent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The rate of disease-free survival at two years among patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and good prognostic factors was 40 percent and among patients at higher risk, 19 percent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty-nine percent of the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> were alive at two years, and the rate of two-year disease-free survival among patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> was 18 percent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For patients with congenital immunologic or nonimmunologic disorders, the probability of survival was 52 percent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The National Marrow Donor Program has benefited a substantial number of patients in need of marrow transplants from closely HLA-matched unrelated donors and has facilitated the recruitment of unrelated donors into the donor pool and the access to suitable marrow </plain></SENT>
