<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eleven of 22 patients (50 percent) had a significant hematologic response within three months of therapy, confirming the effectiveness of this therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment fetal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> concentration, age, sex, severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo>, degree of maximal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001888'>lymphopenia</z:hpo>, and total hemolytic complement consumption did not affect response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with severe disease who were treated within 16 weeks after diagnosis had a higher response rate (55 percent) than those treated after 16 weeks (20 percent) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In patients with severe disease, a higher pretherapy bone marrow cellularity (p less than 0.001) and presence of granulocyte-macrophage colony growth correlated with response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The actuarial survival of patients with response in the group with severe disease was 100 percent at 12 months as compared with 33 percent in patients without response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Following anti-thymocyte globulin therapy, a reduced number of blood lymphocyte T subpopulations was seen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At three months after therapy, the patients with response who had severe disease had increased T8-positive cells (+56 percent versus -4 percent for patients without response) and la-positive cells (+32 percent versus -62 percent) </plain></SENT>
