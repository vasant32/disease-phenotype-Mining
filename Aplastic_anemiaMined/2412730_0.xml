<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report a case of Fanconi's <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> with an extremely high proportion of fetal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (Hb F) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A three-year-old girl with multiple birth defects, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001249'>mental retardation</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> consistent with Fanconi's <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> showed Hb AF by electrophoresis; the Kleihauer smear showed Hb F in 70% of her erythrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Total Hb concentration was 34 g/L, mean corpuscular volume 119 fL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The proportion of Hb F was 45% by densitometry, 36% by radial immunodiffusion, and 30% by <z:chebi fb="36" ids="36916">cation</z:chebi>-exchange microchromatography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The Hb A2 was 0.5%; glycated Hb was 7.8% by affinity chromatography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sample volume was insufficient for alkali denaturation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As exemplified with this patient, we recommend microchromatographic <z:chebi fb="36" ids="36916">cation</z:chebi>-exchange assay when Hb F exceeds 30% by densitometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Here the effect of contamination by Hb A1 was lessened by the high proportion of Hb F </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="36" ids="36916">Cation</z:chebi>-exchange microchromatography provides clinically relevant Hb F values more quickly than radial immunodiffusion and more conveniently than alkali denaturation </plain></SENT>
