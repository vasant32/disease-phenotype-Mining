<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Forty-three femoral heads in twenty-six cases with idiopathic femoral head <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> (n = 2), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (n = 22), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (n = 1), and renal transplantation (n = 1) were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis for femoral head <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> was based on magnetic resonance imaging as well as other diagnostic studies in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Scintigraphic findings of planar and SPECT images were classified into six categories: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (N); cold or decrease (C); partial increase with cold or decrease (PH+C); ring-like increase with a cold center (RH+C); partial increase (PH); diffuse and/or irregular increase (DH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0010885'>Avascular necrosis</z:hpo> was confirmed in twenty-four femoral heads, in which planar and SPECT images showed scintigraphic findings of N (n = 3, 2), C (n = 1, 3), PH+C (n = 2, 8), RH+C (n = 2, 3), PH (n = 9, 2), and DH (n = 7, 6), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Femoral heads without <z:hpo ids='HP_0010885'>avascular necrosis</z:hpo> demonstrated planar and SPECT findings of N (n = 16, 12), C (n = 0, 6), and DH (n = 3, 1), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When considering C, PH+C, and RH+C as diagnostic findings for <z:hpo ids='HP_0010885'>avascular necrosis</z:hpo>, sensitivities of planar and SPECT images were 21% and 58%, and specificities were 100% and 68%, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
