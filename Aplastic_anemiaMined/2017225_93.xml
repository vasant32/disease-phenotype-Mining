<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The best results are achieved with antilymphocyte globulin or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients have been treated successfully with a combination of both agents, but there has been no controlled evaluation of its efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We conducted a randomized, multicenter trial in 84 patients not eligible for bone marrow transplantation, comparing treatment with antilymphocyte globulin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi> (41 patients--the control group) with antilymphocyte globulin, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> (43 patients--the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At three months significantly more patients in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> group had a complete or partial remission in response to treatment than did patients in the control group (65 percent vs. 39 percent, P less than 0.03); this difference was confirmed at six months (70 percent vs. 46 percent, P less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The superior results of the regimen including <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> were most evident in the patients with severe or very severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, whose response rate at six months was 65 percent, as compared with 31 percent of such patients in the control group (P less than 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Granulocyte and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> levels became <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in most patients who responded, but platelet counts continued to be subnormal in 61 percent of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ten of 52 patients with responses (3 in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> group and 7 in the control group) relapsed 4 to 37 months after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The actuarial survival of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients at 41 months is 64 percent in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> group and 58 percent in the control group (P = 0.16); among the patients with severe or very severe disease, survival is 80 percent and 44 percent, respectively (P = 0.077) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">Cyclosporine</z:chebi> had substantial but reversible side effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Immunosuppressive treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> with antilymphocyte globulin, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> appears to be more effective than a regimen of antilymphocyte globulin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi> without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> and may thus represent a treatment of choice for patients who are not eligible for bone marrow transplantation </plain></SENT>
