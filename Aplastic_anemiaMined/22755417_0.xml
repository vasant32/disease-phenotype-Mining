<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The Institute of Hematology, Peking University, is the largest hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) center in China </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 400 HSCTs performed in 2010 accounted for a quarter of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> allogeneic HSCTs performed in China </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The GIAC protocol, which uses HLA-mismatched/haploidentical blood or bone marrow transplantation without in vitro T-cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath>, entails administration of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> donors, intensified immunological suppression, and treatment with anti-human thymocyte immunoglobulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The stem cell grafts are a combination of G-CSF-primed bone marrow cells and G-CSF-mobilized peripheral blood stem cells, which may be critical to the success of this protocol through the immune modulation of G-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using this protocol, more than 99% engraftment and complete donor chimerism were achieved in pediatric and adult patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) grades 3 and 4 was 13.4% and that of extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD 22.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Comparable relapse rates were observed between patients who received unmanipulated haploidentical transplantation, and those who received HLA-identical or unrelated HSCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Patients with confirmed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e>, (expression levels of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027708" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Wilms' tumor</z:e> suppressor gene 1 and flow cytometry) after HSCT received pre-emptive modified donor lymphocyte infusion to prevent relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Infection</z:e> was the main cause of non-relapse <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Prospective studies are ongoing to investigate the mechanisms of immune reconstitution in order to refine the protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In 1964, a patient with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> received a bone marrow infusion from her syngeneic, pregnant sister, and remained disease-free over a 40-year follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Following this success, there was a 20-year interruption in the transplantation program at our center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The hiatus ended in 1981 with the first allogeneic HSCT, which was used to treat a girl with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In the mid-1990s, the facility performed allo-HSCTs from unrelated donors (URD) and umbilical cord blood (UCB) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Then, in 2000, a patient with refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> received related haploidentical HSCT and achieved long-term survival without relapse over an 11-year followup period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Coincident with the rapid economic development experienced in China since 2000, the transplantation program at our Institute has been expanded to include broadened indications, multiple sources of stem cells and improved outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The Institute is the largest HSCT center in China, now with 130 beds in four wards, 33 of which are laminar-flow rooms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Between 2007 and 2009, over 350 HSCTs were performed per year, rising to a total of 400 in 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Further, in 2010, 94% of these HSCTs were allogeneic transplants, accounting for a quarter of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> allo-HSCTs performed in China </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Of these, transplants from URD accounted for 6%-7%, those using UCB for less than 5%, those from identical siblings for 25%-30%, and those from the related haploidentical for 55%-65% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The most common indications for treatment with allo-HSCT are intermediate-to-high risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>), refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, or severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
