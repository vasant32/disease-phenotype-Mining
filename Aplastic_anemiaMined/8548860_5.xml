<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Marrow stromal <z:mp ids='MP_0002451'>macrophage dysfunction</z:mp> and deficient interleukin-1 production has been reported for patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The stromal macrophage, a target of <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> toxicity, is involved in hematopoietic regulation through the synthesis of several cytokines including interleukin-1, which is required for production by stromal fibroblasts of a number of cytokines required for the survival of hematopoietic progenitor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have previously demonstrated that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17594">hydroquinone</z:chebi>, a major toxic metabolite of <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> in marrow, prevents the proteolytic conversion of 31 kDa pre-interleukin-1 alpha to the 17 kDa cytokine by calpain in purified murine stromal macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, stromal macrophages from <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi>-treated mice produce the 31 kDa pre-interleukin-1 alpha when stimulated in culture with endotoxin, but cannot convert the precursor to interleukin-1 alpha </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In this report, we show that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16509">1,4-benzoquinone</z:chebi>, the oxidation product of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17594">hydroquinone</z:chebi> in the cell, causes a concentration-dependent inhibition of highly purified human platelet calpain with an IC50 of 3 microM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="17594">Hydroquinone</z:chebi> also inhibits the processing of pre-interleukin-1 beta by interleukin-1 beta convertase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The addition of 2 microM <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17594">hydroquinone</z:chebi> to B1 cells that undergo autocrine stimulation by interleukin-1 beta resulted in the cessation of autocrine cell growth and interleukin-1 beta secretion into the culture medium, as determined by Western immunoblots of the culture supernatants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Purified converting enzyme treated with 3 microM <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16509,39439">benzoquinone</z:chebi> was incapable of converting 31 kDa recombinant pre-interleukin-1 beta to the 17 kDa mature cytokine as analyzed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53656">polyacrylamide</z:chebi> gel electrophoresis and Western immunoblotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These findings support our observations in a mouse model that <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi>-induced bone marrow cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> results from a lack of interleukin-1 alpha subsequent to an inhibition by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16509,39439">benzoquinone</z:chebi> of calpain, the protease required for converting pre-interleukin-1 alpha to active cytokine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results may provide a basis for studying <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> in a mouse model </plain></SENT>
