<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report the case of an AA patient who experienced recurrent episodes of ARF, in association with evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A 46-year-old woman with AA was admitted because of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100520'>oliguria</z:hpo> and dark urine following a <z:hpo ids='HP_0000010'>urinary tract infection</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">UTI</z:e>) caused by Candida </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> with ARF complication was diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Hemodialysis treatment was performed nine times and her renal function recovered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, she suffered from recurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0003641'>hemoglobinuria</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> deterioration of renal function 4 months later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The renal biopsy showed features of <z:hpo ids='HP_0008682'>acute tubular necrosis</z:hpo>, deposition of hemosiderin and positive urate stain in the proximal tubular cells, without vascular <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patient received management by adequate hydration, <z:chebi fb="40" ids="35498">diuretics</z:chebi> and alkalization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Her renal function recovered completely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This case report shows an AA patient experiencing recurrent episodes of hemoglobinuric ARF within a short period and achieving complete recovery of renal function after hemodialysis and suitable supportive treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, AA might evolve into <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> and become complicated with presentation of severe ARF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It may occur with precipitating episodes, such as the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">UTI</z:e> in this case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Early recognition of hemoglobinuric complications and prompt treatment for precipitating disease and ARF are important to prevent progression to an irreversible adverse renal outcome </plain></SENT>
