<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Eighty-four patients of the treated group, those with Spleen-Kidney Yang deficiency Syndrome and Spleen-Kidney Yin deficiency Syndrome were treated with SXM-A and SXM-B respectively, and 30 patients of the control group were treated with Stanozolol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The clinical effect and several experimental parameters were also observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The basic cure rate, remission rate, total effective rate of the treated and control group were 21.43%, 27.38%, 86.90% and 3.33%, 20.00%, 56.67% respectively, the difference between 2 groups was significant (P &lt; 0.05, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The effect of the treated group was obviously better than that of the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>While the patients' symptoms were alleviated, the peripheral blood cells increased, the ratio of T lymphocyte subsets tended to balance, the level of natural killer cells activity increased, interleukin 2 reduced, and the reproduction of the bone marrow were markedly improved in most of the patients treated by SXM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: SXM is an effective and safe drug for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Its mechanism might be regulating the immune function, which facilitated the recovery of the bone marrow hematopoiesis function </plain></SENT>
