<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53448">Methylcellulose</z:chebi> semisolid culture was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty patients with SAA at diagnosis were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 90% of the patients, the CFU-E and CFU-GM yields were strikingly decreased and in 56.7% of the patients there was no colony formation at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, there was still 10% of the patients having <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CFU-E, BFU-E or/ and CFU-GM yields </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After IST, 59.1% of the patients showed colony formation improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The difference between the results obtained pre- and post-IST(for CFU-E and BFU-E, P &lt; 0.01, for CFU-GM, P &lt; 0.05) was significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the majority of the patients, the colony formation capacities were still under the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> post-IST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Moreover, 22.7% of the patients remained no colony formation post-IST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The IST response rates between the patients with or without colony formation had no statistically difference (80% versus 50%, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The increment of colony formation appeared later than the therapeutic effect did, but frequently concurred with the appearance of magkaryocytes in the bone marrow smear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In the majority of SAA patients, the hematopoietic stem cells or progenitors were defective perhaps caused by immune damage; IST can improve the hematopoiesis in vitro and in vivo of SAA patients </plain></SENT>
