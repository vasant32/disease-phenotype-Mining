<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 26-year-old ABO-O positive patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> received a bone marrow transplant from his genotypically HLA identical, but ABO-A positive, brother </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Engraftment of myeloid and megakaryocytic lineages occurred within 4 weeks but pure red cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> and transfusion dependent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> persisted for 160 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors postulated that the failure of erythropoiesis was due to a high titer of anti-A isohemagglutinins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They tested this hypothesis with clonal cell cultures and flow cytometric analysis of ABO antigen expression by colony forming cells in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During the period of prolonged red cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath>, the patient had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> numbers (85 +/- 12 per 10(6) cells) of circulating donor derived, burst forming units-erythroid (BFU-E) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immunophenotypic analysis of erythroid burst colonies derived from culture of the patient's bone marrow cells showed that 91 +/- 5% of 274 nucleated red cells were A-antigen positive, confirming full donor engraftment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Autologous plasma and complement added on day 1 of culture did not affect the colony growth (82.5 +/- 15 per 10(6) cells) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, when the addition of complement was delayed until day 7 of culture, there was 90% inhibition of BFU-E (7.5 +/- 5 per 10(6) cells) compared to controls (p less than 0.0004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Based on this, the authors propose a model for expression of ABO antigens during erythropoiesis, in which BFU-E do not express ABO antigens but their progeny do </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The data support the hypothesis that the mechanism of prolonged pure red cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> after ABO-incompatible bone marrow transplantation is complement mediated immune destruction of erythroid progenitors past the stage of BFU-E in differentiation </plain></SENT>
