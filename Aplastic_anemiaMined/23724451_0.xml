<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This is a single institutional review to study the feasibility of using allo-SCT for Thai children with SAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHOD: Nine children with SAA (7 matched-sibling donor-SCT, 1 matched-unrelated donor-SCT and 1 haploidentical-SCT) underwent allo-SCT between October 2002 and September 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">Cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> and anti-thymocyte globulin (CY/ATG) were used as conditioning regimen for 4 patients with matched-sibling donor-SCT CY/ATG and fludarabine were used for 3 patients with matched-sibling donor-SCT and one patient with haplo-identical SCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One matched-unrelated donor-SCT received CY/ATG and total body irradiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eight of 9 patients (89%) achieved neutrophil engraftment within 13.5 days (range 6.0-22.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One matched-sibling donor-SCT recipient who failed to achieve engraftment died from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001919'>acute renal failure</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001795'>gram-negative</z:mp> <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> on day 21 post allo-SCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One matched-sibling donor-SCT case developed late graft failure on day 72 and died from invasive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026946" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fungal infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft versus host disease</z:e> (GVHD), a haplo-identical-SCT patient died from steroid refractory grade IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At last follow-up, six patients (67%) alive at a median follow-up time of 76.4 months (range 2.3-88.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) at 5 year was 63% and 65%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Allo-SCT is a feasible curative treatment for children with SAA in Thailand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Graft failure and severe GVHD in alternative donors SCT are responsible for major causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>OS and EFS probabilities are stable after the first year post transplant </plain></SENT>
