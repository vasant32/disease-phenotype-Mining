<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>19 patients were treated with BMT; 9 are still alive 6 months to 5 years after BMT (47%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>39 patients were treated with ALG; 28 are alive 5 months to 5 years after ALG (72%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>24 of these 28 are self-sustaining and in remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results show that treatment with ALG is probably superior to treatment with BMT, and also demonstrate that most patients with SAA have a pool of hematopoietic stem cells able to repopulate the marrow after this type of treatment </plain></SENT>
