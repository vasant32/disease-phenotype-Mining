<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The introduction of immunosuppressive therapy for treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> has led to a considerable improvement in the prognosis of this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, long-term follow-up of these patients showed a high incidence of "late" hematologic complications such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004818'>paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The detection of the glycosylphosphatitylinositol (GPI)-anchoring defect on peripheral blood cells of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> is now available as a new tool for early specific detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> and is more sensitive than the Ham-test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Granulocytes appear to be the first cells affected in 11 patients with a GPI-anchoring defect of 29 suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> investigated in the present study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The later involvement of erythrocytes and a positive Ham test was observed in 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>From our data it can be concluded that the rate of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> resulting from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> might be higher than reported in the literature when the Ham test alone was used for follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, our results suggest the clinical response to immunosuppressive therapy appears to be worse in the group developing the GPI-anchoring defect than in the group without this deficiency </plain></SENT>
