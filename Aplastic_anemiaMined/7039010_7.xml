<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>High retransplantation titers of ABO isohemagglutinins were successfully reduced by repeated plasmaphereses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Despite gross in vitro incompatibility in the routine crossmatch, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="33353">technetium</z:chebi>-labelled red blood cell survival studies performed immediately prior to transplantation predicted that a small proportion of the donor erythrocytes would neutralize residual postplasmapheresis isoantibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Donor marrow was subsequently infused without significant <z:mp ids='MP_0010163'>hemolysis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although anti-A titers were low immediately posttransplantation, these rose progressively, approaching pretransplantation levels at the time of documented marrow engraftment at day 18 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One week later the bone marrow graft was rejected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Retransplantation was successfully performed using marrow from an ABO compatible, sex-mismatched sibling donor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Radioisotopic studies were helpful in evaluating donor-recipient red blood cell incompatibility during the ABO incompatible transplantation, and again at retransplantation in the presence of circulating isoantibody to donor red blood cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>High levels of ABO isoagglutinins prior to plasmapheresis and rapidly rising titers posttransplantation may have predicted bone marrow graft rejection in this patient </plain></SENT>
