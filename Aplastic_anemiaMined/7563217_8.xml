<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Data from animal models are frequently used in the risk assessment for <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In rodent studies, mice have been shown to be more sensitive to <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi>-induced hematotoxicity than rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this regard, we have observed that bone marrow stromal cells from mice were significantly more susceptible to the cytotoxicity induced by the <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> metabolites <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17594">hydroquinone</z:chebi> (HQ) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16509,39439">benzoquinone</z:chebi> (BQ) than cells from rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Since cellular <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> (GSH) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36141">quinone</z:chebi> reductase (QR) are known to play critical roles in modulating HQ-induced cytotoxicity, we have measured the GSH content and the QR and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> S-transferase (GST) activity in stromal cells from both species </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In rat cells, the GSH content and the QR specific activity were 2 and 28 times as much as those from mice, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>GSH and QR in both mouse and rat stromal cells were inducible by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50866">1,2-dithiole-3-thione</z:chebi> (D3T) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>D3T pretreatment of both mouse and rat stromal cells resulted in a marked protection against HQ-induced toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment of both mouse and rat stromal cells with GSH ethyl <z:chebi fb="21" ids="35701">ester</z:chebi> also provided a dramatic protection against HQ-induced toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Conversely, dicoumarol, an inhibitor of QR, enhanced the HQ-induced toxicity in stromal cells from both mice and rats, indicating an important role for QR in modulating HQ-induced stromal toxicity in both species </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), which depleted GSH significantly in both species, potentiated the HQ-induced toxicity in mouse but not in rat stromal cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Surprisingly, incubation of stromal cells with BSO resulted in a significant induction of QR, especially in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The failure of BSO to potentiate HQ-induced toxicity in rat stromal cells may be due to the concomitant induction of QR by BSO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Overall, this study demonstrates that the differences in stromal cellular GSH content and QR activity between mice and rats contribute to their respective susceptibility to HQ-induced cytotoxicity in vitro, and may be involved in the greater in vivo sensitivity of mice to <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi>-induced hematotoxicity </plain></SENT>
