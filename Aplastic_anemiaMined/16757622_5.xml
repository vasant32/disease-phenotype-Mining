<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It appears in the literature to be an uncommon etiologic agent, yet we encountered several cases in a single year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Each presented problems in laboratory identification and case management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We present two cases of invasive disease with definite identification and susceptibility results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These cases are analyzed in relation to a brief review of previous cases known to have been caused by this species </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our first case involved a 40-year-old male cardiac transplant recipient with multiple <z:hpo ids='HP_0011355'>localized skin lesions</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The second featured a 31-year-old female with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and prolonged <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> who developed disseminated disease, with multiple positive blood cultures and <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both patients died despite aggressive surgical and antifungal therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Fungal susceptibility testing showed that our isolates appeared to be susceptible to <z:chebi fb="1" ids="2682">amphotericin B</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6076">itraconazole</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="10023">voriconazole</z:chebi>, ravuconazole, and posaconazole </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Because phenotypic identification of Phaeoacremonium is notably problematic, sequence-based confirmation was performed using a recently proposed standard based on use of a segment of the 5' end of the beta-tubulin gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Sequences from both isolates involved in the cases were over 99% similar to the corresponding sequence of the ex-type isolate of P. parasiticum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The close DNA similarity, corroborated by relevant morphological similarities (e.g., long, thin phialides and tuberculate hyphae bearing <z:hpo ids='HP_0200043'>warts</z:hpo> up to 3 mum high), confirms these two isolates as P. parasiticum </plain></SENT>
