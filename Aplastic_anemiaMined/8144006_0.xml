<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fifty-five donors and 90 patients with various anemic syndromes (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001891'>iron-deficiency anemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004818'>paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</z:hpo>, autoimmune hemolytic, <z:chebi fb="13" ids="33611">B12</z:chebi>-deficiency, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001908'>hypoplastic anemias</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo>) were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Analysis of peripheral red cell pool helped specify the disease severity, monitor the adequacy of therapy, verify a remission, and predict the process recurrences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Moreover, study of red cell pool fraction composition permits assessment of the individual <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> level of red cells and Hb in human blood, which is significant when making a person's "health passport" </plain></SENT>
