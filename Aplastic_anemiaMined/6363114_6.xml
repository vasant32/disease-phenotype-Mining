<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of them received bone-marrow grafts from HLA matched, MLC nonreactive, sibling donors, were nursed in laminar down-flow isolators with selective gut decontamination, and received GvHD prophylaxis with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The number of nucleated cells in the marrow graft/kg body weight of the recipient had no relation with the rapidity of engraftment or with the occurrence and severity of GvHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The number of hematopoietic progenitor cells (CFUc)/kg had a weak, but significant, correlation with both the number of neutrophils at day 30 post BMT and with the day at which the reticulocytes passed the 10% level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The number of T cells/kg did not show any correlation with either the occurrence or the severity of GvHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our data show that the concentration of hematopoietic progenitor cells in the graft correlates with the rapidity of engraftment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, within the range of numbers of T cells infused in this study, no correlation is present between T cells in the graft and GvHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, nearly complete <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of marrow grafts of T cells is probably necessary to effectively decrease the incidence of GvHD </plain></SENT>
