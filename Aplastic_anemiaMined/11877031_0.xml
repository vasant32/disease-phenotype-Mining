<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The immune-mediated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> mice model was induced by irradiation and half-matched allogeneic lymphocytes transfusion (ALT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mice were divided into 3 groups: the irradiation alone control group, the irradiation + ALT group (AA group) and the irradiation + ALT + <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3699">cimetidine</z:chebi> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3699">cimetidine</z:chebi> group, each mouse was intraperitoneally injected <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3699">cimetidine</z:chebi> at different doses once a day for 8 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On day 14, the bone marrow histology was examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 0.5 mg, 1.0 mg and 2.0 mg x (10g)(-1) x d(-1) <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3699">cimetidine</z:chebi> groups, the percentages of hematopoietic tissue volume in bone marrow were (46.58 +/- 20.41)%, (51.88 +/- 24.94)% and (59.12 +/- 32.48)%, respectively, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> much higher than that in AA group [(19.99 +/- 10.98)%, P &lt; 0.01], but were not different from that in irradiated control group [(53.81 +/- 31.72)%, P &gt; 0.05] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The development of immune-mediated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> in irradiated mice by half-matched allogeneic lymphocytes transfusion was blocked by H(2) receptor <z:chebi fb="68" ids="48706">antagonist</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3699">cimetidine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
