<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-seven children aged 2 to 16 years (median 11 years) received a BMT from an HLA identical sibling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Conditioning consisted in irradiation (total, nodal or thoraco-abdominal) plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (120-200 mg/kg) in 15 patients and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> alone (200 mg/kg) in the rest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Prophylaxis for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) was <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> in most patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twenty-four children achieved the bone marrow graft at a median of 18 days (neutrophils) and 21 days (platelets) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two patients failed engraftment and 1 had a late graft rejection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three patients developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD grades 3-4 and six <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD, which was extensive in 4 of them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients/71%) are alive and disease-free at a median follow-up of 110 months and the estimated disease free survival at 6 years is 67% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm that allogeneic bone marrow transplantation from an HLA identical sibling is the best treatment modality for children with SAAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> GVHD associated with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> and graft rejection were responsible for treatment failures </plain></SENT>
