<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The association of antithymocyte globulin (ATG) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (CY) is the most frequently used conditioning regimen for this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed this retrospective study in order to compare the outcomes of HLA-matched sibling donor AHSCT in 41 patients with SAA receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> plus ATG (ATG-CY, N = 17) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi> (BU-CY, N = 24) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The substitution of BU for ATG was motivated by the high cost of ATG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in the clinical features between the two groups, including age, gender, cytomegalovirus status, ABO match, interval between diagnosis and transplant, and number of total nucleated cells infused </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No differences were observed in the time to neutrophil and platelet engraftment, or in the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948441" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="VOD">veno-occlusive disease</z:e> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, there was a higher risk of mucositis in the BU-CY group (71 vs 24%, P = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There were no differences in the incidence of neutrophil and platelet engraftment, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e>, and transplant-related mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was a higher incidence of late rejection in the ATG-CY group (41 vs 4%, P = 0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although the ATG-CY group had a longer follow-up (101 months) than the BU-CY group (67 months, P = 0.04), overall survival was similar between the groups (69 vs 58%, respectively, P = 0.32) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the association BU-CY is a feasible option to the conventional ATG-CY regimen in this population </plain></SENT>
