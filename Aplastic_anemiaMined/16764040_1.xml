<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The bone marrow tissues were obtained by trephine biopsy from 272 patients, and then put on the slides to make the imprints </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The imprints was stained by Wright-Giemsa method, and the bone marrow smears and imprints were examined simultaneously according to the bone marrow cellularity criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULT: In bone marrow cellularity, four grades (distinct decrease, extreme decrease, distinct increase, and extreme increase) were significantly higher in bone marrow imprints than those in bone marrow smears (P &lt;0.05), but there was no significantly differences between bone marrow imprints and sections (P &gt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using bone marrow sections as standard, in cellularily decreasing samples, the consistent rate of bone marrow imprints and smears were both high (84.4% and 97.9%), in the group of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and increased cellularity, the consistent rate of the bone marrow imprints (84.4% and 97.7%) was significantly higher than that in smears (60% and 64%, P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity, specificity, Youden index, positive predictive value and positive likelihood rate of bone marrow imprints were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> higher than those of the smears </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using the bone marrow sections as gold standard, in 124 cases with decreased cellularity in smears, the positive diagnosis rate for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and dyshaematopoiesis based on bone marrow imprints was 37.1% with a false positive rate of 7.3% which was lower than that of the bone marrow smears (false positive rate of 29.8%, P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: To evaluate bone marrow cellularity, bone marrow imprint is better than bone marrow smear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The combination of the two examinations can make the diagnosis more convenient and quicker </plain></SENT>
