<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Strict definition criteria were used, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> data and bone marrow specimens were reviewed by a panel of experienced hematologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Complete ascertainment of cases was attempted by establishing a telephone network including <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> relevant hospitals in the study areas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> was estimated to be less than three per million per year, a figure lower than previously reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The most likely explanation for the differences among studies is variation in diagnostic criteria, which might lead to an overestimation of the incidence in some previous studies </plain></SENT>
