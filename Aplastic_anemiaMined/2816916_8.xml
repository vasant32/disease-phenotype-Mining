<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 55-year-old white woman presented in July 1984 with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> refractory to anti-thymocyte globulin, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="4315">danazol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In December 1984, oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> therapy was begun, and a partial remission was achieved with persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> and transfusion independence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> dosage was tapered and then stopped in May 1986 when the platelet count was 35,000/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In October 1986 the platelet count was only 16,000/L, and the bone marrow showed evidence of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>; cytogenetic analysis revealed deletion of the long arm of chromosome 13 (previous cytogenetic findings had been <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> therapy was resumed, platelet count promptly increased to 36,000/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A subsequent attempt to taper the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> dosage resulted in a decreased platelet count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The platelet count responded to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> again and was maintained at 54,000/L and higher with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> therapy at only 25 mg/day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This information suggests that, despite the development of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, immune mechanisms were still operative in the pathogenesis of our patient's <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Immune modulation may have an important role in preventing progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> to more severe forms or to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
