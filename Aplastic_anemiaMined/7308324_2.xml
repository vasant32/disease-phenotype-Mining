<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To find out whether the preparations of anti-lymphocyte or anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG), successfully used in our center for the treatment of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, were stimulatory for hematopoietic precursor cells, we studied the effect on CFUC in 30 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although in 2 out of 30 cases stimulation was observed, the overall result for both the horse anti-lymphocyte globulin and the rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin was dose-dependent and complement-dependent inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Neither in the absence, nor in the presence of complement was there any indication of consistent stimulation of CFUC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When bone marrow was depleted of E-rosette forming cells, the incubation of the depleted fraction with ATG did not result in stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incubation of the E-rosette positive fraction with ATG, followed by the addition of these treated cells to untreated E-rosette depleted cells was equally ineffective in giving any stimulation of CFUC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that the effect of ATG in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> is not due to direct stimulation of hematopoietic precursor cells </plain></SENT>
