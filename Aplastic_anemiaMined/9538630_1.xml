<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To quantitate <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and Fas antigen expression of T lymphocytes by activation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) and compare with that of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls and completely-recovered AA, and to investigate the apoptotic sensitivity to anti-fas antibody of activated T lymphocytes in AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We studied the expression of Fas antigen on fresh T lymphocytes of twenty patients with AA [13 newly diagnosed, 7 recorvered AA after immunosuppressive therapy (IST)], and investigated the activation-induced cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (AICD) and Fas expression by activation [interleukin-2 (200 U/ml) and phytohemagglutinin (50 micrograms/ml)] in 5 newly-diagnosed AA, 5 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls and 5 AA in complete response (CR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Apoptotic sensitivity to anti-Fas antibody was assessed by the time-course kinetics of induction of cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> by anti-Fas antibody (500 ng/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no significant difference of Fas antigen expression on freshly-isolated T lymphocytes among newly-diagnosed severe AA, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls and patients with AA in CR after IST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls, T lymphocytes <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> was greatly increased at 3 days of activation, and Fas antigen expression on T lymphocytes was increased above baseline at day 1 of activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, in newly-diagnosed AA, T lymphocytes showed delayed cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, which correlated with a slowed increase of Fas antigen expression by activation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Also, anti-Fas antibody sensitivity of activated T lymphocytes was decreased in newly-diagnosed AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In completely recovered AA, these abnormal AICD and Fas antigen expressions by activation were recovered to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Abnormal AICD plays a role in the immune pathophysiology of AA, and defective Fas system is involved in this process </plain></SENT>
