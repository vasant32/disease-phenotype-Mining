<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor was administered to eight patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> in an attempt to restore adequate hematopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Profound decreases in serum cholesterol concentrations were observed during GM-CSF therapy that were not dependent on changes in the patients' peripheral blood cell counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum cholesterol levels decreased by an average of 37% during treatment, reaching levels of less than 4.40 mmol/L in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum cholesterol concentrations returned to baseline in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients after discontinuation of GM-CSF therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treatment with GM-CSF prominently alters cholesterol homeostasis in vivo, although the mechanism of this effect is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that GM-CSF may be potentially useful in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003124'>hypercholesterolemia</z:hpo> and, possibly, in the prevention and treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002621'>atherosclerosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
