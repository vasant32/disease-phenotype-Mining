<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In this study we have analyzed the activity of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">Cyclosporin A</z:chebi> (CsA) on the "in vitro" production of TNF and IL-3/GM-CSF as a preliminary basis for explaining the successful use of CsA in aplastic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thus, 73 T cell clones, obtained by a limiting dilution technique from the peripheral blood and bone marrow of 3 patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (SAA), were studied for TNF and IL-3/GM-CSF production as induced by stimulation with 1% PHA plus 1 ng/ml <z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Lymphokines obtained in this manner were then tested by biological assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twelve out of the initial 73 T cell clones were selected for the production of a large quantity of IL-3/GM-CSF and/or TNF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With these clones we studied the ability of CsA to inhibit TNF and IL-3/GM-CSF production, which was stimulated with specific monoclonal antibodies directed against the CD2 and CD3 surface antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>TNF and IL-3/GM-CSF production displayed a different sensitivity to CsA inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In fact, at 400 ng/ml CsA a residual production of IL-3/GM-CSF was present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> clones tested (CD3: 21.8% and CD2: 14.4% of the maximal IL-3/GM-CSF activity), while secretion of TNF was virtually abrogated at 100 ng/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the mean ID50 for TNF production was significantly lower than that of IL-3/GM-CSF (CD2: p = 0.028, CD3: p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Using specific anti-IL-3 and anti-GM-CSF monoclonal antibodies, we showed that only GM-CSF, and not IL-3, was resistant to CsA inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, these results may represent a possible explanation of the successful use of CsA in the treatment of some patients with SAA </plain></SENT>
