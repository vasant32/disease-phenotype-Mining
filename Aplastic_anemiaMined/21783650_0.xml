<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The predictable toxicity is relatively easy to reproduce with in vitro models, although they may not work for drugs that require bioactivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is very unlikely that idiosyncratic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">blood dyscrasias</z:e> can be modeled in vitro, although some drugs (or their reactive metabolites) that cause idiosyncratic reaction are toxic to bone marrow cells in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although the mechanisms of idiosyncratic reactions are poorly understood, there is evidence that most are due to reactive metabolites and some are immune-mediated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore screening drugs for their bioactivation by myeloperoxidase, the major oxidative enzyme in bone marrow, may provide some measure of the risk that a drug will cause <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">blood dyscrasias</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Several examples of drug-induced idiosyncratic <z:mp ids='MP_0000334'>agranulocytosis</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> are presented, but better in vivo models are clearly needed to gain a clearer understanding of these adverse reactions </plain></SENT>
