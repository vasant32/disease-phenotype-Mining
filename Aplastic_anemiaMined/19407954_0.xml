<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To study the therapeutic effect of combined therapy with Chinese drugs and immuno-suppressors, mainly anti-lymphocyte globulin/anti-thymus globulin (ALG/ATG), for the treatment of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (SAA), the efficacy associated factors and adverse effects as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 65 patients with SAA treated by combined therapy which was supplemented with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi>, hematopoietic growth factor, etc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 57 patients followed-up, 26 (45.6%) were basically cured, 15 (26.3%) remitted, and 8 (14.0%) improved markedly, the total effective rate being 85.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By separately comparing with a single item of clinical data, it was shown that the therapeutic effectiveness was correlated, to a certain extent, with age, illness duration, neutrophil count, and bone marrow proliferation in patients before treatment, as well as with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> that occurred in the follow-up period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It was obviously higher in patients with peripheral neutrophil count &gt; 0.5 x 10 10(9)/L (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Various degrees of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036830" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">serum sickness</z:e>-like reactions occurred in the treatment of 36 patients, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> in 36 (63.2%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000988'>skin rash</z:hpo> in 8 (14.0%), and musculoskeletal pain in 5 (8.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The therapeutic effect of combined therapy with Chinese drugs and ALG/ATG in treating SAA could be affirmed, showing some superiority as compared with Western medicine alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patients' age, duration of illness, neutrophil count, and bone marrow proliferation before treatment, and degree of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> that occurred could affect the therapeutic efficacy to a certain extent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Adverse reactions resulting from the combined therapy are less, showing the toxicity reducing and effect enhancing action of Chinese drugs </plain></SENT>
