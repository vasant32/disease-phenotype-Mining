<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The supernatants were removed the next morning, the cells harvested and washed, and both tested for CFU-c suppression on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> marrow cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">Cyclosporin A</z:chebi> (CyA) was added to this system to test whether it could abrogate or prevent the generation of suppressor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CyA was incubated with T cells, at a concentration of 0.1 microgram/ml, for 30 min at 37 degrees C and then washed away, in two different assays: (a) before T cells were incubated overnight in culture medium with or without PWM, or (b) after T cells had been kept overnight in culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results of this study indicate that CyA can prevent the generation of CFU-c suppressor T cells if preincubated with both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or SAA T cells prior to in vitro priming, whereas it cannot abrogate the suppressor activity of primed T cells </plain></SENT>
