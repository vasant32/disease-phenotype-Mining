<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>Aplastic anemia</z:hpo> is diagnosed on the basis of laboratory tests and bone marrow biopsy findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Biopsy is of fundamental importance for bone marrow assessment, though not representative of the rest of the marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thanks to its exclusive capabilities in the direct visualization of bone marrow, MRI is a noninvasive and relatively rapid method for bone marrow study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The authors report their experience in 3 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> patients examined also with MRI at presentation and after marrow transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The dorsolumbar spine was studied with sagittal SE T1-weighted and STIR sequences, while pelvic bones were investigated only with SE T1-weighted sequences in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two of them were also examined with sagittal scans of the dorsolumbar spine using the chemical shift fat suppression technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three patients, SE T1-weighted images at presentation showed fatty bone marrow infiltration, also confirmed on fat suppression images, and, after transplantation, progressive bone marrow repopulation, with the typical "band" pattern in vertebral marrow </plain></SENT>
