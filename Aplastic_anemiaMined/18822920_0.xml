<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Sixty-eight patients with CAA were assigned to two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The 35 patients in the test group were treated with BSG and the 33 in the control group by Zaizhang Shengxue Tablet </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Levels of Fn and FL were determined before and after 6-month treatment by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The clinical effective rate in the test group was 74.3% (26/35 cases), and that in the control group 48.5% (16/33 cases), the difference between the two groups was significant (P &lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the test group, patients of yang-deficiency type showed an effect superior to that of yin-deficiency type, 93.8% (15/16 cases) vs 57.9% (11/19 cases, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>High expression manners of Fn and FL were shown in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> CAA patients, the high expressions of both were lowered to some extent after treatment, but the improvement in the test group was better than that in the control group (P &lt;0.05), and the deviation was more liable to be corrected in patients of Shen-yang deficiency type than that in patients of Shen-yin deficiency type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: BSG is better than Zaizhang Shengxue Tablet in clinical effect and improving the CAA related adhesive molecules, Fn and FL, suggesting that it is an effective remedy for preventing and treating CAA, with its curative effect more significant on patients of yang-deficiency type than that on patients of yin-deficiency type </plain></SENT>
