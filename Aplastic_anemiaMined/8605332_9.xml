<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated the effects of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, interleukin-3, stem cell factor, interleukin-6, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) alone, and in combination, on the clonogenic potential of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMC and CD34+ cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AA BMMC consistently produced a significantly lower absolute number of colonies than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, but, when account was taken of the reduced proportion of CD34+ cells in AA BM, there was no significant difference in terms of cloning efficiency (CE) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, when removed from the influence of accessory cells, the CE of AA CD34+ cells decreased significantly more than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, indicating a defect in their function, either in terms of dependence on accessory cell-derived factors or susceptibility to cell damage when sorted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the factors studied, G-CSF had the most significant effect on the response of CD34+ cells from both groups when removed from their accessory cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This was particularly true for AA CD34+ cells, whose response to cytokine stimuli containing G-CSF enabled them to match the response of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CD34+ cells </plain></SENT>
