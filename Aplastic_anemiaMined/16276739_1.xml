<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This is a retrospective investigation of the factors that affect the efficacy of antibiotic treatment of febrile <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> (FN) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The subjects consisted of 98 cases that developed FN during their hospitalization in this department and received antibiotics as a first-line treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Parameters evaluated were age, gender, with or without administration of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), with or without hematopoietic transplantation, the number of antibiotics, the type of antibiotics, the highest level of C-reactive protein (CRP), with or without antifungal prophylaxis, the duration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo>, and the number of neutrophils before and after the administration of antibiotics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Logistic analysis was used for statistical evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With univariate analysis, significant clinical efficacy was observed with the use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46765">carbapenems</z:chebi> (p = 0.0009, Odds; 4.58) when the number of neutrophils was not less than 500/microL (P &lt; 0.0001, Odds: 14.1) after administration of antibiotics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, even when multivariate analysis was performed, significant clinical efficacy was observed independently in the use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46765">carbapenems</z:chebi> (P = 0.02, Odds: 3.73) and when the number of neutrophils was not less than 500/microL (P &lt; 0.0001, Odds: 10.4) after administration of antibiotics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In this investigation, as a first-line treatment of FN, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46765">carbapenem</z:chebi> antibiotic is recommended as a primary choice, when the number of neutrophils was expected to decrease after administration </plain></SENT>
