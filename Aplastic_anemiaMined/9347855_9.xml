<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Auxiliary orthotopic liver transplantation (AOLT) was investigated as a bridge to native liver recovery in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004448'>fulminant hepatic failure</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="30480">FHF</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In the last 5 years seven patients with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30480">FHF</z:chebi> were treated with AOLT at our institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Five patients underwent resection of the native left lobe and orthotopic replacement with a donor left lobe (n = 3) or left lateral segment (n = 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two patients underwent left trisegmentectomy and whole liver auxiliary grafting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Conventional immunosuppression was used in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One patient had poor initial graft function and required retransplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Native liver function returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in the six other patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Immunosuppression was gradually tapered and completely discontinued in three patients, allowing for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> of the allograft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The allograft was removed in the other four patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Despite evidence of native <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1318485" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver regeneration</z:e>, two patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> died after allograft removal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Four patients are alive at a mean follow-up of 3.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: AOLT is technically feasible, rapidly restores liver function, and should be considered an important alternative to standard orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) in the treatment of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30480">FHF </z:chebi></plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>AOLT has the advantage that patients transplanted for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30480">FHF</z:chebi> are not committed to lifelong immunosuppression with its attendant risks </plain></SENT>
