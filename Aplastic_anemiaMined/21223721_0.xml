<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>Monosomy</z:mp> 7 (-7) in 81 AA patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> karyotype at diagnosis and 46 AA treated with immunosuppressive therapy (IST) and more than 6 months of recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhuG-CSF) were detected by interphase- fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There were 5.4% - 7.6% of -7 cells in 11 (13.6%) of 81 patients at diagnosis, the survival and response rate to IST in -7 positive patients did not differ significantly from that in -7 negative patients (P = 0.481, 0.865); -7 cells disappeared after IST in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the 11 patients including 5 received long-term rhuG-CSF therapy, and none of them evolved to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) at a median follow-up of 44 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serial assessments of -7 clones were performed in 46 patients, none of whom detected -7 clones 3-6 months after IST, but -7 recurrence in 5 patients 12 - 15 months after IST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At a median follow-up of 48 months, FISH identified 6 patients with -7 clones while the conventional cytogenetic analysis (CCA) recognized in 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the first demonstration of -7 by FISH was 3 - 18 months earlier than that by CCA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the 6 patients with FISH detected -7 evolved to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> with -7 and four of them were retrospectively analysed for in samples at -7 diagnosis of AA, but none of them was positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>Monosomy</z:mp> 7 exists in a part of AA patients, but the preexisting -7 cells seems neither associated with fatality nor evolvation to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>rhuG-CSF might facilitate the expansion of -7 clones; It is necessary to monitor -7 in AA, especially when received long-term rhuG-CSF therapy </plain></SENT>
