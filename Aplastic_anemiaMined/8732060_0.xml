<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A sandwich enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA) was established for measuring serum transferrin receptor (sTfR) by using monoclonal antibody OKT9 and monospecific polyclonal antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This method is simple, specific and sensitive and has a good accuracy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The measurement of sTfR showed that the level of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> children was 4.54 +/- 1.08 mg/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were increased levels of sTfR in patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001891'>iron deficiency anemia</z:hpo> and those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001878'>hemolytic anemia</z:hpo> (13.92 +/- 4.45 mg/L and 9.94 +/- 3.22 mg/L, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, the level was decreased (2.06 +/- 0.82 mg/L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that the sTfR measurement has a differential significance for diagnoses of various <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
