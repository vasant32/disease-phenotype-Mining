<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We characterized the IL-6/-174, TNF-alpha/-308, IL-10/-1082, IFN-gamma/+874, TGFbeta1/-509 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP's) and the IL1-RA second intron variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) alleles in 73 patients with AA and compared the frequency of genotypes to established control populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that some patients with acquired AA have polymorphisms which are linked to high production of proinflammatory cytokines, particularly TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma </plain></SENT>
