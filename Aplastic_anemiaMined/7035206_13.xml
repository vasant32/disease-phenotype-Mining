<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirteen of these patients also received an infusion of HLA one haplotype-identical bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Toxicity of ATG included <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, chills, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015230" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rash</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002829'>arthralgias</z:hpo> and elevated liver function tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Platelet transfusion requirements increased during therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients died 0.2-9.4 months after beginning ATG therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>None of the 11 patients had any improvement in hematologic status prior to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The eight surviving patients have been followed for at least 24 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Six had evidence of hematologic improvement within 6-8 weeks after ATG therapy and are transfusion-independent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The other two patients improved more than one year after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Survival after ATG therapy did not correlate with the presumed etiology of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath>, duration of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath>, patient age or sex, prior therapy, or admission granulocyte count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Addition of bone marrow infusion to ATG treatment also did not affect survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrated the necessity for a randomized trial of ATG versus supportive care alone for the treatment of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
