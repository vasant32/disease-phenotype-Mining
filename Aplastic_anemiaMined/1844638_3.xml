<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Medical records were studied of patients with diagnoses of either <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ICD</z:e>-9 038 (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_681'>septicemia</z:mpath>), or 204-208 (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo>), or 284 (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>), or 289 (other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diseases of the blood and blood-forming organs</z:e>) in the claims sent in by medical care institutions throughout the country to the Korea Medical Insurance Corporation (KMIC) during the period from January 1, 1986 to December 31, 1987 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These records were abstracted in order to identify and confirm new cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> among the beneficiaries of KMIC, which covers about 10% of the whole Korean population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using these data from the KMIC, the incidence rates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> among Koreans were estimated as of July 1st, 1986 to June 30, 1987 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The crude incidence rate of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> among Koreans is estimated to be 3.45 (95% CI; 0.77-9.55) and 2.29 (95% CI; 0.28-7.81) per 100,000 in males and females, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cumulative rate for the age span 0-64 is 0.25% in males and 0.18% in females, and for the age span 0-74, 0.35% in males and 0.23% in females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The adjusted rates for the standard world population are 3.90 and 2.48 per 100,000 in males and females, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The relative frequencies by type are 51.5% for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>, 21.6% for ALL, 20.2% for <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>, and only 1.5% for CLL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The incidence patterns of various types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, of which this is the first report in Korea, are analyzed and presented.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
