<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Sera from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004859'>amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> contain an activity that stimulates megakaryocyte colony formation in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have assayed this megakaryocyte colony-stimulating activity (Meg-CSA) in sera of four patients receiving intensive antileukemic chemotherapy to determine whether the appearance of Meg-CSA is a physiologic response to the suppression of megakaryocytopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three of the four patients were receiving consolidation or late intensification therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> myoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>) in remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The fourth was receiving induction therapy for de novo <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> or part of four chemotherapeutic cycles, serial Meg-CSA levels were assessed and correlated with the corresponding peripheral platelet counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> courses of cytotoxic chemotherapy resulted in increases in serum Meg-CSA comparable to activity levels present in sera from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two of the three patients studied during the early postchemotherapy interval manifested initial serum Meg-CSA elevations seven days before their thrombocytopenic nadirs when platelet counts were still between 100,000/mm3 and 140,000/mm3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow recovery from chemotherapy was characterized by a decrease in serum Meg-CSA to pretherapy levels that occurred concurrently with the rise in platelet count to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These observations support the hypothesis that Meg-CSA is a physiologic humoral regulator of megakaryocytopoiesis elaborated in response to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of either bone marrow megakaryocytes or megakaryocyte progenitor cells </plain></SENT>
