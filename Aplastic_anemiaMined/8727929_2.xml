<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The light emitted from the in situ-hybridized probe was analyzed and measured by a high-performance luminograph connected to an optical microscope and to a personal computer for the quantification of the <z:chebi fb="23" ids="30212">photon</z:chebi> fluxes from the single cells and for image analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The chemiluminescence in situ hybridization was applied to bone marrow cell smears of patients with aplastic crisis or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001908'>hypoplastic anemia</z:hpo>, who had been previously tested by in situ hybridization with colorimetric detection, dot blot hybridization, and nested PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The chemiluminescent assay provided an objective estimation of the data, proved specific, and showed an increased sensitivity in detecting B19 DNA compared with in situ hybridization with colorimetric detection </plain></SENT>
