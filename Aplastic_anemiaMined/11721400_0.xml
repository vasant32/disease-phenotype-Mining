<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: CD34 positive bone marrow cells from 10 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>(CAA), 5 severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>(SAA) patients and 5 healthy subjects were detected with immunoflurescence assay, enriched by Panning way, and then cultured in vitro for CFU-GM, BFU-E and CFU-E in the presence of recombinant HGFs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CD34 positive rates of the bone marrow mononuclear cells(MNC) of CAA, SAA and control groups were (1.05 +/- 0.51)%, (0.70 +/- 0.37)% and (1.27 +/- 0.45)%, respectively, and there was no difference among them (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After being enriched, CD34 positive cells in MNC of CAA, SAA and control groups increased to a similar level(P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the presence of G-CSF or GM-CSF, the enriched CD34 positive MNC of CAA and SAA patients formed similar CFU-GM number to those of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The numbers of BFU-E and CFU-E formed from the enriched CD34 positive MNC of CAA and SAA patients were also the same as that of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control groups under the stimulation of erythropoietin and interleukin-3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Stem cell factor could cooperate with G-CSF, GM-CSF, and erythropoietin significantly increasing the numbers of CFU-GM, BFU-E and CFU-E of CAA, SAA and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control's enriched CD34 positive MNC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The bone marrow CD34 positive cells from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> patients appears to be <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in percentages and in in vitro proliferation/differentiation capacities </plain></SENT>
