<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results were compared to those obtained from fat cells grown in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thin-layer chromatography (t.l.c) revealed that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triacylglycerols</z:chebi> were the major component of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1368107" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aplastic marrow</z:e> fat cells and of fat cells in culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Analysis by gas-liquid chromatography (g.l.c) of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17855">triacylglycerols</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="18035">diacylglycerols</z:chebi>, and nonesterified fatty acids detected minor differences between fat cells from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1368107" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aplastic marrow</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although there were no statistically significant differences in the proportions of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="26607">saturated fatty acids</z:chebi> and their unsaturated analogues, the relative amounts of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="28661">gamma-linolenic acid</z:chebi> were increased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and those of linoleic and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27781">myristoleic acids</z:chebi> were reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, fat cells obtained from in vitro cultures contained a much higher proportion of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="27208">unsaturated fatty acids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that there is no marked abnormality in the composition of bone marrow fat cells in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, but that minor differences can be detected; the fatty acid composition of bone marrow fat cells is not reproduced in vitro </plain></SENT>
