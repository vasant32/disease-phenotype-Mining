<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To investigate the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA), the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of CD34+ cells was assayed with annexin V-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi> 24 hr and 48 hr after incubation with the serum of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (n = 10), patients with non severe AA (NSAA, n = 13) and severe AA (SAA, n = 10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The CD34+ progenitors from the bone marrow of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> donors contained a significantly greater proportion of apoptotic cells after incubation with serum from SAA patients than that incubated with serum from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls and NSAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the percent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of CD34+ cells after 24 hr incubation with serum from NSAA was slightly higher than that of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This appears to be related to clinical severity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No significant difference was found in the percent <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of CD34+ cells between incubation for 24 hr and 48 hr with the same serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To further explore the mechanism of <z:mp ids='MP_0006042'>increased apoptosis</z:mp> induced by the serum of AA patients, the expression of the Fas receptor was measured after incubation with serum from the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls and AA patients using flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After incubation with serum from the AA patients, the Fas receptor was overexpressed, correlating with the <z:mp ids='MP_0006042'>increased apoptosis</z:mp> induced by the same serum from AA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, the induction of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and Fas expression on CD34+ cells by serum from the SAA patients was blocked partly by preincubation of the serum with anti-gamma-IFN neutralizing MoAb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These findings suggested that some aberrant components of the serum in the AA patients, which was confirmed partly to be gamma-IFN, can induce CD34+ progenitors <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> through the Fas signaling pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This may contribute to understanding the decreased number of stem cells characteristic of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
