<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Resultant decreases in oral fat intake coincident with fat-free parenteral nutrition may predispose patients to essential fatty acid (EFA) deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Determinations were made of the fatty acid composition of plasma total <z:chebi fb="23" ids="18059">lipid</z:chebi> from 20 bone marrow transplant patients on admission, at the time of bone marrow transplant, and on days 7, 14, 30, and 60 post-bone marrow transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients ate ad libitum but with little appetite and received fat-free parenteral nutrition interrupted for numerous blood product and drug infusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Abnormal EFA status was manifest (20:3 omega 9/20:4 ratio greater than 0.2) in 12 of 20 patients during the course of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Plasma EFA status was consistently correlated with oral fat intake but not with sex, age, percentage of ideal body weight, or amount of plasma infused </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This suggests that dietary fat was absorbed limiting the severity of EFA deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interruptions of <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> infusion averaging only about 2 hours/day, also may have helped moderate the deficiency </plain></SENT>
