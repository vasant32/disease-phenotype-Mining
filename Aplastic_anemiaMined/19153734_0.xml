<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent reports have shown that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001638'>cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> caused by <z:mp ids='MP_0005638'>hemochromatosis</z:mp> in severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> is reversible after reduced-intensity allogeneic stem-cell transplantation (RIST) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We comprehensively evaluated cardiac and autonomic nerve function to determine whether cardiac dysfunction due to causes other than <z:mp ids='MP_0005638'>hemochromatosis</z:mp> is attenuated after RIST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In five patients with cardiac dysfunction before transplant, we analyzed the changes in cardiac and autonomic nerve function after transplant, using electrocardiography (ECG), echocardiography, radionuclide angiography (<z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>), serum markers, and heart rate variability (HRV), before and up to 100 days after transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was no significant improvement in cardiac function in any patient and no significant alteration in ECG, echocardiogram, <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>, or serum markers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, on time-domain analysis of HRV, the SD of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-to-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> RR intervals (SDNN) and the coefficient of variation of the RR interval (CVRR) decreased significantly 30 and 60 days after transplant (P = 0.04 and 0.01, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similarly, on frequency-domain analysis of HRV, low and high frequency power (LF and HF) significantly and temporarily decreased (P = 0.003 and 0.03, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Notably, in one patient who had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001635'>heart failure</z:hpo> after transplantation, the values of SDNN, CVRR, r-MSSD, LF, and HF at 30 and 60 days after transplantation were the lowest of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, this study suggests that (a) RIST is well-tolerated in patients with cardiac dysfunction, but we cannot expect improvement in cardiac dysfunction due to causes other than <z:mp ids='MP_0005638'>hemochromatosis</z:mp>; and (b) monitoring HRV may be useful in predicting cardiac events after RIST </plain></SENT>
