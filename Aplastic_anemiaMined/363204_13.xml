<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Antibody-dependent sensitization was detected in 3 patients, antibody-independent cellular sensitization in 11, and both in 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fourteen sensitized patients were transplanted after initial multiagent immunosuppression consisting of rabbit anti-human thymocyte serum, procarbazine, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, eleven with a <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>-positive donor and three with a <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>-negative donor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Engraftment was achieved in each of 13 patients who were evaluable, and only 2 ultimately rejected their marrow grafts, 1 with subsequent return of his own marrow function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five patients without evidence in vitro of sensitization were transplanted after immunosuppression with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> alone; none of these rejected their grafts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These studies show that sensitized bone marrow transplant recipients can be successfully transplanted after optimal donor selection and multiagent immunosuppression </plain></SENT>
