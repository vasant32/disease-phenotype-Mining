<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In one patient, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> levels increased from 6.4 g/dL to 11.3 g/dL after 36 weeks of SCF/G-CSF treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thereafter, the platelet count (24.0 x 10(9)/L) began to improve without the therapy, and as of week 272, the platelet count was 125.0 x 10(9)/L with a leukocyte count of 8.4 x 10(9)/L and a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> level of 12.9 g/dL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the other patient, more than 3 years of SCF/G-CSF treatment ameliorated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> levels and platelet counts from 5.8 g/dL to 15.9 g/dL and 8.0 x 10(9)/L to 50.0 x 10(9)/L, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After cessation of SCF/G-CSF treatment, the positive response was sustained, and the platelet count improved further to 71.0 x 10(9)/L as of week 242 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest the clinical benefit of SCF/G-CSF administration to patients with refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
