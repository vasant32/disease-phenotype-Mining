<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study was to analyze the efficacy and toxicity of chemotherapy combined with surgery and/or radiotherapy on <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GCTs</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 23 patients with <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GCTs</z:e> were treated in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Center of Sun Yat-sen University from May 2002 to Jun </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median age at diagnosis was 16 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and/or beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-HCG) levels were elevated in 19 patients (82.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were treated with chemotherapy of PEB regimen combined with surgery and/or radiotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>PEB regimen was administered every 3 weeks with 20 mg/m(2) <z:chebi fb="2" ids="27899">cisplatin</z:chebi> (DDP) at Days 1-5 or 80-100 mg/m(2) at Day 1, 60-100 mg/m(2) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">etoposide</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4911">VP-16</z:chebi>) or teniposide (VM-26) at Days 1-5, 10 mg/m(2) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="3139">bleomycin</z:chebi> (BLM) at Days 1 and 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 23 patients, 17 newly diagnosed patients received induction chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy or surgery/radiotherapy followed by adjuvant chemotherapy; 6 recurrent patients received salvage chemotherapy, of which 3 patients with disseminated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> received salvage chemotherapy followed by craniospinal irradiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The 23 patients completed a total of 61 cycles of PEB regimen with a median of 3 cycles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Chemotherapy alone gained a response rate of 87.0% and a complete remission rate of 30.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Craniospinal irradiation was performed in 14 patients and focal irradiation in 8 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>One patient did not receive irradiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Incomplete <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> resection or biopsy was performed in 13 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Fourteen patients (60.9%) were alive without evidence of diseases after combined modality treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up of 24 months, the 2-year survival rate was 67.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Main adverse events were late irradiation injury including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and hypothalamus syndrome (1 case), irradiation <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo> (1 case), and <z:mp ids='MP_0003348'>hypopituitarism</z:mp> (2 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The combined modality treatment including PEB regimen is highly effective in treating <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GCTs</z:e> patients, especially in the patients with elevated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> markers </plain></SENT>
