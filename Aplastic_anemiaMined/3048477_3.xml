<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied the efficacy of several conditioning regimens including a new immunosuppressive regimen--total lymphoid irradiation (TLI) plus conventional chemotherapy and total body irradiation (TBI)--in abrogating residual host T lymphocytes as assessed by their ability to grow in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 38 patients were evaluated, 29 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e>, six with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) and three with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002875" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">beta-thalassemia major</z:e> (TM), of whom 32 were transplanted with HLA-identical T cell-depleted allogeneic BM from sibling donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median observation period was 15 months (range 3-21) posttransplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) taken from each patient on the day of transplant were cultured with interleukin 2 (IL-2) + phytohemagglutinin + irradiated donors' PBMC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Survival of cells for less than 2 weeks in vitro without proliferation was observed in 20 of 29 cases with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> and was considered negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In this group only two <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (L) patients rejected the graft </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Limited cell growth (less than or equal to 3 weeks) was seen in four L patients, two of whom showed early graft failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Vigorous T cell growth (greater than 5 weeks, 62-96% CD4+ cells) was noted in eight cases (two L, four AA, two TM; none received TBI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In this group, sustained engraftment was observed in 7/7 patients who were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> (CSA) post grafting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Overall, we could demonstrate no clear correlation between graft failure and cell growth in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The proliferating cells exhibited considerable cytotoxic activity in vitro against several <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> cell lines and were susceptible to pharmacological doses of CSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The low incidence of continuous T cell proliferation in vitro in PBMC of L patients suggests that a combination of TLI, TBI and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (CY) is highly effective in abrogating the host T cells and subsequent graft rejection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Since a rather small number of patients was included in this study, further studies are needed to determine the possible value of the in vitro T cell proliferation assay as a means for predicting graft failure </plain></SENT>
