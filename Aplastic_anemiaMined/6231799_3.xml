<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Severe <z:mp ids='MP_0000223'>monocytopenia</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0010976'>B-lymphocytopenia</z:hpo> was detected in most patients, especially in those with diffuse lymphocyte infiltration in the bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>T-inducer (OKT4)/T-suppressor (OKT8) ratios were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean IgG level was significantly decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The frequency of specific antibodies to common viruses was comparable to that of healthy donors except for cytomegalovirus to which antibodies were less frequently found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The responding capacity in MLC was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> but patients' lymphocytes were often less stimulating than control lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Radioresistant suppressor cells were found in 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In vitro lymphocyte reactivity to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogens</z:chebi> and antigens was severely impaired, related to the numbers of monocytes present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When allogeneic monocytes were added, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi> responses could be restored </plain></SENT>
