<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There were 15 men and 12 women (median age 13 1/12 years, range 11/12 to 22 6/12 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>Aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (14 patients) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> nonlymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (eight patients) were the major reasons for bone marrow transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Pretransplant conditioning consisted of single-dose irradiation combined with high-dose, short-term chemotherapy in 23 patients, while four patients received a bone marrow transplantation without any radiation therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thyroid dysfunction occurred in 10 of 23 (43 percent) irradiated patients; <z:hpo ids='HP_0008223'>compensated hypothyroidism</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002925'>elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone levels</z:hpo> only) developed in eight subjects, and two patients had primary thyroid failure (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002925'>elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone levels</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000821'>low T4</z:hpo> index) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The abnormal thyroid studies were detected a median of 13 months after bone marrow transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The four subjects who underwent transplantation without radiation therapy have remained euthyroid (median follow-up two years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The only variable that appeared to correlate with the subsequent development of impaired thyroid function was the type of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> prophylaxis employed; the irradiated subjects treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> alone had a higher incidence of thyroid dysfunction compared to those treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> combined with antithymocyte globulin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> (eight of 12 versus two of 11, p less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The high incidence and subtle nature of impaired thyroid function following single-dose irradiation for bone marrow transplantation are discussed </plain></SENT>
