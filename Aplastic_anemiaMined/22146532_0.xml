<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Campath-1 H (alemtuzumab), a humanized monoclonal antibody to CD52 antigen, is thought to reduce GVHD incidence through in vivo T-cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Through the same mechanism it can potentially increase the risk of relapse by reducing the graft versus <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> effect and possibly increase the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> due to delayed immune recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A retrospective case analysis of 17 pediatric matched unrelated HSCTs done in our institution between January 2003 and June 2009 with Campath-1H as part of the pretransplant conditioning regimen was conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Grade I-II <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD was noted in 29.4% of the HSCTs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No patient developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> but one patient with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> engrafted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A relapse of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277554" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">primary disease</z:e> was noted in 35.3% of the transplants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Three patient <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> were due to relapse and 1 due to disseminated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0008049" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">varicella infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Overall survival was 100% and 94% at 100 days and 1 year, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our experience suggests Campath-1H used as part of pretransplant conditioning regimen in pediatric unrelated HSCTs effectively reduces the risk of serious GVHD with no apparent increase in life-threatening <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> or relapse compared with that reported with conventional regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Larger studies, with longer duration of follow-up, are required to further assess its role with regards to graft versus <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> effect and to establish if the decreased incidence of GVHD and infectious complications is sustained in larger cohorts </plain></SENT>
