<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The condition usually occurs sporadically or in a pattern consistent with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000007'>autosomal recessive inheritance</z:hpo>, although <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> transmission has been proposed in some kindreds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report the largest known kindred of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004810'>congenital hypoplastic anemia</z:hpo>, with at least 7 affected individuals over 3 generations, and propose that studies of this kindred may be useful for identifying the mechanism by which their genetic abnormality results in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004810'>congenital hypoplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Erythropoietic investigations on relatives show no inhibitors of erythropoiesis in serum, T-lymphocytes, or macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Their erythroid progenitor cells (CFU-E and BFU-E) were generally quantitatively <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, and were capable of rapid proliferation, as judged by cell-cycle shortening </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, their erythroid progenitors displayed a relative insensitivity to recombinant erythropoietin, and produced relatively few normoblasts per erythroid progenitor cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We propose that these and subsequent studies may be helpful in selecting candidate genes responsible for the molecular defect in this kindred </plain></SENT>
