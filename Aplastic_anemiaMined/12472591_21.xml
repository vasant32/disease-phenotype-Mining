<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Evidence from preliminary studies suggests that recombinant human glycosylated granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (lenograstim) increases the number and functionality of neutrophils in patients with severe aplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This randomized, parallel-group, multicentre study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of subcutaneous lenograstim during the first 12 weeks of standard immunosuppressive therapy in 102 patients with de novo severe aplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The addition of lenograstim to standard therapy resulted in an increase in the proportion of patients showing complete neutrophil response (83.0%vs 44.9%; P &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This was seen even among patients with very severe aplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> (69.2%vs 31.6%; P = 0.012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In patients receiving lenograstim, median time to complete neutrophil response was shorter (6.3 vs 16.1 weeks; P = 0.0001) and mean duration of first neutrophil response was longer (P = 0.0248) than in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At a median follow-up of 5 years, no difference was observed between the groups in term of survival, haematological response and occurrence of secondary <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> (one patient in each group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that lenograstim support of immunosuppressive therapy might be used for patients with severe aplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> as it significantly enhances neutrophil recovery but does not modify the overall response and survival </plain></SENT>
