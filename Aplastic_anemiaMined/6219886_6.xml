<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The remarkable feature of one case following autologous marrow recovery was the presence of unidirectional proliferative and cytotoxic responses of circulating host lymphocytes to marrow donor lymphocytes in mixed lymphocyte culture and cell-mediated lympholysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Presumably these responses were the result of in vivo sensitization to those non-HLA antigens for which donor and recipient differed </plain></SENT>
