<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="465284">Ganciclovir</z:chebi>-resistant clinical isolate, 93-1R, also showed cross-resistance against (s)-1-(3-hydroxy-2-phosphonylmethoxypropyl) <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi> (cidofovir) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Molecular analysis of plaque-cloned strains revealed that a single nucleotide substitution at 2160 (C to T) resulted in amino acid substitution at codon 501 from leucine to phenylalanine in the DNA polymerase gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This mutation at codon 501 was easily identified by means of AluI digestion of the selected PCR product </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The same mutation existed in the DNA fragment amplified from the patient's brain, suggesting that cross-resistant mutant 93-1R caused <z:hpo ids='HP_0002383'>encephalitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="465284">ganciclovir</z:chebi>-resistant 93-1R-3 replicated much faster and was released more efficiently into the culture medium than <z:chebi fb="0" ids="465284">ganciclovir</z:chebi>-sensitive 91-7S-1 </plain></SENT>
