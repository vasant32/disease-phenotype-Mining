<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To evaluate the efficacy of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> (CyA) at different stages of immunosuppressive therapy (IST) in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The efficacy of CyA was studied in 56 patients with AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The agent was orally given in an initial dose of 10 mg/kg as solution or capsules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Its daily dose during a treatment course varies with the serum CyA levels and clinical tolerance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CyA was used in 17 patients at the first stage of treatment, in 8 with recurrent AA, and in 31 after ineffective previous therapy (antilymphocytic globulin therapy--ALGT, splenectomy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Erythropoiesis was evaluated by the count of erythrokaryocytes and by relative <z:hpo ids='HP_0012132'>erythroid hyperplasia</z:hpo> of the bone marrow and by using erythrokaryocytic <z:chebi fb="61" ids="27565">PAS</z:chebi> reaction, by calculating the total count of sideroblasts and ringed sideroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A positive response was obtained in 41% of the patients with AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Its pattern depended on the severity of AA, on CyA use regimens, and treatment duration: when treatment with CyA lasted 6-12 months, its efficacy considerably increased (positive responses in severe AA and mild AA being in 64 and 94%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It has been found that high (over 6%) baseline bone marrow ringed sideroblasts in patients with AA may be regarded as a poor predictor in the context of the efficacy of this agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CyA is recommended for combined IST in patients with AA at the second stage of treatment (after antilymphocytic globulin administration) in order to perform long-term (12-month) immunosuppression by choosing the optimum dose on an individual basis and by continuously monitoring the quality of a response </plain></SENT>
