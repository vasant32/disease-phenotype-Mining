<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the c-MPL gene encoding for thrombopoietin receptor have been identified in the majority of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previous studies suggest a genotype-phenotype correlation wherein the severity of the disease depends on the type of mutation present and residual thrombopoietin receptor activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The present study describes the clinical and genetic findings on a series of 7 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CAMT</z:e>, 3 of them siblings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients were homozygous for 5 mutations in the c-MPL gene, including 3 unique ones: c.212+5G&gt;A, C76T, and G1162C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The clinical picture was variable; 1 patient who was homozygous for a nonsense mutation in exon 1 (C76T) developed infantile <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo>, whereas patients who were homozygous for a splice-site mutation (c.212+5G&gt;A) expressing both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and mutated transcripts had a milder clinical course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As previously suggested, c-MPL mutation analysis in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CAMT</z:e> patients helps to predict the clinical course and to provide optimal therapy </plain></SENT>
