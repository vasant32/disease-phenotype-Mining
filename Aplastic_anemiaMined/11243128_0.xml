<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-five cases of CAA were treated with triolandren (TLD) (15 cases) or TLD and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> (CsA) (30 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The response rate of TLD-CsA group (83.3%) was higher than that of TLD group (60.0%), furthermore, the recovery of bone marrow colony-forming cell (CFC) number of the responding patients was more complete and rapid in TLD-CsA group than in TLD group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow CFC number had no significant change of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> nonresponding patients in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The response rate of TLD-CsA was higher than that of TLD alone, and the recovery of bone marrow CFC number of the responding patients was more complete and rapid in TLD-CsA group </plain></SENT>
