<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Although high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> seems to achieve durable complete remission, there are still concerns about its too much early toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>So, we designed a clinical study to investigate the effects of high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>/ATG combined with cord blood infusion as first-line therapy for patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients and Method: Between January 2003 and September 2007, we treated 16 treatment-naive patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> with cord blood infusion after high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (50 mg/kg/d × 2) and rabbit antithymocyte globulin (3 mg/kg/d × 5) therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results: Although only one patient had durable full donor engraftment, 14 of the enrolled 16 patients had rapid autologous hematopoietic recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median recovery time for neutrophils and platelets was only 23 and 37 d after infusion of cord blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of the 15 responding patients, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients achieved treatment-free remission: nine patients met the criteria for a complete remission; six patients achieved a partial remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Conclusion: Infusion of cord blood after high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>/ATG resulted in a rapid autologous hematologic recovery and a high response rate in patients with treatment-naive patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These promising results merit further investigation and confirmation on a larger number of patients </plain></SENT>
