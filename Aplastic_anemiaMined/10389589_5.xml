<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As the etiology of these acquired PIG-A gene mutations is unknown, we hypothesized that patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> have overall genetic instability and acquire <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutations</z:hpo> throughout their genome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We first analyzed microsatellite sequences and found equivalent size variation using DNA from GPI-negative granulocytes compared with the DNA of paired GPI-positive B cell lines or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> granulocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We next quantitated the frequency of mutations at the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17368">hypoxanthine</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="16235">guanine</z:chebi> phosphoribosyl transferase (hprt) gene locus, and found 1 PNH patient with a large increase in hprt mutant frequency (256.7 x 10(-6) vs. 27.8 +/- 19.9 x 10(-6) for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> adults) that was confirmed on 4 independent blood samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also quantitated "illegitimate" VDJ genetic recombination events between the T cell receptor V gamma and J beta gene loci, and found a second <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> patient with a large increase (43.5 events per microgram of DNA vs. 1.3 +/- 0.8 events per microgram of DNA for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> adults), confirmed on 4 independent DNA samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> patients are young females with no history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our data show that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> patients can have increased numbers of acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001428'>somatic mutations</z:hpo> in gene loci distinct from PIG-A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that genetic instability may be associated with the development of PIG-A mutations that lead to the clinical picture of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
