<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, treatments still need to be developed for patients who do not have a HLA-identical donor and have not shown a clinical response to immunosuppressive therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We herein report on 2 patients in whom this problem could be overcome by transplantation of HLA-mismatched umbilical cord blood from unrelated donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two Japanese patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> underwent conditioning with fludarabine, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, and low-dose total-body irradiation and then received transplants of umbilical cord blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Engraftment of the three lineages occurred without problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that umbilical cord blood transplantation with a reduced-intensity conditioning regimen of fludarabine, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, and total-body irradiation for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> is a practical treatment and may be an attractive alternative for patients who does not have an HLA-identical donor and have shown no clinical response to immunosuppressive therapy </plain></SENT>
