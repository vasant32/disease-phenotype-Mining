<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The suppressive effect of peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMNC) from patients on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CFU-GM growth was also studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hence 69 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> were divided into three types: 10 cases of stem cell deficiency type, 30 cases of immuno-mediated type and 29 cases of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi> response type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>According to above classification, different treatment programs were practiced using both TCM and western medicine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi> response type, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi> and TCM were used and the effective rate reached 92.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the immuno-mediated type, in addition to TCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">Immunosuppressive agents</z:chebi> were cautiously used and the effective rate was 70.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>As for the stem cell deficiency type, 10 patients' conditions were usually very severe so comprehensive therapeutical means were adopted and 3 cases were improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The overall response rate of these three was 73.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results showed that the treatment program under the direction of classification have greatly improved the curative effect </plain></SENT>
