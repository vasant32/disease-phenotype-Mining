<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively analysed the outcome of consecutive children with idiopathic severe aplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> in the United Kingdom who received immunosuppressive therapy (IST) or matched unrelated donor (MUD) haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The 6-month cumulative response rate following rabbit antithymocyte globulin (ATG)/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">ciclosporin</z:chebi> (IST) was 32·5% (95% CI 19·3-46·6) (n = 43) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The 5-year estimated failure-free survival (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FFS</z:e>) following IST was 13·3% (95% confidence interval [CI] 4·0-27·8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, in 44 successive children who received a 10-antigen (HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1, -DQB1) MUD HSCT there was an excellent estimated 5-year <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FFS</z:e> of 95·01% (95% CI 81·38-98·74) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Forty of these children had failed IST previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HSCT conditioning was a fludarabine, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> and alemtuzumab (FCC) regimen and did not include radiotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There were no cases of graft failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Median donor chimerism was 100% (range 88-100%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A conditioning regimen, such as FCC that avoids total body irradiation is ideally suited in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that MUD HSCT following IST failure offers an excellent outcome and furthermore, if a suitable MUD can be found quickly, MUD HSCT may be a reasonable alternative to IST </plain></SENT>
