<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Other results were macroscopic and microscopic lesions in a wide range of organs, statistically significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> of body weights, AMG 5(2a) virus in the liver and feces, and high virus-neutralizing antibody titers to AMG 5(2a) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The disease produced was similar to that described in a previous report of AMG 5(2a) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> of chickens, and similar to inclusion body <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> as described in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, similar inoculation of chickens with maternal antibody to type-8 avian adenovirus resulted in no mortality, lesions in the liver only, no <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> of body weight, AMG 5(2a) virus in the feces only, and relatively low virus-neutralizing antibody titers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During this study a hemorrhagic-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> syndrome occurred in both AMG 5(2a)-inoculated and control chickens in one trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pathologic, virologic, and serologic findings indicated that the spontaneously occurring disease was not caused by an avian adenovirus </plain></SENT>
