<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In each case combined cytogenetic and proliferation analyses were performed with respect to the question, whether chromosome aberrations play a role in the in vitro response to GM-CSF and in order to search for stimulating effects on malignant cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The responsiveness was compared of aplastic and myelodysplastic cultures on the one hand and of leukemic cells on the other </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our results show that myelodysplastic and aplastic cells display a tendency for reduced susceptibility to GM-CSF as compared to healthy controls, while in leukemic bone marrow the response to the growth factor was significantly enhanced, indicating a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>-specific response pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the majority of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> analyzed, the presence of cytogenetically abnormal cells in cultures with excessive response to GM-CSF can be taken as a proof for stimulation of malignant cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The significance of these findings for pathogenesis and prognosis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> is discussed </plain></SENT>
