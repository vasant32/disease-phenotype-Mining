<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004810'>congenital hypoplastic anemia</z:hpo> Diamond-Blackfan, two with Fanconi's <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, one with congenital pancythopenia with hyperplastic marrow and five patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The increased serum erythropoietin level was found in every patient whose blood <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> was less than 12g% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Erythropoietin was detected in nonconcentrated urine when serum erythropoietin level was higher than 0,5 units/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The statistically significant negative correlation between the serum erythropoietin level and blood <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> concentration was found </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results presented, together with the results obtained by other authors, indicate that congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemias</z:hpo> studied here are not due to the disturbance in erythropoietin production </plain></SENT>
