<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A high level of expression has been reported in blasts from patients with various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The study was performed to evaluate the utility of monitoring WT1 expression in children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> at diagnosis, during therapy, and following bone marrow transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We tested a total of 204 samples prospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These included samples from patients with the following diagnoses: <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) at diagnosis (n = 45), at relapse (n = 14), and in remission (n = 45); <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> non-lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (ANLL) at diagnosis (n = 14), at relapse (n = 5), and in remission (n = 12); and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005699" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">blast crisis</z:e> (n = 1) and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phase (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 33 of these patients were transplanted: 19 ALL, 12 ANLL, and 2 <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, samples from 5 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and 28 controls were obtained from peripheral blood (n = 17), cord blood (n = 3), and bone marrow (n = 8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Primer pairs were designed to locate specific nucleotide sequences for <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> of WT1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RT-PCR was performed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> samples and compared with K562 cells from ATCC (defined as 1.0) as positive control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A positive test was arbitrarily defined as WT1/K562 &gt; 0.5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Samples at diagnosis and relapse, including 56 out of 59 ALL (95%), 26 ANLL (100%), and 1 <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005699" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">blast crisis</z:e>, demonstrated high levels of WT1 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In contrast, only 5 of 90 samples obtained in remission or post-transplant showed high levels of WT1 expression ( P &lt; 0.0001; 95% CI = 0.66-0.94) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The five patients with high WT1 expression during follow-up relapsed within 2 to 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, we have found that WT1 is consistently elevated in children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Significant differences in the level of WT1 expression were noted between these patients during diagnosis and at relapse, and those during remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>More importantly, following bone marrow transplant, a significant high level of WT1 expression preceded clinical relapse by 2 to 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Therefore, WT1 is a reliable marker for monitoring <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e> during therapy as well as in the post-transplant period </plain></SENT>
