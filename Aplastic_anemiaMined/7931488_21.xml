<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The records of 557 consecutive adult recipients of allogeneic-related and -unrelated and syngeneic bone marrow transplants (BMTs) were reviewed to determine the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751623" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Four hundred fifty-six patients were transplanted for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL; n = 79), <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e>; n = 182), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>; n = 195); 42 patients were transplanted for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) and 59 for a variety of other hematologic and nonhematologic disorders, malignant and nonmalignant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Conditioning regimens included high-dose chemotherapy with or without total-body irradiation (TBI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Statistical analyses determined the cumulative incidence of developing a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751623" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary cancer</z:e> and elucidated the associated risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Complete records (1 to 24 years of follow-up) on <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Nine patients developed 10 secondary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> for a cumulative actuarial risk of 12% (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.3 to 23.0) 11 years after transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The age-adjusted incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751623" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary cancer</z:e> was 4.2 times higher than that of primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> in the general population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eight of the 10 were epithelial in origin and three were cutaneous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>TBI and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) with a severity &gt; or = grade II were associated with the development of any <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751623" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD was a risk factor only for the development of secondary skin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Adult recipients of BMT face a significant risk of developing a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751623" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Their risk is similar to that of other patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> who are treated with chemoradiotherapy only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0205853" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Epithelial tumors</z:e>, rather than the more commonly reported Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, were most common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The fact that we did not routinely use T-cell-depleted marrow grafts nor anti-T-cell immunoglobulin for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD may explain this variance </plain></SENT>
