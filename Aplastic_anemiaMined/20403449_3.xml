<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To evaluate this risk, we analyzed outcomes after allogeneic HCT from HLA-identical sibling donors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> older patients with SAA at our center since 1988 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The 23 consecutive patients ranged in age from 40 to 68 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The conditioning regimen was <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (200 mg/kg) and horse antithymocyte globulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">Methotrexate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> were given for postgrafting immunosuppression </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our data favor a practice of extending HLA-identical sibling HCT for treatment of SAA in patients older than 40 years of age who are without significant medical comorbidities </plain></SENT>
