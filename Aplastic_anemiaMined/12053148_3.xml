<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To explore telomerase activity and its association with the proliferative potential of hematopoietic stem cells in bone marrow (BM) in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Telomerase activity of mononuclear cells separated from BM was determined with the TRAPeze kit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>BM specimens from 22 cases with AA and 7 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls were included </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SPSS10.0 was applied to analyze data derived from telomerase activity and colony-forming unit-granulocyte and monocyte </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median telomerase activity level of BM in AA was 2-fold higher than that in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was an inverse correlation in AA between telomerase activity and colony-forming unit (r = 0.78, p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>BM of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> AA expressed higher telomerase than that of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Telomerase activity in AA was increased and may be the result of the negative feedback of hematopoietic potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Telomerase activity varied between the subtypes of AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Telomerase activity was conversely correlated with the proliferative potential of BM in AA </plain></SENT>
