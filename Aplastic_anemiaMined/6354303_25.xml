<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Antithymocyte globulin (ATG) is frequently effective therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its mechanism of action is often assumed to be upon a lymphocyte inhibitor of hematopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, specificity for T lymphocytes would not be anticipated from consideration of the method of preparing ATG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In fact, using flow microfluorometry and fluorescence immunohistochemistry, we have found that ATG binds to virtually <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> circulating lymphocytes, granulocytes, and platelets, as well as to bone marrow cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Extensive absorption of ATG with either granulocytes or lymphocytes does not eliminate reactivity with the opposite cells, indicating that ATG recognizes some distinct antigens on each cell type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Treatment of cells with ATG blocks the binding of monoclonal antibodies directed against either lymphocyte differentiation or histocompatibility antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ATG also binds to visceral tissues, including thymus and testis cell membranes and the nuclear and cytoplasmic components of tonsil, kidney, liver, breast, lung, and intestine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In vitro cytotoxicity of ATG was demonstrated for both T and non- T lymphocytes and platelets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Despite its name, ATG is not specific for a particular cell type, and it would be premature to conclude that its effect is mediated through a specific lymphocyte population </plain></SENT>
