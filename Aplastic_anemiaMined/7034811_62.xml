<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Results in 43 patients so treated are presented along with those in 22 concurrent patients given marrow alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Most patients given buffy coat had positive in vitro tests of sensitization indicating a high risk for graft rejection, while <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one of the patients given marrow alone had negative tests </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thirty of the 43 (70%) patients given marrow and buffy coat are alive between 10 and 61 mo (median 36) after grafting; 4 died after graft rejection and 6 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) </plain></SENT>
