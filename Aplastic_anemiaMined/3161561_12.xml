<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To define further the role of marrow T suppressor lymphocytes in the pathogenesis of the hypoproliferative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> Rai clinical stages of B cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (CLL), marrow erythroid progenitor cell (CFU-E and BFU-E) frequency, marrow T gamma lymphocyte frequency per 1,000 nucleated marrow cells, and T cell-erythroid progenitor cell interactions were examined in 30 CLL patients and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As compared with control subjects, decreased numbers of CFU-E and BFU-E were found in patient marrow depleted of neoplastic B cells in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> Rai stages of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As a group, Rai stage III through IV patients with or without <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> (CLL-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath>) had significantly fewer CFU-E and BFU-E than did Rai O through II stage patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The numbers of T gamma cells infiltrating CLL marrows were increased 3, 9, and 20 times <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in Rai O through II, Rai III through IV, and CLL-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> groups, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Removal of T cells from marrow increased growth of CFU-E and BFU-E in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> Rai O through IV patients, but the increase was significant in the CLL-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> group only (P less than .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, autologous coculture of marrow T cells or T gamma cells but not B cells with marrow B + T-depleted null cells at ratios of 0.2:1 to 1:1 suppressed CFU-E and BFU-E growth in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three patient groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the hypoproliferative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> occurring in the course of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023434" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="BCLL">B cell CLL</z:e> is due to gradual accumulation in the marrow of T gamma lymphocytes which suppress erythroid progenitor cell growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>T gamma cell suppression of erythropoiesis and marrow T gamma cell expansion is detectable in the earliest Rai stages of the disease </plain></SENT>
