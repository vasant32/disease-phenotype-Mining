<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND SETTING: Survey of 342 institutions in 47 countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS: Numbers of patients receiving bone marrow transplantation for specific disease categories at institutions with active allogeneic bone marrow transplant programs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MAIN RESULTS: Patients (14,745) received allogeneic bone marrow transplantation between 1988 and 1990; of these, 1153 (8%) were from unrelated donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Reasons for transplantation were <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> (47%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (27%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> (10%), severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (9%), and other nonmalignant diseases (7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The number of allogeneic bone marrow transplants per million persons differed among countries, averaging 7.7 per million in North America and 5.7 per million in western Europe </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The use of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation continued to increase at a rate of more than 600 additional patients and 25 new transplant teams annually </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This rise is due in part to increasing use of unrelated volunteers as donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Resources allocated for transplants vary widely among countries </plain></SENT>
