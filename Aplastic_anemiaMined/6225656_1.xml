<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>T derived colony inhibitory activity (Td/CIA) was obtained from unstimulated T cells from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> patients (SAA), or from PWM primed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Td/CIA suppressed CFUC growth of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> allogeneic marrow to less than 30% of expected growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Td/CIA was then added to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> peripheral blood T and B cells, primed with PWM, to test whether it would interfere with in vitro immunoglobulin (Ig) production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When Td/CIA from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> T cells was added to cultures of T + B cells + PWM there was a 2-2.1-fold increase in Ig production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Similarly the addition of Td/CIA from SAA patients also resulted in a 1.4 up to 166-fold increase in Ig production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that either (a) the targets for Td/CIA are expressed on hemopoietic but not on T and B cells, or (b) that Td/CIA inactivates an accessory cell which is essential for CFUC growth but not for the PWM driven in vitro B cell differentiation system </plain></SENT>
