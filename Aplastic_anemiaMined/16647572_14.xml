<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Abnormal telomere shortening has been observed in a subset of individuals with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that genetic variation in two genes critical in telomere biology, TERF1 and TERF2, could be a risk factor for AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The proximal promoter and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> coding regions of TERF1 and TERF2 were sequenced in 47 individuals with acquired AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Regions with genetic variation were sequenced in an additional 95 AA patients and 289 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) frequencies were analyzed using co-dominant and dominant models and haplotypes determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Functional studies evaluated telomerase activity, telomere and telomeric overhang lengths, and TRF2 protein expression in select patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two nonsynonymous amino acid changes were detected, one in exon 9 of TERF1 and another in exon 6 of TERF2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These sequence variants resulted in conservative amino acid changes and were not predicted to alter TRF1 or TRF2 protein expression or function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>SNP and haplotype analyses in acquired AA patients suggested that one variant allele, in intron 9 of TERF1, and haplotype could be associated with increased risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (OR 1.59, 95% confidence interval 1.06-2.39, p = 0.033) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>TERF2 SNPs and haplotypes were not significantly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: It is possible that a common genetic variant in TERF1 is associated with risk for AA but additional studies are required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Highly penetrant, non-synonymous, or insertion-deletion mutations in TERF1 and TERF2 were not identified and therefore are not likely to be major genetic risk factors for the development of AA </plain></SENT>
