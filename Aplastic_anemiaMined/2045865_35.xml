<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this trial, we treated 24 patients with recombinant human IL-3 given by a daily 4-hour intravenous infusion for 28 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The dose levels were 30, 60, 125, 250, 500, 750, and 1,000 micrograms/m2/d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At least three patients were entered at every dose level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each participant suffered from <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo>, with the underlying diagnosis being <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (13 patients), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (eight patients), or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> after prolonged high-dose chemotherapy (three patients) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Most patients tolerated therapy well, with the most frequent side effects being <z:hpo ids='HP_0011134'>low-grade fever</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headaches</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hematopoietic changes included modest increases in neutrophil counts (eight patients), eosinophil counts (six patients), platelet counts (three patients), and reticulocyte counts (two patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An increase in blasts occurred in one patient who had <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts in transformation and was reversible once IL-3 was discontinued </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, one patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> showed an increase in monocytes (and granulocytes) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Progression to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> did not occur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Pharmacokinetic analyses showed a rapid clearance with a mean half-life of 18.8 minutes at the 60 micrograms/m2/d dose, and 52.9 minutes at the 250 micrograms/m2/d dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Serum concentrations of 10 to 20 ng/mL of IL-3 were achievable at the 250 micrograms/m2/d dose </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Our observations indicate that recombinant human IL-3 can be given safely at doses of 1,000 micrograms/m2/d or less </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In addition, on the basis of preclinical data and the biologic activity observed in this study, further trials of this molecule, alone and in combination with other growth factors, are warranted in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
