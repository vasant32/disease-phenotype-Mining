<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study was initiated to evaluate the in vivo infectivity and pathogenicity of a group of recombinant feline <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> viruses (rFeLVs) previously generated by in vitro forced recombination between a FeLV subgroup A virus (FeLV-A) and an endogenous FeLV (enFeLV) envelope (env) element (Sheets et al., 1992, Virology 190, 849-855) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine infectivity of rFeLVs, neonatal cats were inoculated with rFeLVs alone or in combination with FeLV-A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The recombinant viruses were able to replicate efficiently in vivo only when administered along with FeLV-A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of six co-infected cats, three developed thymic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0079734" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphosarcomas</z:e>, one severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, and two <z:hpo ids='HP_0004326'>cachexia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo>; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> were viremic and seroconverted shortly after inoculation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>While both virus types were detected in virtually <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> tissues examined from these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e>-bearing cats, there was a particularly noteworthy sequence reversion in the rFeLVs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is known that exogenous FeLV isolates carry a conserved neutralizing MGPNL <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> in the middle of the surface <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> domain of the env gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the parental recombinant viruses used to inoculate these cats harbored the enFeLV-derived MGPNP sequence at this position </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> in vivo-propagated recombinants displayed the MGPNL sequence, while the env-encoded backbone flanking the MGPNL sequence was that of the parental recombinant virus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that viruses with the MGPNL <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> have an in vivo proliferative advantage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The data also provide an explanation for the conservation of this <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi> in exogenous FeLVs despite the existence of variant forms in enFeLV proviral elements with which they can recombine </plain></SENT>
