<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The IL-3 levels in patients with active AA were significantly lower, both in PHA-stimulated conditioned medium (CM) and in ALG-CM, than those of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> healthy donors (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e>; p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The degree of reduced IL-3 production in AA patients correlated well with the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo>; the level of IL-3 returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> after successful treatment with ALG plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi> (ALG therapy) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, GM-CSF production in AA patients varied widely and was only significant in remission patients in PHA-CM; in this case production was higher than that in active AA patients (p &lt; 0.05) or in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sensitivity to PHA or ALG stimulation was evaluated by the ratio of IL-3 concentrations in ALG-CM versus PHA-CM (ALG/PHA index) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The index varied widely from &lt; 0.1 to &gt; 10 in AA patients, contrasting to the clustered values in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Seven of the eight patients who had an ALG/PHA index of &gt; 1.0 showed a good clinical response to ALG therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, 12 of the 14 patients who had a lower index (&lt; 1.0) failed to respond </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The ALG/PHA index might have an ability to predict the response to ALG therapy </plain></SENT>
