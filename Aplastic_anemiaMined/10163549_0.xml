<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>There is great interest in the use of peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) for allogeneic transplantation, based on the good results seen with autologous PBSC infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Reasonable caution exists regarding the use of allogeneic PBSC for transplantation because of donor toxicities due to rhG-CSF administration and the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host-disease</z:e> (GVHD) in the recipient because of the large number of T-cell infused </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We present preliminary data on allogeneic PBSC collections and transplantation in ten patients affected by advanced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (eight patients), severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (one patient) and sickle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (one patient) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Seven donors were HLA-identical siblings, while the other three were mismatched for three, two and one locus, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> donors received rhG-CSF at a dose of 12 micrograms/kg for a mean of 5 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Leukaphereses were performed with the aim of collecting a minimum of 5 x 10(6)/kg (recipient's weight) CD 34+ cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Collection timing was determined by monitoring CD 34+ cells in the donor's peripheral blood from the second day of rhG-CSF therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The PBSC collections yielded a mean of 10.05 x 10(8) MNCs/kg and of 10.48 x 10(6) CD 34+ cells/kg (recipient's weight) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>PBSC were immediately infused after collection in patients given myeloablative therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Engraftment was observed in each patient at a mean of 13.2 days for an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) more than 0.5 x 10(9)/L and of 26.5 days for a platelet count of more than 20 x 10(9)/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Eight patients experienced no or moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD, whereas two patients died of grade 4 GVHD, notwithstanding GVHD prophylaxis with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Two other patients died of <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026946" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fungal infections</z:e>, respectively, despite prophylaxis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The remaining six patients are alive between 58 and 430 days after transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our results document that allogeneic PBSC are capable of engraftment after a myeloablative regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Controlled trials are necessary to compare the potential benefits of this approach with the results obtained in allogeneic bone marrow transplantation </plain></SENT>
