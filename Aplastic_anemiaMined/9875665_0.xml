<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report on a 13-year old girl with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and hypertrophic cranial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030167" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pachymeningitis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>She was admitted to our hospital with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002013'>vomiting</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A computerized tomographic (CT) scan of the brain on the third day of symptoms showed a hyperdense area in the tentorial region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed iso-intensity in the same tentorial region in T1- and T2-weighted images, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi> enhancement of this region suggested a thickened dura mater </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Initially, a diagnosis of subdural or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> was made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Since her platelet count was low (3000/microl) making the patient a poor-risk candidate for surgery, and the area was limited to the dura mater, conservative therapy, including <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">glycerol</z:chebi> administration and platelet transfusion, was carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Despite clinical improvement 10 days after admission without specific therapy, the iso-intense region on the left side of the tentorial region remained unchanged on MRI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, the iso-intense area on the right side of the tentorial region became hyperdense on T1-weighted MRI images and was also enhanced by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33375">gadolinium</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cerebrospinal fluid findings were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> except for slightly elevated protein at 62 mg/dl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A diagnosis of hypertrophic cranial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030167" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pachymeningitis</z:e> of the tentorial dura mater with <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> on the right side was made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although hypertrophic cranial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030167" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pachymeningitis</z:e> is a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0678236" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rare disease</z:e>, it must be considered in the differential diagnosis of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> in a case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
