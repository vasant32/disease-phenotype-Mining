<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The study presented here analyses the relationship between mitotic activity in standardised cytogenetic bone marrow preparations from three haematological diseases and diagnostic and clinical parameters, most importantly the outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The disorders studied were: <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>Acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) (N=107), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>) (N=166) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> in childhood (AA) (N=39) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A strict protocol of quantitative standardisation of cytogenetic slides was adhered to ensuring comparability both cross-sectionally and longitudinally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The samples were studied after short-term incubation without mitogenic in vitro stimuli </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most important findings include: i) ALL: Immunological subtypes can be differentiated according to their proliferation profile; there is a striking difference between childhood and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751606" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">adult ALL</z:e> in proliferation activity; most importantly initial proliferation is much higher in patients who will relapse than in those with stable remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ii) <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>: Philadelphia-positive <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> shows proliferation activities quite distinct from Philadelphia-negative <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>; however there is only a small change in the proliferative activity from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phase to the accelerated phase or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0005699" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">blast crisis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>iii) AA: Very low proliferation scores rise quickly to near <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels during immunosuppressive therapy in most patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Higher levels at diagnosis are associated with a faster and better response to therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, assessment of the proliferative activity in cytogenetic preparations made from bone marrow samples of patients with haematological disease may add valuable information as to diagnostic sub-groups and clinical course and may contribute to therapeutic decisions </plain></SENT>
