<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To test the hypothesis of a similar mechanism in humans, we studied the formation of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="29865">benzo(a)pyrene</z:chebi> DNA adducts and water-soluble metabolites in skin fibroblasts from eight patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and eight <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The ratio of water-soluble metabolites and DNA adducts was 46.5 +/- 16.6 in patients and was significantly lower as compared to 82.9 +/- 38.5 in controls (P less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We conclude that increased formation of genotoxic intermediates may be a pathogenetic mechanism in some patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
