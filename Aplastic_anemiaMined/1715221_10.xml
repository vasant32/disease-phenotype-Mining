<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to analyze at the clonal level the phenotype and functions of T cells from patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (SAA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For this purpose we studied 175 T-cell clones obtained from peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) of four SAA patients and 97 clones from two healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The percentage of CD8+ T-cell clones obtained from the patients' PB and BM was higher, but not significantly (P = .07 and P = .14, respectively), than that obtained in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A higher proportion of T-cell clones from SAA patients exhibited lectin-dependent cytolytic activity and especially natural killer-like activity when compared with controls (PB: P less than .01, P less than .05; BM: P less than .05, P less than .01, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lymphokine release was tested before and after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi> stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A number of patients' clones were able to release interferons (IFNs) spontaneously (PB: 28.6% v 0%, P less than .05; BM: 28.6% v 0%, P less than .10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi> stimulation, patients' BM T-cell clones produced IFNs in greater proportions (90.9% v 46.7%, P less than .01) and in greater quantities (PB: 25.5 arbitrary units [AU]/mL v 5.7 AU/mL, P less than .03; BM: 26 AU/mL v 9.1 AU/mL, P = .011) as compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor (TNF) activity was not found in supernatants of unprimed T-cell clones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>After <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi> stimulation, PB T-cell microcultures produced TNF alpha in greater proportions (97.9% v 72.2%, P less than .01) and, also in this case, in greater quantities (PB: 7.2 AU/mL v 1.5 AU/mL, P = .007; BM: 9.9 AU/mL v 1.5 AU/mL, P = .003) than controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, T-cell clones from SAA patients exhibit predominantly a CD8+ phenotype, a greater cytotoxic activity, and can be shown to produce greater quantities of suppressor lymphokines when compared with controls </plain></SENT>
