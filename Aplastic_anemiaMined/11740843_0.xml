<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Renal biopsy specimens from two female patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036830" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">serum sickness</z:e> that ensued after application of anti-lymphocyte horse globulin for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> were analyzed by light microscopy, immunofluorescence, and electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To prove the depositions of foreign protein, frozen sections were incubated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="31624">fluorescein</z:chebi>-conjugated anti-horse protein serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical analysis was performed on B5-fixed paraplast-embedded tissue or frozen <z:chebi fb="15" ids="15347">acetone</z:chebi>-fixed sections with the primary antibodies for molecules/cell markers CD35, CD43, CD45RO, CD68, CD2, lysozime, L26, and S100 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Diffuse proliferating and <z:hpo ids='HP_0008653'>necrotizing glomerulonephritis</z:hpo> with crescents was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were coarse granular mesangial, subepithelial, subendothelial, and intramembranaceous deposits of mainly horse globulin, C3, and IgG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most mesangium infiltrating cells were macrophages and T-lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Electron microscopy revealed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>hypertrophy</z:mpath> of podocytes, but immunohistochemistry did not show their <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CD35 (C3b-receptor) staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Apart from epithelial cells, main crescent forming cells were macrophages and T-lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Rare dendritic cells and abundant infiltration of macrophages, T-lymphocytes, and neutrophiles were found in the interstitium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036830" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">serum sickness</z:e>, glomeruli and tubuli are destroyed beyond the range usually seen in other types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000099'>glomerulonephritis</z:hpo> caused by immune complexes, except in cases with widespread crescents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_159'>Hypertrophy</z:mpath> of podocytes and loss of their <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> C3b-receptor staining has not yet been described in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>C3b-receptors on podocytes could play a role in pathogenesis of glomerular injury caused by immune complexes </plain></SENT>
