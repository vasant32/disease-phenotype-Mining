<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To explore the therapeutic effectiveness of combination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> (CsA) and <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi> in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (CAA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">Androgen</z:chebi> alone or combined with CsA for the treatment of CAA was compared by a randomized controlled clinical trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULT: The efficacy of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi> combined with CsA (87.9%) was higher than that of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi> alone (57.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therapeutic effectiveness of the combination treatment between the patients with positive and negative peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNCs) inhibiting <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colony formation unit-granulocyte and macrophage (CFU-GM) test showed a significant difference (P &lt; 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">Androgen</z:chebi> combined with CsA had a much better efficacy than that of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi> alone in the treatment of CAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patients' PBMNCs inhibiting <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CFU-GM growth test can be used as an index of the treatment outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The side effects of the combination therapy are low and tolerable </plain></SENT>
