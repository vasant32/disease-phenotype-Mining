<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>After bone marrow transplantation many T-lymphocyte functions, including the production of cytokines (CK), such as interleukin 2, are severely depressed for months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The monocyte-derived cytokines <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor alpha and interleukin 6 are molecules central to immune functions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moreover, they may be involved in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> and in graft-versus-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hence, we have studied the reappearance of these CKs after BMT by analyzing whole blood cultures stimulated in vitro with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi> for 6 hr, followed by testing for the secretion of TNF in the WEHI 164/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27666">actinomycin D</z:chebi> cytotoxicity bioassay and for IL-6 in the 7 TD 1 proliferation assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We performed sequential studies in 6 children who were transplanted for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> with allogeneic bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found that the production of both CKs can be induced as early as 10-14 days post BMT at the very beginning of engraftment, indicating that the regenerating monocyte system is recovering rapidly after BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>Depletion</z:mpath> and neutralization experiments confirmed that monocytes are the cellular source of the LPS-induced CK secretion after BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Control levels were reached 3 to 4 weeks post BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>When analyzing the endotoxin-induced CK production in a larger panel of BMT patients after complete reconstitution, we could not detect any impact of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GvHD, or of allogeneic or autologous BMT, nor did treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> A (CsA) show any suppressive effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Thus, our data show that the CK production of the monocyte/macrophage lineage is quite resistant to factors that do influence other cell lineages of the immune system during BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The coincident appearance of monocyte-derived cytokines and of GvHD suggests a role for these cytokines in GvHD in man </plain></SENT>
