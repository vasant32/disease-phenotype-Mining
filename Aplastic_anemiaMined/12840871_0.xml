<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On the 14th day, the expression of CD49d, CD49c, cyclinD2 in bone marrow mononuclear cells (MNC) was examined by flow cytometry, and VCAM-1 on stromal cells was immunohistochemically measured by Strept Avidin-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">Biotin</z:chebi> Complex (SABC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The expression of CD49d, CD49c, VCAM-1 and cyclinD2 in ligustrazine-treated group was significantly higher than that in AA group (P &lt; 0.01), but the ratio of G0 + G1 phase cells was significantly lower than that in AA group (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results showed that ligustrazine could improve the expression of adherent molecule and cyclin D2 in the bone marrow of mice with immune-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, thereby promoting the growth of hematopoietic cells </plain></SENT>
