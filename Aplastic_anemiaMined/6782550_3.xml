<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In a prospective group study, 254 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> treated with a high dose of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="50113">androgens</z:chebi> were followed a minimum of 4 months and up to 8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Damage to the liver was evaluated by the appearance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000952'>jaundice</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002910'>abnormal liver function tests</z:hpo>; these parameters were evaluated at least every 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of these patients, 17.3% had overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0000952'>jaundice</z:hpo> and 18.2% <z:mp ids='MP_0000609'>abnormal hepatic function</z:mp> tets (total 35.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The anomalies appeared rapidly, before month 4 for 50% of the patients and before month 10 for 80% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They were more frequent in men than in women or children, but not linked with previous biological abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nor did frequency depend on whether C17 <z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi> or C17 ethyl <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi> was used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Associated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> offered no protection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>None of the patients showed severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0000952'>jaundice</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>If the treatment was stopped, readministration led to relapse of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000952'>jaundice</z:hpo> in only one-third of the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Only two patients in this series revealed a nonmalignant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> of the liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Therefore, this complication does not seem to suggest restriction in the use of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="50113">androgens</z:chebi> at high dosage and for long periods, considering the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
