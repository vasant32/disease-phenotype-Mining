<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This was associated with a reduced ability of their serum to inhibit the growth of a test strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serum iron, transferrin, and related parameters were measured serially in patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It was found that a high proportion of these patients also have a high saturation of their transferrin with iron </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This was related to three distinct physiologic deficits: a low level of serum transferrin; a high level of iron; and an inability to reduce the level of serum iron during <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three of six patients who were unable to reduce their serum during <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> subsequently died of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data support the hypothesis that derangements in nonspecific serologic defense mechanisms involving iron contribute to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002719'>susceptibility to infection</z:hpo> in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> undergoing bone marrow transplantation </plain></SENT>
