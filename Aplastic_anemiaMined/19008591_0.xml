<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 68-year-old man was referred to us with clinical and bone marrow (BM) features compatible with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The correct diagnosis, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> of the BM coexisting with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo>, became apparent after noting rouleaux in the peripheral blood (PB) and approximately 50% plasma cells in the touch imprint of one of the two BM biopsies done </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As standard therapy was precluded, the patient was put on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi> but died within 4 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This first case of the coexistence of untreated <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> with aplastic BM shows that even apparently straightforward <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> seen on the BM biopsy should be interpreted in conjunction with the PB smear and the BM touch imprint findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among other things, the BM biopsy and imprint should be repeated if the PB has findings such as rouleaux that do not fit with straightforward <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The combination of <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> and BM <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> precludes standard therapy and is rapidly fatal </plain></SENT>
