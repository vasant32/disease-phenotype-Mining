<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, TT virus (TTV), a novel DNA virus, was identified in a Japanese patient with posttransfusion non-A-E <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The prevalence of TTV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> was investigated among blood donors and patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> in Thailand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of 99 blood samples from blood donors, 37 tested positive for TTV DNA via semi-nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using TTV-specific primers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seventeen percent of samples from blood donors younger than 20 were positive for TTV DNA, whereas 48% from donors older than 20 were positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The high prevalence of TTV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> in Thailand is comparable to that reported in China (28%), Mongolia (43%), and Egypt (29%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Forty-two percent of newly diagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> patients tested also had TTV DNA in blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The detection rate of TTV DNA in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> patients does not differ significantly from rates in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> blood donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our present data thus argue against the role of this novel <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo>-associated virus in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> in Thailand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, larger epidemiological studies may be needed to further evaluate their association </plain></SENT>
