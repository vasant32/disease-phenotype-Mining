<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A study was made of the survival time of erythrocytes labeled with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50076">51Cr</z:chebi> in 30 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001908'>hypoplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 96.7% of the patients erythrocyte survival time was reduced (from 18 to 3.6 days; an average of 11.8 days), an increase in the number of macrocytes was noted (in 83.3%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mean volume and thickness of erythrocytes were also on an increase (in 95.8%); a decrease in the spherical index of erythrocytes was noted (in 91.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this connection erythrokaryocyte proliferation enhancement was noted in 58.3% of the patients in parallel with a decrease in the total number of myelokaryocytes in 37.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients' response to multimodality therapy was different irrespective of erythrocyte survival time in the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001908'>hypoplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In satisfactory preservation of medullary hemopoietic foci, particularly with polymorphous cell composition, multimodality therapy including splenectomy, produced mainly a curative effect in patients of different age with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001908'>hypoplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
