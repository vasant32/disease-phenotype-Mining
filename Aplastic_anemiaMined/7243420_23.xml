<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The method is based on the effect of the bifunctional <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agent</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27504">mitomycin C</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="172" ids="27504">MMC</z:chebi>) on chromosomes of peripheral lymphocytes in culture 92 to 96 hours </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At the highest concentration of 80 ng/ml of <z:chebi fb="172" ids="27504">MMC</z:chebi>, about a 50-fold increase of chromosomal breaks and a 200-fold increase of radial figures was observed in Fanconi <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> lymphocytes in comparison with the average values for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> cells or cells of healthy control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, sister chromatoid exchange analysis of cells treated with <z:chebi fb="172" ids="27504">MMC</z:chebi> demonstrated a marked inhibition of mitotic activity of lymphocytes of patients with increased sensitivity to <z:chebi fb="172" ids="27504">MMC</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is advocated that the <z:chebi fb="172" ids="27504">MMC</z:chebi>-stress test should be used in each case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo>, as part of the therapy planning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cytoreduction regimens used prior to bone marrow transplantation may produce lethal complications in patients with high clastogenic response to <z:chebi fb="172" ids="27504">MMC</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
