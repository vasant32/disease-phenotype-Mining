<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To assess the biologic activities of recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, we gave GM-CSF (60 to 500 micrograms per square meter of body-surface area) to 10 patients with moderate or severe disease, by continuous intravenous infusion daily for two weeks, and repeated the treatment after a two-week rest period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The treatment increased the white-cell count (1.6- to 10-fold) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, primarily because of an increase in the numbers of neutrophils (1.5 to 20-fold), eosinophils (12- to greater than 70-fold), and monocytes (2- to 32-fold) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Rates of <z:chebi fb="17" ids="16240">hydrogen peroxide</z:chebi> production in purified granulocyte fractions increased during GM-CSF treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Increases in bone marrow cellularity, myeloid precursor cells, and myeloid:erythroid cell ratios accompanied the white-cell response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Despite the in vivo response of the white-cells, the concentration of colony-forming cells remained the same </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Measurable concentrations of interleukin-2 (2 to 15 units per milliliter) were found in the serum of 8 patients, and high levels of erythropoietin (81 to 1200 IU per liter) were found in 10 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The predominant side effects were constitutional symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that recombinant human GM-CSF is effective in stimulating myelopoiesis in patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and may benefit some patients in whom the disorder is refractory to standard forms of therapy </plain></SENT>
