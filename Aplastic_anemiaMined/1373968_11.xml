<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied the production of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) by stromal cells from 33 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Complete, confluent stromal layers were produced by 29 of the 33 samples using the long-term bone marrow culture (LTBMC) system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The concentration of G-CSF, GM-CSF, and IL-6 in culture media with or without interleukin-1 (IL-1) stimulation was determined by an enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay (ELISA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The spontaneous production of G-CSF, GM-CSF, and IL-6 did not differ significantly between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls and the patients with AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The ability of stromal cells to release the three hematopoietic growth factors in response to IL-1 was either <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or elevated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also studied the change in production of G-CSF, GM-CSF, and IL-6 by stromal cells before and after antilymphocyte globulin (ALG) therapy in 16 patients with AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no correlation between the change in production of these cytokines and the response to ALG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast to previous studies that showed a defect in the production of hematopoietic growth factors by stromal cells from patients with AA, the results indicated a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or elevated production of G-CSF, GM-CSF, and IL-6 by marrow stromal cells in patients with AA </plain></SENT>
