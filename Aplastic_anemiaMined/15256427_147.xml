<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Currently, chemical analysis of needle biopsy specimens is the most common accepted method of measurement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study presents a readily available noninvasive method of measuring and imaging LICs in vivo using clinical 1.5-T magnetic resonance imaging units </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mean liver proton transverse relaxation rates (R2) were measured for 105 humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A value for the LIC for each subject was obtained by chemical assay of a needle biopsy specimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>High degrees of sensitivity and specificity of R2 to biopsy LICs were found at the clinically significant LIC thresholds of 1.8, 3.2, 7.0, and 15.0 mg Fe/g dry tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A calibration curve relating liver R2 to LIC has been deduced from the data covering the range of LICs from 0.3 to 42.7 mg Fe/g dry tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Proton transverse relaxation rates in aqueous paramagnetic solutions were also measured on each magnetic resonance imaging unit to ensure instrument-independent results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Measurements of proton transverse relaxivity of aqueous MnCl2 phantoms on 13 different magnetic resonance imaging units using the method yielded a coefficient of variation of 2.1% </plain></SENT>
