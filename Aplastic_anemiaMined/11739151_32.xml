<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The hypothesis was considered that expansion of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> clone may be a marker of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_194'>immune-mediated disease</z:mpath> and its association with HLA alleles was examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study involved patients with a primary diagnosis of AA, patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), and patients with primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Tests of proportions were used to compare allelic frequencies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For patients with a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> clone (defined by the presence of GPI-AP-deficient granulocytes), regardless of clinical manifestations, there was a higher than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> incidence of HLA-DR2 (58% versus 28%; z = 4.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The increased presence of HLA-DR2 was found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> frankly hemolytic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> and in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> (AA/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>HLA-DR2 was more frequent in AA/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> (56%) than in AA without a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> clone (37%; z = 3.36) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Analysis of a second cohort of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> treated with immunosuppression showed that HLA-DR2 was associated with a hematologic response (50% of responders versus 34% of nonresponders; z = 2.69) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both the presence of HLA-DR2 and the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> clone were independent predictors of response but the size of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> clone did not correlate with improvement in blood count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that clonal expansion of GPI-AP-deficient cells is linked to HLA and likely related to an immune mechanism </plain></SENT>
