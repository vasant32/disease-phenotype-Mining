<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One patient with minimal residual myelopoiesis responded transiently to two separate courses of GM-CSF at 4 and 8 micrograms/kg/d administered intravenously and another course at 4 micrograms/kg/d administered subcutaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_681'>Septicemia</z:mpath> and bilateral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> that had been resistant to conventional therapy resolved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three patients with no evidence of residual myelopoiesis did not respond to GM-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In one patient, the dose was increased to 32 micrograms/kg/d with no effect on hematopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Immediate side effects were minimal at GM-CSF doses up to 16 micrograms/kg/d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>GM-CSF may, however, have been involved in the pathophysiology of <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> of the inferior vena cava in the patient administered 32 micrograms/kg/d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that GM-CSF does not induce hematopoiesis in long-standing, severe, treatment-resistant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> with complete myelopoietic failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, in patients with minimal residual myelopoiesis, GM-CSF could be a promising adjuvant therapy for severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
