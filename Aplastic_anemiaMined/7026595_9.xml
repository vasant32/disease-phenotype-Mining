<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients receiving oxymetholone therapy had abnormal <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and/or IRI values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This finding was independent of GH, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17650">cortisol</z:chebi>, and glucagon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In one patient, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and IRI levels were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> before oxymetholone but became abnormally elevated after the use of this drug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> and IRI values were present in the single patient not receiving oxymetholone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, a positive relationship was demonstrated between oxymetholone administration and the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000833'>glucose intolerance</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000855'>insulin resistance</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
