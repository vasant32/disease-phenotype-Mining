<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We assessed the incidence and the outcome of concomitant AID in a retrospective, single-center study of 243 patients with severe AA treated between 1974 and 2006 with either immunosuppression (186) or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (57) and a median follow-up time of 9.3 years (0-33) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinically manifest AID were observed in 24 out of 243 (10 +/- 3.7%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Age at diagnosis of AA was significantly younger in patients without AID compared to patients with AID (median, 20 versus 52 years; P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 12 patients where the diagnosis of AID was done before AA therapy, response to antithymocyte globulin was good for AA (ten out of 12) but not for AID (2 out of 12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 13 patients in which AID occurred after first-line therapy, the median time to the AID was 7 years (range 3 months-27.5 years) </plain></SENT>
