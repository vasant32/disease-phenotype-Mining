<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Seven patients (4%) on biopsy were found to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seven of the 176 patients (4%) with marrow biopsies that confirmed the pathologic diagnosis of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> were found to have clonal cytogenetic abnormalities in unstimulated marrow samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among the 169 patients with typical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and no cytogenetic abnormalities, 5 (3%) subsequently developed either <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two of three patients with pathologically confirmed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and clonal cytogenetic abnormalities, who were not transplanted, developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that approximately 4% of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> have clonal cytogenetic abnormalities of marrow cells, and that while <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> may have some risk of developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, those with a cytogenetic abnormality have an especially high risk </plain></SENT>
