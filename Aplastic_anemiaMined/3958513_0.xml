<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The addition of HC did not increase CFU-e colony formation in 11 patients </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among the nine patients showing no HC effect in vitro, two subsequently improved with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="50113">androgens</z:chebi> and one each with anti-thymocyte globulin and anti-lymphocyte globulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that the in vitro <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> effect may not necessarily correlate with responsiveness to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
