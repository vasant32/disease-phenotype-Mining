<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) data for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">ciclosporin</z:chebi> were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The population pharmacokinetic model of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">ciclosporin</z:chebi> was described using the nonlinear mixed-effects modeling (NONMEM) VI software </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The final model was validated using bootstrap and normalized prediction distribution errors.Results:A one-compartment model with first-order absorption and elimination was developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The estimated CL/F was 15.1, which was lower than those of children receiving stem cell or kidney transplant reported in the West (16.9-29.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The weight normalized CL/F was 0.45 (range: 0.27-0.70) L/h/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The covariate analysis identified body weight, serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> and concomitant administration of the anabolic steroid stanozolol as individual factors influencing the CL/F of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">ciclosporin</z:chebi>.Conclusion:Our model could be used to optimize the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">ciclosporin</z:chebi> dosing regimen in Chinese children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
