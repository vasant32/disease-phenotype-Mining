<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The clinical data of 55 children with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (SAA) and 51 children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (CAA) were retrospectively analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received IST from January 2007 to December 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In children with CAA, the effective rate of antithymocyte globulin (ATG) plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> A(CsA) combination therapy was significantly higher than that of CsA alone (80% vs 44%; P&lt;0.05); in children with SAA, the effective rate of ATG plus CsA combination therapy was also significantly higher than that of CsA alone (75% vs 40%; P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No patients developed clonal disease such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, paroxysmal nocturn <z:hpo ids='HP_0003641'>hemoglobinuria</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelocytic leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In patients treated with the ATG plus CsA combination therapy, the response rate was relatively high for children whose disease course was less than six months, bone marrow hematopoietic area was more than 40%, had no severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e>, and experienced granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) reaction during the early treatment; however, it was not related to AA subtypes and age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: ATG plus CsA combination therapy is effective and safe in the treatment of childhood AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The disease course, bone marrow hematopoietic area, severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> and G-CSF reaction to early treatment are the main factors influencing the therapeutic effects </plain></SENT>
