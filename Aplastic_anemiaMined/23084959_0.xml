<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The aim of the work was to detect the presence of anti-human leukocyte antigens (anti-HLAs) class I and II antibodies in sera of multitransfused <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> pediatric patients using two different techniques </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The effect of the implemented transfusion practice on the frequency of these antibodies was studied as well as their effect on the patient's clinical condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Flowcytometry panel reactive antibodies (FlowPRAs) for HLA class I and II were determined and compared to the results obtained by Complement-dependent-cytotoxicity (CDC) assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Over the past 3years, 20 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> patients received leukoreduced blood components, 5/20 patients received leukoreduced products exclusively throughout their disease (group1), 15/20 patients had received non-leukoreduced components previously (group2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>None of the patients in group1 was FlowPRA positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Six patients from group2 (40%) were FlowPRA positive, only four out of these six patients showed positive CDC test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Positive and negative predictive values of CDC were 44.4 and 81.4% respectively, with 65% accuracy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Platelet refractoriness was encountered in 13/20 patients; only 3 out of these 13 patients (23%) were FlowPRA I positive (38Â±18%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One refractory patient died from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>His FlowPRA I was 65.7% and CDC assay failed to detect it </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Leukoreduction of blood components minimizes the incidence of HLA <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948201" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">alloimmunization</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further investigations for other immune causes of platelet refractoriness are recommended </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>FCM is a simple and reliable technique for detection of anti-HLA antibodies, while CDC assay lacks sensitivity and specificity </plain></SENT>
