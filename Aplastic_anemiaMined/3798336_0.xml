<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The formation of the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> precipitate following plasma incubation in the cold in the presence of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> is determined by FN involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fibrinogen (FG) is another main component of the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> precipitate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To determine the functional activity of plasma FN in <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> and other pathological conditions, a study was made of the ability of FN and FG to go into the precipitate formed in blood plasma in the cold after its incubation with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Unlike <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects in whom over 80% of FN on the average and about 20% of FG went into the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> precipitate, in patients with hemoblastoses and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> complicated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo>, less than 40% of FN on the average and about 7% of FG went into the precipitate </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The reduction of FN ability to go into the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> precipitate correlated with the gravity of the patients' condition </plain></SENT>
