<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analyzed retrospective results in 141 patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> who received transplants between 1988 and 1995 from an unrelated volunteer donor identified through the National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had failed one or more courses of immunosuppressive therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the patients, 121 (86%) received a radiation-containing conditioning regimen, and 20 (14%) were given chemotherapy only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Based on serologic human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing (class I and II), 105 patients (74%) received HLA-matched marrow, and 36 (26%) received marrow mismatched for at least one HLA-A, -B, or -DR antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Allele-level (molecular) typing for HLA-DRB1 was available in 108 donor-recipient pairs; 77 patients received DRB -matched and 31 DRB1-mismatched transplants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> but 13% of patients were given a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi>-containing regimen for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-vs.-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) prophylaxis, and 45 patients (32%) received marrow that was T cell-depleted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among 131 evaluable patients, 116 (89%) achieved sustained engraftment and 15 (11%) did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among patients with engraftment, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD of grades II-IV developed in 60 patients (52%) and extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD in 24 patients at risk (31%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Currently, 51 patients (36%) are surviving at 11-94 months (median 36) after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> but five have Karnofsky scores &gt; or =80 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients who received a serologically matched transplant fared somewhat better than did patients given a serologically mismatched transplant p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Patients with donors matched by both serology and allele-level DRB1 typing had significantly better survival than DRB1-mismatched patients with 56 vs. 15% surviving at 3 years p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Outcome in patients transplanted within 3 years of diagnosis was superior to that among patients transplanted with greater delay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Major causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were graft failure, GVHD, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>These data suggest that unrelated marrow transplantation offers successful therapy for a proportion of patients who have failed immunosuppressive therapy </plain></SENT>
