<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have developed a practical conditioning regimen without anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG), irradiation, or other myeloablative <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agent</z:chebi> for low-income countries in which patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (SAA), who usually have heavily transfused and a prolonged disease history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The application of ATG, Busulphan, and/or irradiation to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (Cy) to avoid graft rejection has many short- and long-term complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we focused on evaluating a fludarabine-based conditioning regimen, among 83 patients with SAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were treated with fludarabine (40 mg/m(2) /d; day [-5 to -2]) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (50 mg/kg/d; day [-5 to -2]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Altogether, 81 patients indicated initial engraftment, whereas two cases showed primary graft failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>And four of the 81 cases indicated graft rejection during follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Regardless of a high cumulative incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> (55/83; 66.2% grade II-IV; 47/83; 56.6% III-IV) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (50/83; 60.2%), in total, 77 patients showed durable engraftment and transfusion independence, and 64 are alive at a median time of 49 months with an overall survival rate of 66% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, this conditioning indicated well toleration, mild toxicity, durable engraftment, excellent survival as well as less cost </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Its application might shed new light on SAA at high risk of graft rejection in resource-limited countries </plain></SENT>
