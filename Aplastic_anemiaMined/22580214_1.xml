<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>From the genetic viewpoint, it has been reported a significant increase frequency of the human leukocyte antigen HLA-DRB1(∗)15 in patients with AA as compared to ethnically matched healthy controls, this is true in different populations worldwide, which would suggests that this allele participates in the immune regulation of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine gene frequencies of HLA-DRB1 alleles in Mexican mestizo patients with AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed and compared the HLA-DRB1 alleles in 36 Mexican mestizo patients (female gender, n=13; male gender, n=23) with AA to those present in 201 umbilical cord blood (UCB) samples as a control group, this was done by means of the polymerase chain reaction-single specific primer (PCR-SSP) technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Analysis of gene frequencies of HLA-DRB1(∗) alleles exhibits a significant increase of HLA-DRB1(∗)15 allele in the group of patients with AA as compared to those present in the control group (15.27% vs. 2.23%, respectively; p=1×10(-5); odds ratio [OR]=9.3; 95% confidence interval [95% CI]=3.2-27.8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed a positive association of the DRB1(∗)15 allele in Mexican patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, which coincides with that reported internationally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, we think that this allele was introduced to the Mexican population structure inherited from European ancestry </plain></SENT>
