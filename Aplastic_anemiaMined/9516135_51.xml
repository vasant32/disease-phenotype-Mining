<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>ATG treatment induces a major <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of peripheral blood lymphocytes, which contributes to its overall immunosuppressive effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Several mechanisms that may account for lymphocyte lysis were investigated in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At high concentrations (.1 to 1 mg/mL) ATGs activate the human classic complement pathway and induce lysis of both resting and phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At low, submitogenic, concentration ATGs induce antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity of PHA-activated cells, but not resting cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They also trigger surface Fas (Apo-1, CD95) expression in naive T cells and Fas-ligand gene and protein expression in both naive and primed T cells, resulting in Fas/Fas-L interaction-mediated cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>ATG-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and Fas-L expression were not observed with an ATG preparation lacking CD2 and CD3 antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Susceptibility to ATG-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was restricted to activated cells, dependent on IL-2, and prevented by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">Cyclosporin A</z:chebi>, FK506, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">rapamycin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The data suggest that low doses of ATGs could be clinically evaluated in treatments aiming at the selective deletion of in vivo activated T cells in order to avoid massive lymphocyte <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> and subsequent <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
