<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It has been previously demonstrated that dehydrochloramphenicol (DH-CAP), a <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> metabolite of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17698">chloramphenicol</z:chebi>, induces DNA single strand breaks in intact cells and is profoundly more cytotoxic than <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17698">chloramphenicol</z:chebi> (CAP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In view of previous observations relating genotoxicity of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35715">nitrocompounds</z:chebi> to their nitroreduction by the target tissue, we studied the nitroreduction of DH-CAP by human and rabbit bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nitroreduction by tissue homogenates was determined by the Bratton Marshall colorimetric assay and by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nitroreduction of DH-CAP by bone marrow cell homogenates was observed under aerobic conditions and the reduction was both cell concentration- and time-dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The formation of the amino product aminodehydrochloramphenicol was confirmed by HPLC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Reduction by other tissues including human liver, Raji cells, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60 tumors was also observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that genotoxicity of DH-CAP may be related to its nitroreduction by the target tissue with in situ production of toxic intermediates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Together with previous studies, these observations lend support to the thesis that the p-<z:chebi fb="4" ids="16301,29423,29424,29785,29786,33101">NO2</z:chebi> group may be the structural feature underlying <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> from CAP </plain></SENT>
