<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mean (+/- SD) serum EPO levels were 18.6 +/- 5.6 mU/ml in 180 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects and no sex difference was obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serum EPO levels in older subjects were slightly greater than those in younger subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was a negative correlation between serum EPO levels and Ht values in anemic patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> renal function, whereas serum EPO levels were within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range in anemic patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0851590" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal disorders</z:e>, suggesting that serum EPO levels were relatively low in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>chronic renal failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Serum EPO levels were rather increased in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000821'>hypothyroidism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>High serum EPO levels were obtained in patients with a variety of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0947743,C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematological disorders</z:e> such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> syndrome, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and pure red cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a patient with pure red cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> treated with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoids</z:chebi>, serum EPO levels were lowered before <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> was recovered and reticulocytes were increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that measurement of serum EPO levels are useful for not only differential diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> but also clinical evaluation of the treatment </plain></SENT>
