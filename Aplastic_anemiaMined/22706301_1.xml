<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We performed exome sequencing on two siblings who had no known pathogenic mutations for <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> and identified a mutation in the gene encoding the hematopoietic transcription factor GATA1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This mutation, which occurred at a splice site of the GATA1 gene, impaired production of the full-length form of the protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We further identified an additional patient carrying a distinct mutation at the same splice site of the GATA1 gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings provide insight into the pathogenesis of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi>, showing that the reduction in erythropoiesis associated with the disease can arise from causes other than defects in ribosomal protein genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results also illustrate the multifactorial role of GATA1 in human hematopoiesis </plain></SENT>
