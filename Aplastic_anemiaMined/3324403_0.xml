<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>28 patients had a HLA-identical sibling donor and were treated with bone marrow transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>72 patients without a HLA-identical sibling donor were given antilymphocyte globulin followed by oral low dose <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One and a half years to nine years after treatment 13 patients (46%) survive in the transplant group and 53 patients (74%) survive in the second group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> except one in the second group have self-sustaining hematopoiesis without need for transfusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There is one major difference between the two therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Marrow transplantation restores bone marrow function completely and no late hematological complications have been seen in this group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The majority of patients treated with antilymphocyte globulin in contrast have residual abnormalities of hemopoiesis: <z:mp ids='MP_0000248'>macrocytosis</z:mp>, mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001913'>granulocytopenia</z:hpo> and mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Relapse (11 of 72 patients) and clonal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0947743,C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematological disorders</z:e>, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0004818'>paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</z:hpo> (4 patients) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (one patient) can occur years after complete bone marrow reconstitution with antilymphocyte globulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These late disorders are of concern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In spite of this we conclude that antilymphocyte globulin treatment is an effective therapy with low early mortality and morbidity and a high chance for a long sustained remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Results are better or at least equivalent to bone marrow transplantation and patients with donors should be given the option of transplantation or antilymphocyte globulin </plain></SENT>
