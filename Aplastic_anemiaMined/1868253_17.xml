<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Monocyte dysfunction and decreased IL-1 production have been shown to be involved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="17594">Hydroquinone</z:chebi> (HQ), a toxic bone marrow (BM) metabolite of BZ, causes time- and concentration-dependent inhibition of processing of the 34-Kd pre-interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1 alpha) to the 17-Kd mature cytokine in murine P388D1 macrophages and BM stromal macrophages, as measured by Western immunoblots of cell lysate proteins using a polyclonal rabbit antimurine IL-1 alpha antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>HQ over a 10-fold concentration range had no effect on the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16412">lipopolysaccharide</z:chebi> (LPS)-induced production of pre-IL-1 alpha precursor or on cell viability or DNA and protein synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Stromal macrophages obtained from the femoral BM of C57Bl/6 mice exposed to BZ (600 or 800 mg/kg body weight) for 2 days were incapable of processing the 34-Kd pre-IL-1 alpha to the mature 17-Kd cytokine when stimulated in culture with LPS </plain></SENT>
