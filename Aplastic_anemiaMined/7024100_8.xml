<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tested this association by studying marrow specimens from 73 consecutive patients allografted for severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, 21 of whom rejected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Mast cell counts per unit area were performed on aspirate smears stained with Wright-Giemsa stain and on particle sections, clot sections, and biopsy specimens of marrow stained with toluidine blue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The ranges in both rejecting and nonrejecting patients with both methods were wide </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Smear counts were more variable and correlated poorly with section counts (correlation coefficient: +0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found no differences between rejecting and nonrejecting patients, either before or after grafting, with regard to mast cell counts in marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Also alterations in myeloid:erythroid ratios bore no detectable relationship to rejection </plain></SENT>
