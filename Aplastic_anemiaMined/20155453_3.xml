<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Many independent investigation groups have successfully isolated the pathopoiesis-associated T cell clone causing hematopoiesis failure with a CD4 phenotype from peripheral blood and bone marrow (BM) in AA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the current study, BM CD4(+) T cells were isolated from AA patients and healthy controls with immunomagnetic beads sorting, and proliferation capability, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> features and the impacts of their secreted cytokines on hematopoiesis stem/progenitor cells were compared between them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By (3)H-TdR method, CD4(+) T cells in AA group presented more enhanced proliferative activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The stimulation index in control group and AA group was 1.47+/-0.24, and 2.51+/-0.34 respectively (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After BM CD4(+) T cells were induced by high concentration of CD3 monoclonal antibody for 18 h, evident <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> cells could be seen under the electron microscope in both control group and AA group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometry revealed that <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> rates in the early and late stages of AA group were significantly higher than in control group (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Early-stage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> rate in control and AA groups was (6.85+/-1.48)% and (16.98+/-4.40)%, and late-stage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> rate in control group and AA group was (2.65+/-1.57)% and (7.74+/-0.83)%, respectively (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The CFU-GM count in AA group and control group was (74.50+/-9.50)/10(4) cells and (124.25+/-19.80)/10(4) cells respectively under an inverted microscope (P&lt;0.01), and the expression levels of CyclinD3 <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein in cord blood CD34(+) cells were both down-regulated induced by BM CD4(+) T cell culture supernatant in AA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that BM CD4(+) T cells of AA patients are likely in an abnormally proliferative, and activated state which can correlate intimately with AA hematopoiesis damage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>BM CD4(+) T cells in AA patients can secret some soluble cytokines that can inhibit proliferation of hematopoietic stem cells by suppressing the expression of Cyclin D3, resulting in hematopoiesis failure </plain></SENT>
