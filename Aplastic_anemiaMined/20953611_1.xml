<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study is to determine which single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in cytokine genes were relevant to AA risk and whether the relevant SNPs were associated with response to immunosuppressive therapy (IST) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among 84 screened patients, 80 patients confirmed as having acquired AA, and 84 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were analyzed consecutively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We genotyped ten polymorphisms in three cytokine genes (IFNG, TNF, and TGFB1) and FAS gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We assessed the association between polymorphisms and AA risk, and the association between polymorphisms and response to IST in three genetic models (dominant, recessive, and additive) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The IFNG -2,353 T allele (dominant model, OR = 0.43, p = .012) and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="30956">TCA</z:chebi> haplotype (dominant model, OR = 0.50, p = .038) were significantly associated with the development of AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, this relevant IFNG -2,353 T allele and <z:chebi fb="6" ids="30956">TCA</z:chebi> haplotype were related to the response of IST (dominant model, OR = 0.076, p = .034) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Concerning TGFB1, although its polymorphisms are not related to AA susceptibility, P10L T allele (recessive model, OR = 0.18, p = .038) and CT haplotype (dominant model, OR = 5.68, p = .038) were associated with response to IST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This exploratory study concurred with prior studies indicating that polymorphisms in IFNG are related to AA susceptibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, it was found that polymorphisms in IFNG and TGFB1 are associated with response to IST </plain></SENT>
