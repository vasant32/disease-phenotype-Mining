<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We examined cellular and functional characteristics of lpr and gld mutants on the C57BL/6 (B6) background </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Lymph node (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e>) cells from lpr and gld mice produced less <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> when coincubated with C.B10-H2(b)/LilMcd (C.B10) BM cells in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This functional difference was confirmed by infusing lpr, gld, and B6 <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e> cells into sublethally irradiated CB10 mice </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mice infused with gld <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e> cells developed mild to moderate BM failure despite receiving FasL-deficient effectors, thus suggesting the existence of alternative pathways or <z:hpo ids='HP_0003829'>incomplete penetrance</z:hpo> of the mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Paradoxically, mice that received Fas-deficient lpr <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e> cells also had reduced BM failure, likely due to down-regulation of proapoptotic genes, an effect that can be overcome by higher doses of lpr <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LN</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our model demonstrates that abnormal Fas or FasL expression interferes with the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> and marrow <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath>, validating a major role for the Fas/FasL cytotoxic pathway in immune-mediated BM failure, although disruption of this pathway does not completely abolish marrow destruction </plain></SENT>
