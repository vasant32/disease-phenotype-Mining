<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Serial studies of bone marrow (BM) hematopoiesis using clonogenic assays were performed in an infant with congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0004859'>amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Initially, when the only <z:hpo ids='HP_0001871'>hematological abnormality</z:hpo> was isolated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, the number of clonogenic BM hematopoietic progenitors was comparable to controls, including the number of megakaryocyte precursors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>As the disease evolved into <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> over an 11-month period, the peripheral blood counts declined, and colony numbers from four classes of BM progenitors--termed BFU-E, CFU-GM, CFU-Mix, and CFU-Meg--also declined in parallel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When added to the marrow cultures, patient's plasma was not inhibitory to either control or to patient's BM colony growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Similarly, no cellular inhibition of hematopoiesis was observed when patient's BM was cultured after depleting the sample of T lymphocytes and after adding the T lymphocytes back </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, stromal cells established from short-term and long-term cultures of patient's BM showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> proliferative activity and yielded a "fertile" marrow microenvironment for patient's and control BM colony growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that the central problem in congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0004859'>amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> is an intrinsic hematopoietic stem cell defect, rather than an abnormality of the marrow milieu </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The findings are consistent with either a progressive, quantitative attrition of progenitors or their inability to proliferate into colonies in vitro and into differentiated, functional cells in vivo </plain></SENT>
