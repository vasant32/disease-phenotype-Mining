<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Out of 59 patients with septic shock hospitalized at department for anesthesiology and reanimation, in 5 shock was arrested and they were transferred to other departments of the hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with failure of more than three organ systems, with SAPS score of 21 at admission, and a history of splenectomy died in the anesthesiology and reanimation department </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis of the underlying disease, resistance to chemotherapy administered, disease stage, persistent <z:mp ids='MP_0000334'>agranulocytosis</z:mp>, and artificial ventilation of the lungs which had to be resorted to did not influence the prognosis of septic shock </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Even after effective antishock therapy <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> died, as did the patients with resistance to chemotherapy administered for the underlying disease and those without signs of granulocytopoiesis recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hence, the prognosis is unfavorable for patients with septic shock in a state of <z:mp ids='MP_0000334'>agranulocytosis</z:mp>, if their SAPS score on admission is higher than 21, if they develop polyorgan failure with involvement of more than three organ systems, have a history of splenectomy, their hemoblastosis is resistant to chemotherapy, and there are no prospects for granulocytopoiesis recovery </plain></SENT>
