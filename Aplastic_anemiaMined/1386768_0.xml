<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Result: The OKT3, OKT4 and OKT4/OKT8 ratio in groups of Kidney-Yin Deficiency group were lower, while the OKT8 was higher than that of controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the group of both Kidney-Yin and Yang Deficiency, OKT4 and OKT4/OKT8 ratio were lower. and the value of OKT8 is higher than that of controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The OKT8 in the Kidney-Yang Deficiency group was higher. and the ratio of OKT4/OKT8 was lower than that of controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The OKT8 in the Kidney-Yin Deficiency group among three groups increased higher than that of other two groups. while the OKT4/OKT8 ratio reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The OKT4/OKT8 ratio in the group of both Kidney-Yin and Yang Deficiency was higher than that of Kidney-Yang Deficiency group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among the three groups, the rosette rates of RBC C3b receptor were lower than controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The above-mentioned data were statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These characteristic changes could be used as a reference of microcosmic Syndrome Differentiation and also a guide for how to apply the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressant</z:chebi> and immunopotentiator </plain></SENT>
