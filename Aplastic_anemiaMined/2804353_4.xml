<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Macrophages (MAC) are important effector cells of the immune system but also play an essential role as regulatory cells in hematopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They originate from circulating monocytes (MO) as immature precursor cells that undergo terminal differentiation upon migration from the capillary bed into the various tissues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the presence of serum, MAC maturation from blood MO is observed in vitro and can be followed by the expression of maturation-associated antigens (MAX.1, .3, .11, and .26; transferrin receptor, 13C2, CD16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have tested blood MO from 22 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) for their capacity to undergo terminal maturation in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After isolation, blood MO in six patients expressed CD14 molecules at low density when compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normals</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On culture for 7 days, in 15 patients various abnormalities could be shown by phenotype analysis using cell-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and an immunoperoxidase staining technique of single cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Abnormalities ranged from the distinctive failure of mature MAC to express single surface antigens (eg, gp64-MAX.1) to complete inhibition of the development of a MAC maturation-associated phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In three patients the maturational defect was found to persist in complete remission after successful therapy with antileukocyte globulin (ALG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Neither in other immunosuppressed or multiple-transfused patients nor in those with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow hypoplasia</z:hpo> secondary to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> chemotherapy and during hematologic reconstitution following autologous bone marrow transplantation (BMT), defective MO maturation in vitro was seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our data provide evidence for the existence of serious disorders within the MO-MAC lineage in patients with AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This observation may either reflect the stem-cell defect or indicate a MAC involvement in the pathogenesis of the disease </plain></SENT>
