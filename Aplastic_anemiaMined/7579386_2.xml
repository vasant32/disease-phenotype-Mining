<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the methylation status of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001417'>X-linked</z:hpo> gene phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK1) and the DXS 255 locus detected by probe M27 beta to study clonality in acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 30 females were suitable for clonal analysis of peripheral blood polymorphonuclear cells (PMN) and mononuclear cells using a polymerase chain reaction-based procedure in 24 patients and Southern blotting in 9 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Overall, 10 of 30 patients exhibited an imbalanced X-inactivation pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, in 4 patients, analysis of constitutional DNA suggested a skewed methylation pattern and 2 further cases had to be excluded because of the lack of an appropriate control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A truly clonal pattern was thus established in 4 of 30 (13%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 7 patients who later developed clonal disorders of hematopoiesis, X-inactivation analysis did not predict this event in any case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In patients with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0004818'>paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</z:hpo> phenotype, there was no correlation between the proportion of phosphatidylinositol glycan anchored protein (PIG-AP)-deficient blood cells and the corresponding X-inactivation pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>X-inactivation analysis detected clonal hematopoiesis in only 3 of 10 patients with a deficiency in PIG-AP in the cell population under study, but sorting of nucleated cells on the basis of PIG-AP expression showed the clonal nature of PIG-AP-deficient cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the majority of patients with AA show polyclonal hematopoiesis using <z:hpo ids='HP_0001417'>X-linked</z:hpo> clonal analysis, but that minor clonal populations, such as PIG-AP-deficient cells, may not be detected unless sorted cell populations are separately analyzed </plain></SENT>
