<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined the bone marrow of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (n = 33, mean age 49 years, age range 2-83 years) for the presence of hematogones and compared their frequency with that of age-matched controls (n = 50) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We found that the percentages of total and stage I hematogones were decreased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> at diagnosis (n = 25) and at follow-up post therapy (n = 8) when compared to age-matched controls (diagnosis, total: 0.29% vs. 0.87%, p = 0.001; diagnosis, stage I: 0.06% vs. 0.20%, p = 0.008; follow-up, total: 0.17% vs. 0.87%, p &lt; 0.001; follow-up, stage I: 0.04 vs. 0.20, p = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also found a significant decrease in the number of natural killer cells in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Further studies are warranted to elucidate the mechanism of hematogone decrease in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and whether this finding also applies to other myeloproliferative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
