<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To investigate whether the accelerated telomere shortening reported in Fanconi <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (FA) hematopoietic cells relates to a direct role of the FA pathway in telomere maintenance, we have analyzed telomere dynamics in Fancg-deficient mouse and human cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We show here that both hematopoietic (stem and differentiated bone marrow cells, B and T lymphocytes) and nonhematopoietic (germ cells, mouse embryonic fibroblasts [MEFs]) Fancg(-/-) mouse cells display <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> telomere length, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> telomerase activity, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> chromosome end-capping, even in the presence of extensive clastogen-induced cytogenetic instability (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="27504">mitomycin C</z:chebi> [<z:chebi fb="172" ids="27504">MMC</z:chebi>], gamma-radiation) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, telomerase-deficient MEFs with humanlike telomere length and decreased Fancg expression (G5 Terc(-/-)/Fancg shRNA3 MEFs) display <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> telomere maintenance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Finally, early-passage primary fibroblasts from patients with FA of complementation group G as well as primary human cells with reduced FANCG expression (FANCG shRNA IMR90 cells) show no signs of telomere dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our observations indicate that accelerated telomere shortening in patients with FA is not due to a role of FANCG at telomeres but instead may be secondary to the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that telomerase-based therapies could be useful prophylactic agents in FA <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> by preserving their telomere reserve in the context of the disease </plain></SENT>
