<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study was aimed to explore the gene expression profile characteristics of T lymphocytes involved in pathogenesis of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (SAA) and to predict putative curative drugs for SAA by using biological principle of similarity contrast of gene expression profiles between drugs and diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SAA and T lymphocyte were used as key words to search gene expression datasets related to pathogenesis of SAA in public Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) of NCBI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After significance test, gene expression profiling involved in pathogenesis of SAA were screened and applied to cluster analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>And then SAA-related gene expression profiles were thrown into pharmacological gene expression datasets of 3000 candidate drugs for similarity analysis and significantly negative correlation was used as a screening criterion for selecting putative curative drugs of SAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results showed that only one gene expression dataset was found out, i.e. GSE3807 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Computational bioanalysis identified a total of 515 candidate genes of T lymphocyte involved in pathogenesis of SAA, whose expression level exceeded more than 2-fold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among them, 202 genes were upregulated and 313 genes were downregulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cluster analysis showed that those genes belonged to different pathways, including nucleic acid metabolic process, ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process, Golgi apparatus protein transport, protein phosphorylation and immunoglobin/major histocompatibility complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Similarity analysis of gene expression profiles of SAA and drugs showed that hydroxycamptothecin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6801">metformin</z:chebi> might have a potential therapeutic efficacy on SAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that by means of novel bioinformatics method, gene expression profiling combined with similarity analysis between disease-related gene expression and pharmacological gene expression profiles may be a novel way of drug screening for SAA </plain></SENT>
