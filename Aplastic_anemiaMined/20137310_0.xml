<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventy-one childhood SAA patients treated with rabbit ATG + CsA as first line therapy were retrospectively analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seventy-one SAA patients, including 38 SAA and 33 very severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (VSAA), were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The median age was 12 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of these patients, 3 died within 3 months after the immunosuppressive therapy (IST) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The overall response rate was 67.6% (46/68) and the median time to transfusion independent was 53 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirty-three patients (48.5%) obtained remission in 3 months after the IST and 45 (67.2%) in 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The response rates were 57.7% (15/26), 56.5% (13/23) and 94.7% (18/19) for patients less than 10 years old, 10 - 15 year-old and 15 - 18 year-old, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Sixty patients suffered from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036830" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">serum sickness</z:e> on the IST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three patients relapsed and another 3 unrespond patients received retreatment of IST, and one patient progressed to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Rabbit ATG in combination with CsA as first line therapy for childhood SAA/VSAA can lead to overall response rate of 67.6% with minor adverse effects </plain></SENT>
