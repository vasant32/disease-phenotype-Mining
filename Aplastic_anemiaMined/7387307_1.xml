<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We describe a patient with a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> characterized by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> and an excess of myeloblasts in the bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>He had received massive doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41922">diethylstilbestrol</z:chebi> (150 mg daily) for seven years as therapy for prostatic <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although myelodyspoiesis has been associated with other drugs, a relationship to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50114">estrogen</z:chebi> therapy in man has not been reported previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the administration of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50114">estrogens</z:chebi> to animals has produced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> with a relative <z:mp ids='MP_0000220'>monocytosis</z:mp> and vacuolization of leukocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Examination of bone marroa, <z:hpo ids='HP_0012133'>erythroid hypoplasia</z:hpo>, and, with prolonged therapy, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Further animal studies have demonstrated that <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50114">estrogens</z:chebi> exert a suppressive effect on marrow stem cells and granuloid progenitor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These experimental observations suggest a possible role of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50114">estrogens</z:chebi> in the genesis of the hematologic changes we observed </plain></SENT>
