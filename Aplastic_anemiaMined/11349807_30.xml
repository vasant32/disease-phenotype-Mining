<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> who do not have suitably HLA-matched, related donors generally receive immunosuppressive treatment as first-line therapy and are considered for transplantation from an unrelated donor only if they fail to respond to immunosuppressive treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this setting, rates of transplantation-related morbidity and mortality have been high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We conducted a prospective study to determine the minimal dose of total body irradiation (TBI) sufficient to achieve sustained engraftment when it is used in combination with 3 cycles of 30 mg/kg of antithymocyte globulin (ATG) and 4 cycles of 50 mg/kg of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (CY) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We also wanted to determine the tolerability and toxicity of the regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The starting dosage of TBI was 3 x 200 cGy given over 2 days following CY/ATG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The TBI dose was to be escalated in increments of 200 cGy if graft failure occurred in the absence of prohibitive toxicity, and de-escalated for toxicity in the absence of graft failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one female and 29 male patients aged 1.3 to 46.5 years (median age, 14.4 years) underwent transplantation at 14 medical centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The time interval from diagnosis to transplantation was 2.8 to 264 months (median, 14.5 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had been transfused multiple times and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had received 1 to 11 courses (median, 4 courses) of immunosuppressive treatment and other modalities of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In 38 cases, the donors were HLA-A, -B and -DR phenotypically matched with the patients, and, in 12 cases, the donor phenotype differed from that of the recipient by 1 HLA antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Recipients of mismatched transplants were considered separately for TBI dose modification, and this study is still ongoing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Seven patients did not tolerate ATG and were prepared with 6 x 200 cGy of TBI plus 120 mg/kg of CY </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Of the HLA-matched recipients prepared with CY/ATG/TBI, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 20 who received 3 x 200 or 2 x 200 cGy of TBI achieved engraftment, and 10 are alive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Of the 13 patients who received 1 x 200 cGy of TBI, 1 failed to engraft, and 8 are alive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Each of 10 patients who received an HLA-nonidentical transplant achieved engraftment, and 3 of 6 who were given 3 x 200 cGy of TBI, and 4 of 4 who were given 2 x 200 cGy are alive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Pulmonary toxicity occurred in 8 of 30 patients who were given 3 x 200 or 2 x 200 cGy of TBI concurrently with ATG and CY at 200 mg/kg, and in 2 of 13 patients who received 1 x 200 cGy of TBI, a pattern that suggests a decrease in toxicity with TBI dose de-escalation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Overall, the highest probability of survival (73%) was observed among patients who underwent transplantation within 1 year of diagnosis, compared with patients who underwent transplantation after a longer period of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>In addition, younger patients (aged &lt; or = 20 years) were more likely to survive than older patients (aged &gt; 20 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Thus, for patients with an HLA-matched, unrelated donor, a TBI dose of 200 cGy (in combination with CY/ATG) was sufficient to allow for engraftment without inducing prohibitive toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>As in previous studies, patient age and pretransplantation disease duration remain important prognostic factors </plain></SENT>
