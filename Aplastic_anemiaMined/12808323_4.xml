<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two patients were treated by allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) from HLA identical sibling donors and 74 by immunosuppressive therapy (IS) with antithymocyte globulin (ATG) or antilymphocyte globulin (ALG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There was no statistical difference between the two treatment groups in age, sex, disease duration, and previous transfusion amount </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the BMT group, grade II-IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft versus host disease</z:e> (GVHD) developed in 10% and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD occurred in 33% of patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only one patient died from complication of transplantation (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948441" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="VOD">veno-occlusive disease</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of 74 patients who received IS treatment, 45% achieved a complete or partial response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients died among IS treatment group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Major causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> (40%) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> (55%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In the BMT group, the 5-yr overall survival (OS) was 95% after a median follow-up of 42 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the IS group, the 5-yr OS was 70% after a median follow-up of 49 months (p=0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the long-term survival rates of SAA in Koreans receiving BMT or IS were excellent compared with the Western data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further evaluation on the prognosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> in Asians should be done </plain></SENT>
