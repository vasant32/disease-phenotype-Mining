<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Tcf-1 gene regulates T cell development and function, and it is significantly upregulated in the bone marrow CD4(+) T cells from patients with acquired AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To explore the role of Tcf-1 in the pathogenesis of AA, we knocked down Tcf-1 gene in CD4(+) T cells of AA patients and studied the effects of Tcf-1 silencing on its downstream gene expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Upon transfection of psiRNA into marrow CD4(+) T cells from bone marrow of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> patients, the expression of Tcf-1 was significantly knocked down; consequently, expressions of c-Myc and CD44 were also significantly reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that Tcf-1 may contribute to pathogenesis of AA by regulating downstream gene expression such as c-myc and CD44 </plain></SENT>
