<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite the increasing interest in stem cells, surprisingly little is known about the number of times stem cells can or do divide over a lifetime </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Based on telomere-length measurements of hematopoietic cells, we previously proposed that the self-renewal capacity of hematopoietic stem cells is limited by progressive telomere attrition and that such cells divide very rapidly during the first year of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recent studies of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> resulting from inherited mutations in telomerase genes support the notion that the replicative potential of hematopoietic stem cells is directly related to telomere length, which is indirectly related to telomerase levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To revisit conclusions about stem cell turnover based on cross-sectional studies of telomere length, we performed a longitudinal study of telomere length in leukocytes from newborn baboons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> four individual animals studied showed a rapid decline in telomere length (approximately 2-3 kb) in granulocytes and lymphocytes in the first year after birth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After 50-70 weeks the telomere length appeared to stabilize in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cell types </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These observations suggest that hematopoietic stem cells, after an initial phase of rapid expansion, switch at around 1 year of age to a different functional mode characterized by a markedly decreased turnover rate </plain></SENT>
