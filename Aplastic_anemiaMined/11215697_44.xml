<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Enrolled were 94 consecutive patients, of whom 87 had received multiple transfusions and 38 had failed immunosuppressive therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Their ages ranged from 2 to 59 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After transplantation, 89 patients received a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> regimen for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) prevention </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">Cyclosporine</z:chebi> with or without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> was given in 4 patients, and no immunosuppression was given in 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ninety-six percent of patients had sustained grafts, whereas 4% rejected grafts between 2 and 7 months after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of the 4 rejecting patients, 3 are alive with successful second engraftments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> grade II GVHD was seen in 21% of patients, grade III in 7%, and grade IV in 1% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> GVHD was seen in 32% of patients, most of whom responded completely to immunosuppressive therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up of 6.0 years (range, 0.5-11.6 years), the survival rate was 88% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No unusual long-term side effects have been seen with the regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>/antithymocyte globulin regimen combined with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> after transplantation is well tolerated and effective in heavily pretreated patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
