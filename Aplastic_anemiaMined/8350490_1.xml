<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present report we have reviewed the clinical outcome of patients treated with BMT for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematological diseases</z:e> in Hokkaido </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fifty-eight allogeneic and 19 autologous transplants were registered by December 1991 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The underlying diseases consisted of 47 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo>, 14 <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, 10 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemias</z:hpo> and six <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among the allogeneic BMT cases, 55 were human leucocyte antigen (HLA) identical and three were mismatched </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among the autologous BMT patients, two received their marrow purged with 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide and five, with monoclonal antibodies and complements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The conditioning regimens used for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> were chiefly <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (CY) plus total body irradiation, or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi> plus CY </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In many cases, cytokines were used for rapid recovery of decreased leukocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Engraftment was observed in 50 out of 52 evaluated allogeneic and 18 out of 19 autologous transplants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Ten allogeneic patients suffered from severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host diseases</z:e> (GVHD), and extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD appeared in 16 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Relapses were observed in four cases of allogeneic BMT and six of autologous BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The major complications were <z:hpo ids='HP_0006515'>interstitial pneumonitis</z:hpo> (IP) and severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Long-term survival rates were almost 60% in both allogeneic and autologous transplants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD and limited <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD increased the survival rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The results indicated that substantial problems such as GVHD, IP and relapses must be controlled in the near future for an improved outcome to be made possible </plain></SENT>
