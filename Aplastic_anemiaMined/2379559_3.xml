<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Aa was the cause in 16 patients and 50 patients had different conditions explaining their <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo>, whereas in 34 patients no obvious explanation was found at the time of discovery of their <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A follow-up study in 1987 comprised the patients with Aa (n = 16) and the patients with uncharacterized <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> (n = 34.3 additional patients had then been diagnosed as having Aa whereas 3 patients had a diagnosis of a low-grade NHL and 8 patients a diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No (or an inadequate) bone marrow sample had been taken in 9 of the 34 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This study shows that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> may be found in many serious conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> should be carefully followed as Aa can develop slowly and as the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> diagnosis can be difficult to establish at an early stage </plain></SENT>
