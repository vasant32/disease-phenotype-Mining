<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: It is well known that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e> may cause multiple organ failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In chronically transfused patients, optimal iron chelation therapy is associated with reduced morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, chelation therapy has been associated with erythroid responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Among chronically transfused adults affected by myeloproliferative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> and treated with iron <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38161">chelators</z:chebi>, two case reports are described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: A male adult patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and a female adult with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA), both transfusion-dependent, were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49005">deferasirox</z:chebi>, an oral iron <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38161">chelator</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A significant reduction in transfusion requirement was observed and was dependent on chelation therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patient affected by AA also experienced a significant increase in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Minimal doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49005">deferasirox</z:chebi> maintained the erythroid responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Many mechanisms of action of the drug on erythropoiesis have been postulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The early erythroid response seems to be independent of the removal of iron from deposits, per se, since the reduction of ferritin levels (a surrogate marker of iron deposits) below threshold levels occurs as a later event </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Although there are few reports on erythroid responses in patients undergoing iron chelation therapy, they may give new insights in the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and other myeloproliferative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>AA may benefit in terms of erythroid response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The findings in these cases underline the clinical importance of treating patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>A survival benefit of chelation in patients with myeloproliferative <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> is still to be confirmed </plain></SENT>
