<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the long-term outcome of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> following allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT), and its relationship to hemopoietic chimerism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Three previously described patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> (RA) who underwent allogeneic BMT for therapy-related severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and 1 new patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003765'>psoriasis</z:hpo> who received BMT for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>) were followed up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Molecular studies were performed to assess hemopoietic and immune reconstitution in 3 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 2 of the RA patients, the RA remained in remission without treatment, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003680'>nonprogressive</z:hpo> disease, 11 and 13 years after BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The third patient with RA had a relapse 2 years after BMT, although the previously <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001807" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">aggressive disease</z:e> subsequently ran an attenuated course with treatment-free remission for the last 11 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Comparison with other cases of RA suggests that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> may influence the long-term outcome, perhaps through ongoing inhibition of the immune system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003765'>psoriasis</z:hpo>, BMT was followed by remission, but the psoriatic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015230" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rash</z:e> recurred and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003040'>arthropathy</z:hpo> developed 12 months later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0003765'>psoriasis</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003040'>arthropathy</z:hpo> remained active 4.5 years post-BMT, although the <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> remained in remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Molecular studies in the 2 patients whose RA remained in continued remission and in the patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003765'>psoriasis</z:hpo> that relapsed confirmed complete donor hemopoietic reconstitution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Long-term followup of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> after allogeneic transplantation confirmed cure of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> in some, but eventual relapse in others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of relapse despite complete donor hemopoietic reconstitution is evidence for the development of de novo, as opposed to persistent, disease, and is possibly related to intrinsic susceptibility of the transplanted stem cells or to host factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There may be a relationship between remission of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> and graft-versus-host reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These findings have relevance for the evolving application of stem cell transplantation as a therapy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
