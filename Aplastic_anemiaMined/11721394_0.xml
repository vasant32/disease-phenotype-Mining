<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the expression of membrane associated complement regulatory proteins (CRP)--CD55 and CD59 on the peripheral blood cells in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004818'>paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>(AA) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and its clinical implications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Expression of CD55 and CD59 on neutrophils, lymphocytes and erythrocytes was analyzed with flow cytometry, using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37926">FITC</z:chebi> and PE labeled anti-CD55 and CD59 monoclonal antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CD55 and CD59 expression on neutrophils was significantly decreased in 21 PNH patients (including 2 cases of AA-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> syndrome) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CD59- cells in neutrophils were constantly in excess of 10% in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Reduction in CD59 expression on erythrocytes was related to the severity of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CD55- neutrophils were also significantly increased in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> patients but with a greater variation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Expressions of CD55 and CD59 on neutrophils were remarkably decreased in 31 AA patients but to a less extent as compared to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No significant difference in the expressions of CD55 and CD59 was found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the 21 MDS patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Expression of CRP is reduced in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> and its related disorder-AA but remains unchanged in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometric analysis of complement regulatory proteins is of value in diagnosis and differential diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>, AA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In terms of diagnostic sensitivity and specificity, CD59 is superior to CD55, and neutrophil is superior to lymphocyte and erythrocyte </plain></SENT>
