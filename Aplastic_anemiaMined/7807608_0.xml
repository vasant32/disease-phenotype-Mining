<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrated that in aplastic mice, after treatment by Zaizhang-I, the loss of mature hematopoietic cells (WBC, RBC, Plt) were reduced, and marrow cellular cytosis, and their clinical findings were improved, indicating a partial remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present data show that its curative mechanism lies in the action of promoting the recovery of colony forming unit-spleen (CFU-S) and reversing immunologically-induced plasma colony forming unit granulocyte/macrophage (CFU-GM) inhibitory activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Natural killer cells activity (Nka) and interleukin-2, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factors (TNF) were also so examined to further understand the mechanism by which Zaizhang-I reverse plasma hematopoietic activity </plain></SENT>
