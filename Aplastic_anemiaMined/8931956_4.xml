<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Mice harboring the "<z:mp ids='MP_0002938'>white spotting</z:mp>" (W) locus have abnormalities in hematopoiesis due to one of various mutations of the c-kit proto-oncogene, which encodes the stem cell factor (SCF) receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The c-kit mutations identified in W mice cause diminished, absent or dominant negative receptor function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study explores the hypothesis that acquired mutations of c-kit in the hematopoietic stem cell participate in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Genomic DNA was prepared from granulocytes and monocytes of 11 patients with acquired AA and one patient with a non-Fanconi's form of inherited AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DNA was subjected to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and single-stranded conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 21 exons of the c-kit gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two patients were heterozygous for a previously described polymorphism involving exon 17 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two other patient samples had an extra band on SSCP analysis of exon 10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DNA extracted from epithelial cells of one patient revealed the same SSCP pattern as that from the blood cells, suggesting that the alteration was in the germ-line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>PCR-SSCP analysis of leukocyte DNA from 12 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals revealed that 2 samples also had an extra band in exon 10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DNA sequencing of PCR-amplified and cloned DNA from the patients and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals with the aberrant SSCP results showed them <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> to be heterozygous for an ATG to CTG transition in codon 541, resulting in substitution of methionine by leucine in the transmembrane region of the protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The same two patients and two controls were heterozygous for a silent change in codon 862 (exon 18) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Matching serum samples from 4 of 6 AA patients tested had SCF levels more than two standard deviations above the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mean value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that neither c-kit mutations nor decreased soluble SCF levels are commonly involved in the pathogenesis of acquired AA </plain></SENT>
