<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To clarify the significance of GPI-AP(-) T cells in BMF, peripheral blood from 562 patients was examined for the presence of CD48(-) CD59(-) CD3(+) cells using high-resolution flow cytometry (FCM), and the GPI-AP(-) T cells were characterized with regard to their phenotype and sensitivity to inhibitory molecules, including herpesvirus entry mediator (HVEM) and a myelosuppressive cytokine, TGF-β </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A multi-lineage FCM analysis detected CD48(-) CD59(-) CD3(+) T cells in 72 (12.8%) of the patients, together with GPI-AP(-) myeloid cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Unexpectedly, 12 patients (10 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and 2 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>-<z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo>, 2.1%), who showed clinical features similar to those of other BMF patients with GPI-AP(-) myeloid cells, such as a good response to immunosuppressive therapy, displayed 0.01-0.3% GPI-AP(-) cells exclusively in T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The CD48(-) CD59(-) T cells consisted of predominantly effector memory (EM) and terminal effector cells, while CD48(-) CD59(-) T cells from non-BMF patients who had received anti-CD52 antibody only showed EM and central memory phenotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>TGF-β and HVEM capable of inhibiting T-cell proliferation via its GPI-AP CD160 ligation suppressed the in vitro proliferation of GPI-AP(+) T cells more potently than that of GPI-AP(-) T cells from the same patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The presence of GPI-AP(-) T cells, as well as GPI-AP(-) myeloid cells, may therefore reflect the immunopathophysiology of BMF in which cytokine-mediated suppression of hematopoietic stem cells via GPI-AP-type receptors takes place </plain></SENT>
