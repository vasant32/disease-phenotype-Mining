<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow (BM) failure associated with cytomegalovirus (CMV) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> is a feared complication after clinical BM transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Experiments in long-term BM cultures have indicated that BM stromal cells (BMSC) are targets of productive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010823" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">CMV infection</z:e>, but an in situ <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> of BM stroma remained to be documented, and the pathomechanism is open to question </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we describe a murine in vivo model of lethal CMV <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (CMV-AA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The reconstitution of hematopoietic progenitor cells expressing stem cell factor (SCF) receptor was found to be defective in CMV-AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>While murine CMV replication in permissive parenchymal tissues is cytolytic, the hematopoietic cord was found to be a site of very limited virus production with foci of reticular BMSC expressing the intranuclear <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> IE1 protein, but with only a few BMSC positive for <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> genome in the in situ hybridization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>XX-XY BM chimeras were established in order to quantitate Y-chromosome-tagged BMSC by a PCR specific for the male-sex-determining gene Tdy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This approach revealed that murine <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010823" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">CMV infection</z:e> is not associated with a significant loss of BMSC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Despite the physical integrity of the stromal network, the functional integrity of the stroma was impaired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>While housekeeping genes were expressed normally in BMSC of infected mice, the expression of genes encoding the essential hemopoietins SCF, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, and interleukin-6 was markedly reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the mechanism of BM failure is not a stromal lesion but an insufficient stromal function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings explain CMV-AA as a manifestation of multiple hemopoietin deficiency </plain></SENT>
