<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The activity capable of promoting the growth of human erythroid burst-forming cells (BFU-E) in culture was measured in the sera from 39 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) and compared with similar activity in patients with various other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521860" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic disorders</z:e> and 31 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Burst-promoting activity (BPA) was determined by its ability to support erythroid burst growth from adherent cell-depleted <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human marrow cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results were expressed as the percentage of burst growth supported by test serum compared with cultures established in the presence of 20% test serum and 2.5% phytohemagglutinin-stimulated lymphocyte conditioned medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The mean BPA level in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> serum was 18.5% (1.5 +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) and was not significantly different from BPA levels in patients with various forms of nonhypoplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001901'>polycythemia</z:hpo> (10.2% +/- 1.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, 15 of the 39 patients with AA had elevated BPA levels, ranging from 40.0% to 106.0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These elevated levels did not correlate with serum erythropoietin or hematocrit values, white blood cell count, platelet count, time from diagnosis, or the presence or numbers of BFU-E in circulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The BPA was shown not to be T cell growth factor (interleukin-2), and the effect was not blocked by the addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> to culture, consistent with a direct effect of this activity on BFU-E </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When the 39 patients with AA were treated with antithymocyte globulin, 20 obtained a complete or partial remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>BPA levels determined from sera obtained before treatment did not correlate with response or duration of survival but did correlate with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating activity (GM-CSA).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
