<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To demonstrate the autoimmune origin of some cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, we have studied the effect of antilymphocyte globulin (ALG) on the hematopoiesis of aplastic patients by serial hematological and bone marrow investigation including blood counts, bone marrow cellularity, scanning with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30430">indium</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="33353">technetium</z:chebi> and granulocytic colonies in agar, 8 out of 17 patients had a response to ALG as shown by a rise of granulocytes and reticulocytes counts, increase of bone marrow cellularity and number of granulocytic colonies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study tends to show that ALG has a stimulating effect on hematopoiesis in some cases of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
