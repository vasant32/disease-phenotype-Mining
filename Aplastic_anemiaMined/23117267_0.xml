<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: This is a retrospective study of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011974'>myelofibrosis</z:hpo> admitted to inpatient rehabilitation at a tertiary referral-based <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> center between January 1, 2005, and April 10, 2012 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Items analyzed from patient records included return to the primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> care service with demographic information, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> characteristics, medications, hospital admission characteristics, and laboratory values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two hundred twenty-five patients were admitted a total of 255 times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ninety-three (37%) of the 255 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> inpatient rehabilitation admissions returned to the primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> care service </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eighteen (19%) and 42 (45%) of the 93 patients died in the hospital and were discharged home, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Statistically significant factors (P &lt; 0.05) associated with return to the primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> care service include peripheral blast percentage and the presence of an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35718">antifungal agent</z:chebi> on the day of the inpatient rehabilitation transfer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Using additional two factors (platelet count and the presence of an <z:chebi fb="1" ids="22587">antiviral agent</z:chebi>, both P &lt; 0.11), the Return to Primary-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>Leukemia</z:hpo> Index was formulated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> with the presence of circulating peripheral blasts and/or an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35718">antifungal agent</z:chebi> may be at increased risk for return to the primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> care service </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The Return to Primary-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>Leukemia</z:hpo> Index should be tested in prospective studies to determine its usefulness </plain></SENT>
