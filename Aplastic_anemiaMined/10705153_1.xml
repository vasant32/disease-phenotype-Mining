<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, disease-dependent mortality was high before allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) and immunosuppressive therapies (IST) including antilymphocyte globulin became available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, under supportive therapy alone, spontaneous remissions were observed in up to 20% of severe cases, reflecting the natural course of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, in evaluating new forms of treatment, one has to keep in mind that remission is not necessarily response, and that final proof of utility of any new therapy still requires a randomized study design </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transition to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> was rarely observed if the initial diagnosis was accurate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The much higher incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> in patients treated by IST, but not by BMT is probably due to the better life expectancy of patients at risk, rather than to a leukemogenic potential of IST itself. 'Outdated' therapeutic modalities, such as <z:chebi fb="5" ids="50113">androgens</z:chebi> or splenectomy, may still be justified as an adjuvant therapy in selected cases </plain></SENT>
