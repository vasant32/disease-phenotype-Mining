<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the reaction of cytokines induced killer (CIK) cells treatment in hematopoietic injury at different levels on patients with <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> poisoning and seek a novel, safe and effective immunotherapy for <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> poisoning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: CIK cells were in vitro activated by interleukin-2 (IL-2) and granulocyte-macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-two patients with <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> poisoning were treated with CIK cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nineteen patients with mild or moderate <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> poisoning in the control group were treated with VitB4, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34117">batilol</z:chebi>, leucogen, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17596">inosine</z:chebi> and stanozolol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results for treatment of 12 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> induced by severe <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> poisoning (the efficacy rate and the case fatality rate) were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The change of T-lymphocyte subset analyzed by flow cytometry was also observed before and after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: For mild or moderate <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> poisoning, the increase of WBC and RLT in CIK group was higher than that in the control group (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The CD(4)/CD(8) levels were significantly increased after CIK treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>And for severe <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> poisoning, the effective rate of the CIK group was 91.7% and the mortality rate was 0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CIK treatment is safe and effective for hematopoietic injury caused by <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> poisoning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The mechanism may be related with the immune modulation of CIK treatment on <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> of patients with <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> poisoning </plain></SENT>
