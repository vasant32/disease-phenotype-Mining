<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied the feasibility and the sensitivity of fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) using leukemic or host/donor-specific probes on flow-sorted cells to assess <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242596" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MRD">minimal residual disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e>) or chimerism in transplanted patients in complete remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We first performed experimental models of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> and chimerism by mixing HL60 cells and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> lymphocytes in different proportions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Over 80% HL60 cells were obtained from mixtures of 5% HL60 cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We then evaluated <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e> and mixed chimerism in a <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> patient in relapse after allogeneic sex-mismatched bone marrow transplantation (BMT), who had received a donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three months after DLI, mixed chimerism was observed in each bone marrow (BM)-sorted lineage (CD13+, CD14+, CD20+, and CD3+), with the highest level of recipient cells in the granulocytic lineage (CD13+) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five months after DLI, host cells were at a low level but remained detectable in the granulocytic lineage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the same sample, the bcr-abl gene was detected in the granulocytic lineage and not in the lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We also studied chimerism in an <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> sex-mismatched transplanted female patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We determined the proportion of recipient total lymphocytes, CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes, and CD14+ monocytes under <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> therapy on five peripheral blood samples and one BM sample over 5 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Results showed a regular decrease in recipient total lymphocytes (26.6% to 10.6%) and monocytes (20.7% to 8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CD8(+)-recipient cells decreased rapidly, while CD4+ remained stable (17%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This work demonstrates the feasibility of FISH after cell sorting, combining the sensitivities of both flow cytometry and FISH and the specificities of both immunophenotyping and genotype analysis </plain></SENT>
