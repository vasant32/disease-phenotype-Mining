<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Each immune-mediated AA mouse was intraperitoneally injected with 5 mg ligustrazine twice a day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On the 14th day, expressions of CD49d and CD49c in bone marrow mononuclear cells(MNC) were detected by flow cytometry, and VCAM-1 on stromal cells by immunohistochemistry SABC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Expressions of CD49d, CD49e and VCAM-1 were significantly lower in AA group than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> group(t = 11.96, 17.18 and 7.09 respectively, P &lt; 0.001), and were much higher in ligustrazine treated group than in non-treated group(t = 9.05, 14.61 and 6.91 respctively, P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Expressions of CD49d and VCAM-1 were in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range in ligustrazine group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Ligustrazine can increase the expression of adherent molecule of bone marrow cells in immune-mediated AA mice, thus promote the growth of hematopoietic cells </plain></SENT>
