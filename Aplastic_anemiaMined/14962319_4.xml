<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The prevalence of GB virus C (GBV-C)/HGV is high in individuals with parenteral risk factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The frequency of GBV-C/HGV in blood donors is significantly lower, however it is still far above other parenterally transmitted viruses like HBV and HCV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, transmission routes apart from parenteral transmission must be considered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The purpose of the study was to evaluate the prevalence of GBV-C/HGV in blood donors and relatives of GBV-C/HGV-positive and -negative blood donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Prevalence was also analyzed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Samples were tested by RT-PCR and partially by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Positive isolates were sequenced and phylogenetically analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 5733 blood donors were PCR tested and 90 were positive (1.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Of these, 98 relatives could be tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042749" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Viremia</z:e> was found in 14.3 percent and anti-E2 in 29.5 percent, whereas only 1.1 percent of the relatives of PCR-negative donors were viremic and 8.5 percent were anti-E2 positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Probable virus transmission could be shown in two couples and in six mother-child pairs by sequencing of isolates indicating horizontal and vertical virus transmission, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Recipients of GBV-C/HGV <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>-positive blood products were shown to be infected at a rate of 58 percent (18/31) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>Aplastic anemia</z:hpo> patients were positive at a rate of 32 percent (17/53) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The high percentage of 14.3 percent of GBV-C/HGV PCR-positive relatives of GBV-C/HGV-positive blood donors suggests intrafamilial transmission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Sequence analyses revealed vertical and horizontal transmission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Although parenteral transmission is highly efficient for GBV-C/HGV (58% of recipients of GBV-C/HGV <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi>-positive blood products and 32% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> patients), it appears that sexual and vertical transmission are the most common transmission routes </plain></SENT>
