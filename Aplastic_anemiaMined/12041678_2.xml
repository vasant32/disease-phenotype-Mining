<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The receptor for urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPAR) also is attached to the cell membrane by a GPI anchor, and that soluble uPAR (suPAR) is present in plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we measured uPAR, CD55, and CD59 on granulocytes by means of flow cytometry and suPAR in plasma by means of immunoradiometric assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The subjects were 20 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>, 59 other patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, and 21 healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>, both the mean fluorescence intensity and the positive percentage of fluorescence-activated granulocytes of uPAR, CD55, and CD59 were remarkably decreased, whereas in patients with other forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, except 2 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, the results were not altered in comparison with those for the healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The level of uPAR was reduced to the same extent as were those of CD55 and CD59 on the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>-affected granulocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Some peak shape abnormalities (double peaks, peak tailing, or both) in the histogram of fluorescence intensity were also found in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The suPAR concentration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> plasma was 4.04+/-2.47 ng/mL, which was higher than that of the healthy individuals, 1.73+/-0.96 ng/mL (P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The positive percentage of fluorescence-activated granulocytes was inversely associated with the plasma suPAR level in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> (r = -0.79, P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that measurement of uPAR on granulocytes by means of flow cytometry and of suPAR in plasma by means of immunoradiometric assay are specific techniques for the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
