<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied the effects of several cytokines on the development of granulocyte-macrophage (GM) progenitors using the serum-deprived culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SCF plays an important role in the GM-CSF- or IL-3-dependent production of neutrophils and macrophages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In vitro colony assay also suggests an increase in sensitivity of GM progenitors to cytokines (GM-CSF, IL-3, G-CSF and/or SCF) in a patient with juvenile <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A high level of serum IFN-gamma was associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001882'>leukopenia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> in a patient with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_654'>hemophagocytic syndrome</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Based on the evidence that IFN-gamma significantly inhibited the proliferation of GM progenitors, IFN-gamma-mediated suppression was suggested as one of the mechanisms causing cytopenia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo>, an increase of serum G-CSF levels was observed when neutrophils decreased remarkably in number </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the serum SCF levels were constant in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A failure of SCF to enhance colony growth in some patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> implies qualitative abnormalities of hematopoietic progenitors </plain></SENT>
