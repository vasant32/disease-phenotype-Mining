<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Median number of transfusions was 16 (range, 3-886) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For post-transplant immunosuppression <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were given <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> and the last three patients received additional immunosuppression with short-term <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
