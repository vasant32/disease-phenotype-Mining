<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It has been reported that bone marrow and serum of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorders</z:hpo> contain an abnormal concentration of cytokines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we tried to isolate mouse bone marrow stromal cell lines that were stably transformed with a variety of cytokine genes and that expressed them constitutively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>From mouse bone marrow stromal cell lines MBA-1, MBA-13, and 14F1.1, we isolated clones secreting interleukin-3 (IL-3), IL-4, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), or granulocyte (G)-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)-producing stable transformants could not be established from 14F1.1 cells in spite of repeated transfection trials </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At early stages of transfection, 14F1.1 cells did secrete IFN-gamma; however, exogenously added mouse IFN-gamma could not inhibit 14F1.1 cell growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We discovered that chromosomal DNA isolated from 14F1.1 after transfection with the mouse IFN-gamma gene was fragmented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This is characteristic of cells undergoing apoptotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>DNA fragmentation was also observed in 14F1.1 cells transfected with the human IFN-gamma gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that intracellular IFN-gamma induces apoptotic cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of 14F1.1 stromal cells </plain></SENT>
