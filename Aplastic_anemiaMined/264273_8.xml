<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Adequate specimens were obtained in 85% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Results of cellularity estimated by biopsy were compared to the cellularity of the aspirate versus volumetric determination of the myeloid-erythroid layer (buffy coat) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A wide discrepancy was noted between marrow cellularity confirmed by biopsy versus the aspirate or buffy coat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The greatest variance was seen in the hypercellular or normocellular marrows, as estimated by biopsy, in which 39% were misinterpreted as moderately or severely hypocellular by aspirate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Volumetric measurement of buffy coat was least acceptable for estimating cellularity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus the biopsy has proved to be an important and reliable indicator of bone marrow cellularity </plain></SENT>
