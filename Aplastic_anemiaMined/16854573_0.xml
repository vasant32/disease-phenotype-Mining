<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: A 19-year-old girl, issued from a third degree consanguineous marriage, was admitted because of anemic and hemorrhagic syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Physical examination showed several malformations: microphtalmia, brownish spots, <z:hpo ids='HP_0007440'>generalized hyperpigmentation</z:hpo> and ungueal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_554'>dystrophy</z:mpath> without mucosal leucoplasia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Statural and ponderal retardation were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the hemogram there was a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> and on biopsy, the bone marrow was desertic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The caryotype performed on peripheral blood lymphocytes after sensibilisation with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27504">mitomycin C</z:chebi> revealed <z:mp ids='MP_0008866'>chromosomal instability</z:mp> aspects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Based on these clinical and biological features, the diagnosis of hereditary aplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> was retained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patient was given norethandrolone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>She died 3 months later by septic shock </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Coexistence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> with a malformative syndrome suggests most probably an hereditary form of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Fanconi <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> is the most frequent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It associates characteristic anomalies of the face, with microphtalmia, brownish spots, statural and ponderal retardation, and thumb anomalies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Ungueal <z:mpath ids='MPATH_554'>dystrophy</z:mpath>, mucosal leucoplasia are almost pathognomonic of congenital <z:mp ids='MP_0009563'>dyskeratosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>When the malformative syndrome is not characteristic, the cytogenetic study may also fail to make the differential diagnosis, as was the situation in our case </plain></SENT>
