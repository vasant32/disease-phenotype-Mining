<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, failure to respond, delayed responses, partial responses, relapses and early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> remain significant problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to test whether a higher dose of G-CSF (10 micro g/kg/day) would reduce these complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a multicenter prospective trial in 77 SAA patients treated with horse ALG (15 mg/kg/day day1-5) and CyA (5 mg/kg/day day 1-180) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients were randomized to receive G-CSF 5 micro g/kg/day (n=38, group A) or 10 micro g/kg/day (n=39, group B) from day +1 to day +30 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients then received G-CSF 5 micro g/kg/day from day +31 to day +90 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The primary end point of this study was response at day +120 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Secondary end points were early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, blood counts at day +120, and survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At day +120 responses were classified as absent, partial, and complete in 12, 22, and 4 patients in group A and in 23, 7, and 9 patients in group B (p=0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At last follow-up these figures were respectively 9, 12, and 17 vs 19, 2, and 18 (p=0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients (5 in group A and 8 in group B) died before day 120 (p=0.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Median peripheral blood counts on day 120 were comparable in the two groups: Hb 10.5 and 9.5 g/dL in group A and B, respectively (p=0.6), Neutrophil counts were 2.4 vs 1.9x10(9)/L in groups A and B (p=0.4) and platelet counts were, respectively, 42 vs 36x10(9)/L (p=0.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The actuarial survival at 4 years is 72% in group A and 67% in group B (p=0.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Increasing the dose of G-CSF does not appear to reduce early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, does not improve peripheral blood counts nor survival, and may reduce the response rate in patients with SAA receiving ALG and CyA </plain></SENT>
