<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three patients with pure red cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> responded to plasmapheresis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One patient with atypical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> showed partial recovery following lymphocyte <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath>; the other five patients showed no evidence of a clinical response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effect of patients' sera or bone marrow on formation of myeloid or erythroid colonies by bone marrow from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals was determined in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A decline in serum inhibition of erythroid colony formation was observed in the patients with pure red cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> following treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Any changes in serum inhibition were less marked or unrelated to treatment outcome in the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, although the single patient who responded to lymphocyte <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> exhibited reversal of coculture bone marrow inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our experience suggests that in vitro assay methods may not adequately predict the response of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> to this form of immunotherapy, and furthermore clinical improvement was too <z:hpo ids='HP_0003745'>sporadic</z:hpo> for this treatment to be recommended </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Plasmapheresis may be a useful adjunct in patients with pure red cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath>, but remissions may not be dramatic or sustained </plain></SENT>
