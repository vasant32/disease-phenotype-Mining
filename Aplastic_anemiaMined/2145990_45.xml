<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0004818'>Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>) is a disease that affects not only red cells, but other blood cells as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The common defect is supposed to be an acquired deficiency of glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored membrane proteins, which may be present already at the hematopoietic stem cell level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, a panel of monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) has become available directed against various GPI-linked membrane proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This makes it possible to study various cell lineages for the deficiency of such proteins in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> in more detail </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using cytofluorography, we could show that the granulocytes of 20 different <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> patients miss not only GPI-linked FcRIII (CD16 antigen), but also three other GPI-linked proteins, ie, CD24 antigen, CD67 antigen and a granulocyte-specific 50 to 80 Kd antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The affected granulocytes were not only neutrophils but also eosinophils, as was found in a more detailed analysis of three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover, in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 10 PNH patients tested, the monocytes were found to be deficient for the GPI-linked CD14 antigen, and we found with CD24 and CD55 (DAF) antibodies that lymphocytes may be involved as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, abnormal B and T lymphocytes were detected only in a subset of patients (2 of 10 tested) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The uniform deficiency of GPI-linked proteins of granulocytes allows the introduction of a new diagnostic cytofluorometric assay for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> with MoAbs against GPI-linked granulocytic antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This test was positive in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> patients studied and not in a group of 40 control patients or 50 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> donors, with the exception of three of 16 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In the three AA patients, subpopulations (10% to 20%) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> granulocytes could be detected, whereas these patients had a negative acidified serum (Ham) test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This indicates that the new test is more sensitive than the Ham test and allows the early diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> in AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>An advantage of the neutrophil assay is that, in contrast to the Ham test, it is not influenced by recent red-cell transfusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Moreover, it is possible to quantify the number of affected cells by single cell analysis </plain></SENT>
