<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied the degree and the pattern of skewing of the variable region of beta-chain (VB) T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) at initial presentation and after immunosuppression using a high-resolution analysis of the TCR VB complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Age-matched healthy individuals and multitransfused patients with non-immune-mediated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic diseases</z:e> were used as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In newly diagnosed AA, the average frequency of CDR3 size distribution deviation indicative of oligoclonal T-cell proliferation was increased (44% +/- 33% vs 9% +/- 9%; P =.0001); AA patients with human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR2 and those with expanded <z:hpo ids='HP_0004818'>paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</z:hpo> clones showed more skewed VB repertoires </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nonrandom oligoclonal patterns were found for VB6, VB14-16, VB21, VB23, and VB24 subfamilies in more than 50%, and for VB15, VB21, and VB24 in more than 70% of AA patients with HLA-DR2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients received immunosuppression with antithymocyte globulin (ATG)/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> (CsA) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="3498">CTX</z:chebi>) with CsA in combination, and their VB repertoire was reanalyzed after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Whereas no significant change in the degree of VB skewing in patients who had received ATG was seen, patients treated with <z:chebi fb="3" ids="3498">CTX</z:chebi> showed a much higher extent of oligoclonality within <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> VB families, consistent with a profound and long-lasting contraction of the T-cell repertoire </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>VB analysis did not correlate with the lymphocyte count prior to lymphocytotoxic therapy; however, after therapy the degree of VB skewing was highly reflective of the decrease in lymphocyte numbers, suggesting iatrogenic gaps in the VB repertoire rather than the emergence of clonal dominance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data indicate that multiple specific clones mediate the immune process in AA </plain></SENT>
