<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of these, 125 cases of marrow basophilia (5.9% incidence) and 63 cases of peripheral basophilia (3.0% incidence) were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were 33 patients with simultaneous marrow and peripheral basophilia, which was only significantly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (24 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Isolated peripheral basophilia was rarely seen (30 patients, 1.4% incidence) and it did not reflect any significant pathologic association </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Marrow basophilia was significantly present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorders</z:hpo>, idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo>, certain erythrocyte disorders, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001891'>iron deficiency anemia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The incidence of marrow basophilia in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo>, or solid <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp> was not significantly different from what it would be as a chance occurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest that marrow basophilia is a specific, but not sensitive, marker of myeloproliferative and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026986" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="MDS">dysmyelopoietic syndromes</z:e> </plain></SENT>
