<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of the present study was to assess the proportion of FA cases among <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) in Tunisian pediatric patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBSERVATION:: Investigation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27504">mitomycin C</z:chebi>-induced chromosomal breakage was carried out in 163 pediatric patients with AA and siblings of the cases where diagnosis of FA was confirmed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We identified 31 patients with FA whose percentage of unstable mitoses ranges from 65% to 100% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among 18 siblings who were investigated for <z:mp ids='MP_0008866'>chromosomal instability</z:mp>, 3 were incidentally found to be affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS:: FA is an important cause of AA in Tunisia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our report is the first study in North Africa that explored cytogenetic and phenotypic findings in FA children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It also showed the importance of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27504">mitomycin C</z:chebi> sensitivity screening in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> FA siblings </plain></SENT>
