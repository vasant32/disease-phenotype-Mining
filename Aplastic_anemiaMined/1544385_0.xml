<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This was achieved using a recombinant granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rGM-CSF)-stimulated myeloid cell colony formation (granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming cells, GM-CFC) assay as well as a recombinant erythropoietin (rEpo)-stimulated erythroid burst formation (erythroid burst-forming units, BFU-E) assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cells were obtained from bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB) of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> healthy donors and from patients with suppressed bone marrows </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The latter group included <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> patients and patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> who responded to intensive chemotherapy with significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="6" ids="20506,26911">THF</z:chebi> gamma 2 significantly enhanced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> BM and PB GM-CFC and PB BFU-E by 2- to 2.5-fold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This effect was totally dependent on the presence of the respective growth factors, that is, rGM-CSF or rEpo, and was specifically reversed by an anti-<z:chebi fb="6" ids="20506,26911">THF</z:chebi> gamma 2 antiserum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, although <z:chebi fb="6" ids="20506,26911">THF</z:chebi> gamma 2-induced enhancement of GM-CFC colony formation was not affected by lymphocyte or monocyte <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath>, the augmenting effect of the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> on BFU-E was completely abrogated in the <z:mp ids='MP_0000726'>absence of lymphocytes</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="6" ids="20506,26911">THF</z:chebi> gamma 2-induced augmented growth of progenitor cells derived from severely suppressed marrows was minimal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, cells from moderately neutropenic patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> in remission or with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> under chemotherapy responded to the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> similarly to cells from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest a stimulatory role for <z:chebi fb="6" ids="20506,26911">THF</z:chebi> gamma 2 on human myeloid and erythroid hematopoietic progenitor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>They also suggest the lymphocyte dependence of BFU-E enhancement and lymphocyte independence of GM-CFC stimulation by <z:chebi fb="6" ids="20506,26911">THF</z:chebi> gamma 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In the former case the thymus-derived <z:chebi fb="7" ids="16670">peptide</z:chebi> may act through the induction of certain erythroid-enhancing lymphokines </plain></SENT>
