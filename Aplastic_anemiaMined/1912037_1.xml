<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Thirty-three patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> were treated with antilymphocyte globulin (ALG, MÃ©rieux) and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="50113">androgens</z:chebi> (with or without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi>) between 1981 and 1989; 24 patients (72.7%) were responders after one course of ALG, eight were nonresponders, and only one patient had an early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eighteen of the 24 responses occurred within 2 months of ALG treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of note is the good response rate we obtained for very severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (four responders of five evaluable patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up of 36 months (range 1-97), a survival rate of 77.6% +/- 1.2% was obtained at 30 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No predictive factor of survival could be identified except response to treatment (p = 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The duration of the disease before treatment was inversely related to survival, although this difference did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four initial responders relapsed after 14, 24, 38, and 57 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three of these patients received a second course of ALG and two responded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, four of the non-responders received a second course of ALG, with only one response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Toxicity of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="50113">androgens</z:chebi> was mild </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No patient developed a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> clone or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Major toxicity of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> was femoral <z:hpo ids='HP_0010885'>osteonecrosis</z:hpo> in three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In our experience, the combination of ALG and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="50113">androgens</z:chebi> in SAA, with or without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi>, was associated with a higher response rate and better survival than in many previously published reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This could have been due to the intensive supportive care during the initial weeks of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>We suggest that it may also result from the addition of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="50113">androgens</z:chebi> to ALG, although this issue may only be resolved in a randomized study </plain></SENT>
