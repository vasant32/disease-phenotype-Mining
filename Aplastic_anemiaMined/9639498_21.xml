<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present study we attempted to clarify the pathophysiological implications of stromal TPO in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects (NS) and in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001973'>idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi>), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0040028" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">essential thrombocythemia</z:e> (ET) by measuring TPO concentrations in BM and peripheral blood (PB) and by estimating the levels of stromal TPO <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> with TaqMan fluorescence-based post-reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction product detection system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results showed that TPO concentrations in PB were significantly elevated in patients with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> (34.9 +/- 11.7 pg/mL) and AA (364.1 +/- 153.5 pg/mL) but within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range in patients with ET (each 20.0 and 22.1; NS, 22.1 +/- 8.2 pg/mL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects, the TPO concentrations in BM correlated well with the PB levels, and the former were consistently higher than the latter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The concentrations of TPO in BM also correlated with the levels of TPO <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in stromal cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, expression levels of TPO <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> clearly correlated with megakaryocyte counts in NS and patients with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi>, indicating that stromal TPO actually enhances megakaryopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, our results in the present study indicate that TPO from BM stromal cells is considered to play an essential role for megakaryopoiesis under various patho-physiological conditions </plain></SENT>
