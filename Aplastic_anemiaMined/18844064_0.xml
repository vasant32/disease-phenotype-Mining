<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of phosphorylated protein kinase C epsilon (pPKC epsilon) on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of 32D cells induced by sera from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The expression of pPKC epsilon and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in 32D cells were measured by Western blotting and flow cytometry after incubation with sera from healthy individuals (controls, n = 8), patients with severe AA ( SAA, n = 8)and non severe AA (NSAA, n = 6) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After incubation for 0, 12, 24, 36 and 48 hours in the presence of serum and for another 4 hours in medium deprived of serum, the levels of pPKC epsilon in cells in SAA and NSAA group increased gradually, peaked at 24 hours, and then declined (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Compared with that in control group (0.54 +/- 0.08), pPKC epsilon was overexpressed in both SAA group (0.90 +/- 0.10) and NSAA group (0.64 +/- 0.08) (P &lt; 0.05) after 24 hours incubation with serum and subsequent 4 hours without serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>pPKC epsilon level was higher in SAA group than in NSAA group (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A greater proportion of 32D cells showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> after 24 hours incubation with sera from SAA patients [(4.05 +/- 1.05)%] and subsequent 4 hours incubation without serum than that in controls [(2.45 +/- 0.51)%, P &lt; 0.05], which was correlated with the same serum-induced expression of pPKC epsilon (r = 0.869, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although the mean level of pPKC epsilon expression was higher in NSAA group than in control group, no significant difference of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was found between the two groups [(2.45 +/- 0.51)% vs (3.24 +/- 0.56)%, P &gt; 0.05] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Sera from both SAA and NSAA patients could upregulate the expression of pPKC epsilon in 32D cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The SAA sera induce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> in 32D cells significantly, but the latter do not </plain></SENT>
