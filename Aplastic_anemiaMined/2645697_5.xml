<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe here 6 cases of successful engraftment following allogeneic BMT with cryopreserved marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients suffered from Wiscott-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043194" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Aldrich syndrome</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011002'>osteopetrosis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphocytic, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> non-lymphocytic, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo>, and ranged in age from 5 mos to 35 yrs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Marrow was collected using standard techniques </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Marrow was frozen for a variety of reasons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Buffy coat cells were frozen at controlled rate in 10% DMSO, and stored in liquid nitrogen for 6 to 49 d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Engraftment (WBC greater than 1000/uL x 3 d) occurred from 13 to 37 d post BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 4 of 4 cases in which data are available, donor origin of engraftment was documented, 1 with cytogenetics, 2 with red cell typing, and 4 with restriction fragment length polymorphisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>3 patients are alive and well 21, 21, and 42 months post BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggest frozen marrow can be successfully used for allogeneic BMT </plain></SENT>
