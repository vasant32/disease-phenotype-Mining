<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, erythropoietin production, as predicted, was abrogated in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0341697" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">renal impairment</z:e> (55 cases), but <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in nonuremic individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Specifically, patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo> (34 cases), sickle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (25 cases), aregenerative <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (27 cases), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (13 cases) had erythropoietin titers overlapping with those observed in simple <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (61 cases) at corresponding hematocrits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The response of polycythemic laboratory animals to <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> is more difficult to fit within the concept of an oxygen sensor responsive both to anemic and hypoxic <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>If the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001901'>polycythemia</z:hpo> was induced by hypertransfusion, erythropoietin production in response to <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> was, as predicted, less than that observed in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>If, however the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001901'>polycythemia</z:hpo> was induced by previous exposure to <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>, the animals responded to <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> as though they were not polycythemic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An explanation for this challenging observation may provide a clue as to the operation of the oxygen sensor </plain></SENT>
