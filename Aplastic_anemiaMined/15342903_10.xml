<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The girl had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001943'>hypoglycemia</z:hpo>, which normalized within 2 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0100327'>Cow milk allergy</z:hpo> was suspected initially, because of <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo>, followed by severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001510'>growth retardation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical and radiologic symptoms gradually became typical for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272170" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Shwachman-Diamond syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two common mutations in the SBDS gene (183-184TA--&gt;CT [K62X] and IVS2(258)+2T--&gt; C [C84fs]) were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Bone marrow transplantation from a matched unrelated donor was unsuccessful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The genetic information from the deceased patient enabled us to perform prenatal molecular studies during the subsequent pregnancy, successfully predicting a nonaffected child </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This report describes for the first time the hematologic abnormalities of congenital <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and prolonged <z:hpo ids='HP_0001998'>neonatal hypoglycemia</z:hpo> as the presenting symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272170" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Shwachman-Diamond syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The finding of common mutations in the presence of these symptoms at birth suggests the lack of a clear phenotype-genotype relationship in this syndrome </plain></SENT>
