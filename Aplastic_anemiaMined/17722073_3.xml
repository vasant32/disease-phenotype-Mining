<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, concerns regarding its safety cause delays in time and a successful outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Between 2000 and 2005, twenty-one children with poor prognostic nonmalignant disorders, 13 boys and 8 girls, with a median age of 12 months, underwent 28 haploidentical peripheral HSCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunomagnetic bead <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> device (CliniMACS) was used for indirect T-cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Indications for transplant were <z:hpo ids='HP_0004430'>severe combined immunodeficiency</z:hpo> (n=16), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011002'>osteopetrosis</z:hpo> (n=2), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (n=1), <z:hpo ids='HP_0004859'>amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> (n=1), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (n=1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five patients (24%) had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0876973" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lung infection</z:e> at the time of transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patients received a median of 25.67 x 10(6) G-CSF-mobilized peripheral CD34(+) progenitor cells and a median of 4.19 x 10(4) T-lymphocytes per kilogram of body weight with a T-cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> rate of median 4.59 logs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The rate of total engraftment was 66.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Median times for leukocyte and platelet engraftment were 14 and 16 days, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The 6-year projected survival was 32% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients and 29.76% for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004430'>severe combined immunodeficiency</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The rates of transplant-related mortality, graft failure, and severe GvHD were 14.2, 33.4%, and 8.3%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Infection</z:e> was the main cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The poor outcome may be explained with the poor prognostic factors of our patients such as the type of <z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> in most cases (T-B- <z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp>), the median age over 6 months and the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0876973" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">lung infection</z:e> in some children at the time of transplantation </plain></SENT>
