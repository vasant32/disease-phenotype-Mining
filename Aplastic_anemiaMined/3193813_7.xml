<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirteen of the 22 <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> patients showed megakaryocytic colony formation, when PHA-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LCM</z:e> and plasma of a patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> were used as a source of colony stimulating activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twelve of these 13 patients also showed spontaneous megakaryocytic growth, i.e. colony formation when PHA-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LCM</z:e> was omitted and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> plasma was used instead of aplastic plasma </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each patient without any megakaryocytic colony formation had recently received cytotoxic treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirteen of the 17 patients with MF grew megakaryocytic colonies and ten of these 13 patients also showed spontaneous megakaryocytic growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The colony numbers were roughly similar in the stimulated and non-stimulated cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The present study shows that spontaneous megakaryocytic colony formation, previously shown to be common in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> and ET, is also seen in many patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> and MF </plain></SENT>
