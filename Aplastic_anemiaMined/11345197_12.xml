<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the first retrospective analysis of a 7-year-old boy with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024314" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphoproliferative disease</z:e> (LPD) after an unrelated cord blood transplantation, serum EBV-DNA progressively increased to 4 x 10(5) copies/mL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>EBV load was then prospectively monitored in peripheral blood from posttransplantation patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The second case was an 8 year-old boy with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> who received a CD34+ cell transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This patient died of LPD with the progression of pulmonary nodules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>EBV-DNA increased to 4 x 10(4) copies/mL after the control of cytomegalovirus reactivation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, EBV-DNA was undetectable (&lt;200 copies/mL) in the series of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 58 samples from 10 patients who did not develop LPD after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sequential monitoring of circulating EBV-DNA by quantitative PCR may be a useful indicator for predicting the development of posttransplantation LPD </plain></SENT>
