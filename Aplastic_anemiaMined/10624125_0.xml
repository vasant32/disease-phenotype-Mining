<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We evaluated measurements of PAIgG, reticulated platelets (RP), plasma thrombopoietin (TPO) levels, and platelet size to determine whether these parameters were useful for the differential diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001973'>idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi>), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA), and hypoplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> (HypoT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The percentage of RP (%RP) in patients with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> was significantly higher (25.2 +/- 11.0%, P &lt; 0.001) than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects (7.9 +/- 2.8), and the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value of %RP in diagnosing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> were 82%, 95%, 96%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, TPO levels in patients with AA and HypoT were significantly higher (355.5 +/- 218.7 pg/ml, P &lt; 0.001, and 376.4 +/- 347.2, P &lt; 0.001, respectively) than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects (36.7 +/- 23.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value of TPO in diagnosing AA and HypoT were 88%, 89% and 86%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also sought to determine whether the simultaneous measurement of %RP and TPO improved their value in the differential diagnosis of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi>, AA, and HypoT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, simultaneous measurement did not yield significant improvements in sensitivty, specificity, or predictive value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results indicated that measurements of %RP will suffice for the diagnosis of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi>, and that measurements of TPO are adequate for the diagnosis of AA and HypoT </plain></SENT>
