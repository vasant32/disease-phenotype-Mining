<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After termination of the preparation transfusion a decrease in the levels of "active" T-lymphocytes and cells with C3-receptors was recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The levels of immature T-lymphocytes were found to be lowered four weeks after ALG-therapy, while other subpopulations remained within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The lowering activity of immunogenesis in the bone marrow combined with hemopoietic recovery after the immunosuppressive therapy have evidenced a possible participation of immunologic mechanisms in the pathogenesis of acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> in children </plain></SENT>
