<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two sequential therapeutic trials for the treatment of severe and moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> in children were conducted by 10 institutions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The treatment protocols included antithymocyte globulin (ATG), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> A (CSA); patients entered on the first protocol, 0190 (ATG X 2), were given two courses of ATG, and those enrolled on the second protocol, 0190B (ATG X 1), were given only one course of ATG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ten patients were evaluable on ATG X 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had SAA; three had <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo>-induced severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (HI-SAA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients were evaluable on ATG X 1; <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had SAA, one of whom had HI-SAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seven of 10 patients on ATG X 2 responded, and eight of 12 patients treated on ATG X 1 responded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Treatment with immunosuppressive therapy using ATG, CSA, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> was very well tolerated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The response rates in both protocols were similar, and results compare favorably with those of previous therapeutic trials, suggesting that a second course of ATG is not necessary </plain></SENT>
