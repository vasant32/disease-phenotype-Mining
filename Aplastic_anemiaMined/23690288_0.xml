<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow transplantation remains the standard of care for younger patients and those with a good performance status but many patients may not have a suitable donor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunosuppressive therapy is able to resolve cytopenias in a majority of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> but relapses are not uncommon and some patients remain refractory to this approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients may require frequent blood and platelet transfusion support which is expensive and inconvenient </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thrombopoietin (TPO) mimetics, such as romiplostim and eltrombopag, were developed to treat patients with refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001973'>immune thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> but are now being investigated for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>TPO is the main regulator for platelet production and its receptor (c-Mpl) is present on megakaryocytes and hematopoietic stem cells </plain></SENT>
