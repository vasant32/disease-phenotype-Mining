<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We investigated the clinical significance of a minor population of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004818'>paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>)-type blood cells in patients with acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We quantified CD55-CD59- granulocytes and red blood cells (RBCs) in peripheral blood from 122 patients with recently diagnosed AA and correlated numbers of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>-type cells and responses to immunosuppressive therapy (IST) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometry detected 0.005% to 23.1% of GPI-AP- cells in 68% of patients with AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sixty-eight of 83 (91%) patients with an increased proportion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>-type cells (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>+) responded to antithymocyte globulin (ATG) + cyclosporin (CsA) therapy, whereas 18 of 39 (48%) without such an increase (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>-) responded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Failure-free survival rates were significantly higher (64%) among patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>+ than patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>- (12%) at 5 years, although overall survival rates were comparable between the groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Numbers of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>-type and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>-type cells increased in parallel among most patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>+ who responded to IST, suggesting that these cells are equally sensitive to immune attack </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that a minor population of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>-type cells represents a reliable marker of a positive IST response and a favorable prognosis among patients with AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, immune attack against hematopoietic stem cells that allows <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> clonal expansion might occur only at the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of AA </plain></SENT>
