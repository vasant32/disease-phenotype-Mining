<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">TRALI</z:e> is a challenging diagnosis for both the transfusion specialist and the clinician </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A Canadian consensus panel has recently proposed guidelines to better define <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">TRALI</z:e> and its implications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The guidelines recommend classifying each suspected case in one of the following 3 categories: (1) "<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">TRALI</z:e>," (2) "Possible <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">TRALI</z:e>," or (3) "Not <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">TRALI</z:e>." We report the clinical presentation, laboratory evaluation, and management of 3 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>respiratory failure</z:hpo> (RF) following allogeneic blood transfusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These patients <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> experienced RF within 6 hr post-transfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Based on a review of the clinical and laboratory data and applying the Canadian guidelines, the first patient, a 67-yr-old man with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelomonocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, was diagnosed as "<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">TRALI</z:e>" due to the sudden <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of RF requiring intensive resuscitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The second patient, a 55-yr-old man with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, was diagnosed as "Possible <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">TRALI</z:e>" due to pre-existing RF that worsened after blood transfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The third patient, a 1-yr-old male, was diagnosed as transfusion associated circulatory overload (TACO) and "Possible <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">TRALI</z:e>," although his RF improved after treatment with <z:chebi fb="40" ids="35498">diuretics</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 3 cases, the blood donor center was informed of the suspected <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">TRALI</z:e> reactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The remaining blood products from the donors associated with these reactions were quarantined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After review of the clinical data, the donors associated with cases #1 and #3 were screened by the blood center for granulocyte and HLA antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Using a Luminex flow bead array, the following class I and class II antibodies specific for patient #1 were identified in the respective donor: anti-A25, B8, B18, and anti-DR15, DR 17 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, donor #1 was permanently deferred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A non-specific IgM anti-granulocyte antibody was identified in the donor associated with case #3, and this donor was subsequently disqualified from plasma and platelet donations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the Canadian guidelines to categorize patients suspected of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">TRALI</z:e> provide a useful framework for evaluation of these patients and their respective blood donors </plain></SENT>
