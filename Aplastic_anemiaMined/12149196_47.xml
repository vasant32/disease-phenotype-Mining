<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Failure to respond and a later relapse could be due to deficient numbers of hematopoietic stem cells, inadequate treatment of the immune process, or a nonimmunologic etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) has been implicated in the pathophysiology of hematopoietic failure in AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the basis of previous findings showing overexpression of IFN-gamma in bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB) in this disease, we hypothesized that quantitation of IFN-gamma might be applied to predict and monitor responses to immunosuppressive therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We measured expression of IFN-gamma in lymphocytes obtained from 123 AA patients, using intracellular 2-color fluorescent staining and flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Of 70 patients with severe AA, 36 (51%) demonstrated increased IFN-gamma in circulating T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>IFN-gamma was detected in only 4 of 53 patients who had recovered from AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>IFN-gamma was not found in PB lymphocytes of patients with other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic diseases</z:e> and heavy transfusion burdens or in healthy volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among 62 AA patients who were assessed before first treatment with immunosuppressive drugs, 27 of 28 (96%) with circulating IFN-gamma-containing T cells subsequently responded to therapy; in contrast, only 11 of 34 (32%) patients whose PB lacked IFN-gamma lymphocytes improved to transfusion independence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>IFN-gamma-containing lymphocytes declined following treatment in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of 17 patients assessed during relapse, IFN-gamma was present in T cells prior to the blood count decline in 13, and 12 responded to reinstitution of immunosuppressive drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Of 30 BMs tested prior to first treatment, 20, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> in responding patients, were positive for IFN-gamma, whereas the negative tests were obtained in 10 nonresponding patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>IFN-gamma is increased in the PB lymphocytes of many patients with AA, and these cells decline with therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The presence of intracellular IFN-gamma may predict response to immunosuppressive treatment and also the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of relapse </plain></SENT>
