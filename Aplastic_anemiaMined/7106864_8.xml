<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Lymphocytes from an extensively transfused patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> were induced to cytotoxicity against target cells from several HLA-matched siblings by in vitro stimulation with allogeneic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Effective stimulating cells shared HLA-B7 with the patient, but not <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> B7 individuals were effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An additional factor, which was found to segregate in both the patient's and an unrelated sibship, was also necessary </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Segregation of this minor alloantigen, W, was also revealed among the patient's HLA-matched sibs by differential susceptibility to lysis by effectors from the patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The ratio of six positive to four negative siblings suggests that the antigen difference might be coded by a single locus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Lymphocytes from a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> sib, who like the patient is lacking the minor antigen, could not be induced to cytotoxicity against positive targets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus in vivo sensitization of the donor of the responding cells appears to be necessary for the demonstration of the cytotoxic response to the minor antigen in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No correlation was observed between the segregation pattern of W and of known blood group antigens, and no cytotoxic antibody to W was detected in the patient's serum in several trials </plain></SENT>
