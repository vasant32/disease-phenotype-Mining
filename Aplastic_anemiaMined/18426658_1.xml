<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Amplification refractory mutation system-polymerase chain reaction was used to amplify the polymorphism gene segment of IFN-gamma +874 A/T from 54 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> patients and 51 healthy adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the frequency of IFN-gamma +874 TT genotype and T allele was significantly higher in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> than that in the healthy adults (42.6% vs 17.6%, chi2=13.780, p=0.01; 65.7% vs 39.2%; chi2=14.811, p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, IFN-gamma +874 A/T gene polymorphism is correlated with the susceptibility of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, but not significantly correlated with the the severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
