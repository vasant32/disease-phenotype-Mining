<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have analyzed 2,002 patients grafted in Europe between 1976 and 1998 from an identical twin (n = 34), from an HLA-identical sibling (n = 1,699) or from an alternative donor (n = 269), which included unrelated and family mismatched donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The proportions of patients surviving in these three groups are, respectively, 91, 66 and 37%: major causes of failure were <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus host disease</z:e> (GvHD) (11%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> (12%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032285" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PNEUM">pneumonitis</z:e> (4%), rejection (4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In multivariate Cox analysis, factors predicting outcome were patient's age (p &lt; 0.0001), donor type (p &lt; 0.0001), interval between diagnosis and bone marrow transplantation (BMT) (p &lt; 0.0005), year of BMT (p = 0.0005) and female donor for a male recipient (p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were then divided in two groups according to the year of BMT: up to or after 1990 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The overall <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate dropped from 43 to 24% (p &lt; 0.00001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Improvements were seen mostly for grafts from identical siblings (from 54 to 75%, p &lt; 0.0001), and less so for alternative-donor grafts (from 28 to 35%; p = 0.07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Major changes have occurred in the BMT protocol: decreasing use of radiotherapy in the conditioning regimen (from 35 to 24%; p &lt; 0.0001) and increasing use of cyclosporin (with or without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi>) for GvHD prophylaxis (from 70 to 98%; p &lt; 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the outcome of allogeneic BMT for patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> has considerably improved over the past two decades: young patients, grafted early after diagnosis from an identical sibling, have currently an over 80% chance of long-term survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Transplants from twins are very successful as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The risk of complications with alternative donor transplants is still high </plain></SENT>
