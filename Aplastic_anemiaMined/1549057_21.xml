<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Sixty percent of the patients were males, 71% were white, their mean age was 33.6 years (median, 27.5; range, 1-75), and 83% had severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One hundred three patients developed 1 or more febrile episodes during the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The risk factors for developing a febrile episode included a low Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) and Absolute Monocyte Count (AMC) at admission and the presence of an indwelling central venous catheter (Hickman-Broviack or Port-A-Cath) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A total of 289 febrile events were studied, including unexplained <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> (FUO) in 89 (31%), microbiologically documented <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> (MBDI) in 137 (47%), and clinically documented <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> (CDI) in 63 patients (22%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared to documented <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> (MBDI) or CDI), FUO events were associated with a higher frequency of rigors, signs and symptoms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036830" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">serum sickness</z:e>, and treatment regimens known to cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fevers</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>None of the FUO events had a fatal outcome, even if the antibiotic therapy was discontinued before day 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among CDI events, bacteria were the most commonly defined etiologic agent (67%), followed by fungi (23%), viruses (7%), and parasites (3%) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one patients (15%) developed invasive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026946" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fungal infections</z:e> (aspergillus, 11; candida, 7; and both, 3), which were fatal in 19 (90%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026946" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Fungal infections</z:e> accounted for 30% of the secondary infectious events and for 55% of fatal infectious events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The only identifiable risk factors for developing a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026946" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fungal infection</z:e> were the degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0000223'>monocytopenia</z:mp> at initial admission or final evaluation </plain></SENT>
