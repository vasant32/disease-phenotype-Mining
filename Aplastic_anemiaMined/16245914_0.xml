<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of Shenmai injection on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> patients and its mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Sixty-five <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> patients were randomized into treatment group and control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patients of the treatment group were treated by injecting Shenmai injection and taking western medicine orally, those of the control group taking western medicine orally only, then the effect was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The concentration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in blood serum was detected and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of bone marrow CD34+ cell was analysed by DNA ISEL technic before and after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULT: The effective rate of the treatment group and the control group was 63.6 % and 40.6 % respectively, the effect of the Shenmai injection on the treatment group was obviously better than that of the control group (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Before treatment, the concentration of TNF-alpha in blood serum and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> rate of bone marrow CD34+ cell of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> patient were higher than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After treatment, the concentration of TNF-alpha in blood serum of the treatment group decreased obviously (P &lt; 0.01), and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> rate of bone marrow CD34+ cell of the treatment group also decreased (P &lt; 0.05), which had significant difference compared with those of the control group (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Shenmai injection is efficient to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mechanism is decreasing the concentration of TNF-alpha in blood serum and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> rate of bone marrow CD34+ cell </plain></SENT>
