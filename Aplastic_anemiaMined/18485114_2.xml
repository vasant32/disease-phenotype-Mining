<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The TIM-3 pathway, however, has not been investigated in acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined the expression of TIM-3 and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) at both transcript and protein levels in 29 acquired AA patients and in 31 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Increased <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of TIM-3 and IFN-gamma were observed in both peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and bone marrow mononuclear cells from AA patients and controls using quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An increase of TIM-3 expression on PBMCs was detected increased in AA patients by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An overproduction of IFN-gamma was determined in the sera from AA patients by enzyme-linked immunoassay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, the expression of TIM-3 ligand, galectin-9, increased in PBMCs from AA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results are the first human data to demonstrate the increase of TIM-3 expression in AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The enhanced TIM-3 engagement by its ligand in AA patients may play an important role in the pathogenesis of this disease </plain></SENT>
