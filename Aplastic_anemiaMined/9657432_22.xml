<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The subjects were 40 healthy volunteers and 45 thrombocytopenic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0001973'>idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi>), the percentage of reticulated platelets was significantly elevated (5.61 +/- 2.02%: mean +/- SD) relative to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (2.17 +/- 0.90%), but serum TPO concentrations (1.91 +/- 1.27 fmol/l) did not differ significantly from the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range (1.43 +/- 0.62 fmol/l) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) had decreased reticulated platelet counts and markedly increased serum TPO concentrations (13.65 +/- 10.64 fmol/l) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In thrombocytopenic patients with liver <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo> (LC), the absolute number of reticulated platelets (1.65 +/- 1.11 x 10(9)/l) decreased similarly that in AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, serum TPO concentrations (1.38 +/- 0.50 fmol/l) did not increase in contrast to AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggested a possible dual mechanism of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> in LC; that is, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> in LC results from the decreased TPO production primarily in the liver adding to an increase in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272296" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">platelet sequestration</z:e> in the spleen </plain></SENT>
