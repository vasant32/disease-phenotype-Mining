<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Diagnosis of B19 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> relies on serology and the detection of <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> DNA by PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These techniques are usually thought to detect <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> erythrovirus field isolates, since the B19 genome is known to undergo few genetic variations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have detected an erythrovirus (V9) markedly different from B19 in the serum and bone marrow of a child with transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The B19 PCR assay yielded a product that hybridized only very weakly to the B19-specific probe and whose sequence diverged more from those of 24 B19 viruses (11 to 14%) than the divergence found within the B19 group (&lt;/=6.65%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Restriction enzyme analysis of the V9 genome revealed that this genetic divergence extended beyond the amplified region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, serological tests failed to demonstrate a response characteristic of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> B19 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>V9 could be a new erythrovirus, and new diagnostic tests are needed for its detection </plain></SENT>
