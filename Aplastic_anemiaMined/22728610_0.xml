<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between January 2003 and December 2009 452 blood cultures from CVC were carried out on 120 patients affected by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphoblastyic and myelougenous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (38), Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (17) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> (65), with an average of 65 blood cultures per year showing an average positiveness of 21 cases/year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The blood cultures were performed, in hyperpyrexia, when there was a clinical suspicion of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> from CVC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: On 452 blood cultures from CVC carried out (31.4% positive per Gram +, 53.7% per Gram-, 14.9% per miceti) 128 (28.3%) resulted positive, excluding presumed contaminations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>They were divided as follows: 21 of Staphylococcus epidermidis (16%), 10 of Escherichia coli (8%), 10 of Klebsiella pneumoniae (8%), 8 of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6%), 8 of Staphylococcus aureus (6%), 6 of Enterobacter cloacae (5%), 4 of Candida parapsilosis (3%) and 61 of other micro-organisms (48%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It was necessary to perform 27 CVC removals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The micro-organisms most frequently involved in removals of the CVC were finally analyzed and the resulting frequency percentages are: - 85% for Gram- germs; -8% for Gram + germs; -7% for Mycete </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our clinical study has confirmed that in pediatric age neoplastic individuals there is a prevalence of CVC-correlated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> from Gram- and an elevated association of removals of the CVC caused by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> from Pseudomonas and Klebsiella, germs more frequently associated to clinical conditions of marked <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
