<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>With a newly developed enzyme linked immunosorbent assay kit TOYOBO Co. in which 2 anti-EPO monoclonal antibodies were used, we assayed EPO concentration in sera from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> adults, 168 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo> and 333 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0947743,C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematological disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo>, serum EPO level was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> (52.9%) or reduced (42.9%), and there was no correlation to their hematocrits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, there was an increment in EPO concentration correlated to their severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> in the most patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0947743,C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematological disorders</z:e>, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001891'>iron deficiency anemia</z:hpo> (correlation coefficient r = -0.74), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (r = -0.89), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (r = -0.81), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (r = -0.65) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, EPO concentration in sera from <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the untreated patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001901'>polycythemia</z:hpo> vera were significantly low level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>But the concentrations of EPO from the patients successfully treated, with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hematocrit were recovered to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the patients with secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001901'>polycythemia</z:hpo>, there were much varieties in EPO level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Assay of EPO in blood is important not only for diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001901'>polycythemia</z:hpo> but also for the analysis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> and clinical use of EPO in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The method described here is accurate and technically not complicated, and could be widely induced in most laboratories </plain></SENT>
