<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Epoetin alpha was given subcutaneously every day at a dose of 3,000IU/body for two weeks, and the dosage was increased to 6,000IU, 12,000IU and 24,000IU every two weeks when the increment of Hb was insufficient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In cases in whom Hb concentration increased by more than 1g/dl or whose transfusion requirements reduced to less than 50%, treatment was judged to be effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The whole rate of efficacy was 34.5% (10/29) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Response to epoetin alpha treatment was better in patients whose symptoms were relatively mild </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mild cases responded to the treatment with 6,000IU/body/day, although a dosage of 24,000IU/body/day was required in moderate or severe cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neither serious adverse effect nor abnormal laboratory findings were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that high dose subcutaneous epoetin alpha treatment is effective for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> in terms of increasing Hb concentration and reducing blood transfusions </plain></SENT>
