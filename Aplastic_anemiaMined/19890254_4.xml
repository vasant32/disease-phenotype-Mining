<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present the implementation of a prospective pharmacovigilance program based on automatic laboratory signals (ALSs) at a hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We also report the general findings after the first year of operation of the program, which involved ALSs that indicate various SADRs: <z:mp ids='MP_0000334'>agranulocytosis</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, liver injury, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002902'>hyponatremia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003201'>rhabdomyolysis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The number of hospitalizations during the year was 54,525, and 1,732 patients experienced at least one ALS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The review of electronic medical records (EMRs) showed that no alternative cause (i.e., no non-SADR explanation) for the ALS was identified in 520 (30%) of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After the individual ALS-patient evaluation, a total of 110 SADRs (6.35% of those identified after reviewing EMRs and 21.15% of those requiring individual patient evaluations) were identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In other words, in order to identify a single SADR, we had to review the electronic records of approximately 16 patients and personally visit 5 patients </plain></SENT>
