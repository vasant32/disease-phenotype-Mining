<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The resulting relative frequency distributions of the <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> fluorescence intensities concurred with the different stages in maturation from early reticulocytes to mature red cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A computer program was written to calculate from these frequency distributions the relative number of reticulocytes, their relative <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> content, and the median of the reticulocyte population (<z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> index) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This method was applied to 30 healthy blood bank donors (control group), as well as to patients with various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521860" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic disorders</z:e> showing abnormal erythropoietic activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The measured percentage of reticulocytes, <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> content, and <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> index were found to correlate well with the various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521860" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Changes in erythropoiesis could be clearly followed, as was demonstrated by analyzing blood samples from children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo>, who were treated with allogeneic bone marrow transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Measurements on blood samples from healthy blood bank donors showed that with this method, small changes in the reticulocyte population, such as the appearance of polychromatic erythrocytes in the peripheral blood 5-8 hr after donation, can be detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The statistical reliability and the information provided on the maturation stage of the entire reticulocyte population make flow cytometry of peripheral blood reticulocytes a more informative method for the study of hematologic abnormalities than conventional methods for reticulocyte counting and classification </plain></SENT>
