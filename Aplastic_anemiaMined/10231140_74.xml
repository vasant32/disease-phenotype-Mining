<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>IL-7 is produced by stromal cells and is the major lympho- and thymopoietic cytokine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>IL-7 induces proliferation and differentiation of immature thymocytes, and protects thymocytes from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> by induction of bcl-2 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The regulation of IL-7 production is poorly characterized, although down-regulation by transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) has been described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We measured the serum levels of IL-7 before and after bone marrow transplant (BMT) in 32 children undergoing BMT for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic diseases</z:e> (severe combined <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immune deficiency</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp>) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039730" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thalassemia</z:e>), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphoblastic and non-lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL and ANLL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Prior to BMT, the highest IL-7 levels were observed in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> and ALL, i.e. those patients with genetic or acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001888'>lymphopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039730" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thalassemia</z:e> and ANLL had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels of IL-7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Over the 8 weeks following BMT, the IL-7 levels of patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> and ALL fell as the absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No detectable change in IL-7 levels was observed in the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039730" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thalassemia</z:e> and ANLL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Levels of IL-7 were highest in the young infants with <z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> compared to the age-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Together, the data demonstrate that serum levels of IL-7 in lymphopenic patients are inversely related to patient age and the absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The inverse relationship to ALC suggests that there is either direct regulation of stromal production or more likely, binding of secreted IL-7 to lymphocytes expressing IL-7 receptors </plain></SENT>
