<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, main characteristics and results of HPCT along 20 years are analyzed from the experience of Postgraduate School of Hematology "Farreras-Valentí" at the Hospital Clínic in Barcelona </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Six-hundred ninety-five patients transplanted between June 1976 and January 1996 were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Median age (range) were 33 (4-63) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The following aspects were considered: donor type, source or progenitor cells, type of disease and disease-stage at transplantation, transplant related mortality and survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 714 HPCT were performed (448 allogeneic, 13 isogeneic, 253 autogeneic) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Allogeneic HPCT were from an HLA-identical sibling in 408 cases, from other familial donors in 10, and from non-familial donors in 30 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Most HPCT from non-familial donors (93%) were performed during the last five years of the study (1991-1995) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The source of hemopoietic progenitor cells was bone marrow in 625 instances (88%), peripheral blood in 88 (12%), and fetal liver in one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>During more than 15 years, the only source of progenitors was the bone marrow; in contrast, in the last 3 years (1993-1995) transplants using peripheral blood were predominant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Main indications for HPCT were the following: <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemias</z:hpo> (n = 387) (54%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0005558'>chronic leukemias</z:hpo> (n = 134) (19%), severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (n = 58) (8%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> (n = 80) (11%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> (n = 39) (5%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (n = 14) (2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e> (n = 656), HPCT was performed in first complete remission or in first <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phase in 321 instances (49%), in subsequent remissions in 144 (22%), and in more advanced stages in the remaining 191 (29%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In the more recent years, a progressive decrease in the number of HPCT for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> was observed, contrasting with an increase in transplants for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Of note, a significant decrease in transplant related mortality was evident along the years, both after autogeneic HPCT (21% during 1985-1992 and 6% thereafter) (p = 0.001) and after allogeneic transplantation (54%, 44%, and 20% during the periods 1976-1984, 1985-1992 and 1993-1995, respectively) (p = 0.004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The fact translated into an increase in the actuarial probability of survival after allogeneic HPCT (25%, 33% and 58% in the three mentioned periods, respectively) (p = 0.0003), and after autogeneic HPCT (33% in the interim 1985-1992, and 55% in the period 1993-1995) (p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: During the last 20 years, HPCT has significantly evolved in aspects such as type of donor, source of progenitor cells and indications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Remarkably, a progressive decrease in transplant related mortality has been observed translating into a improvement in survival after the procedure </plain></SENT>
