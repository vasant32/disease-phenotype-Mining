<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of the 33 patients studied 27 presented with clinically diagnosed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GvHD, one patient died of bone marrow rejection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Immunohistological analysis of the respective skin biopsies with selected monoclonal antibodies against human leukocyte antigens (HLA) and differentiation antigens of the lympho-hematopoietic cells revealed low dermal mononuclear cell counts with phenotypically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> constituents in five cases with uncomplicated reconstitution post-grafting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, increased dermal cellular infiltrates predominantly consisting of Lyt 3+, OKT 8+ T-lymphocytes, as well as of a large number of Ia-like (immune response associated = HLA-D) determinant + monocytes/macrophages were observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients with active <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GvH reactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As sign of activation simultaneous expression of HLA-D region products was also found on a subset of the invading OKT8+ T-lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Progression of GvHD was associated with additional surface staining of keratinocytes for Ia-like determinants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Loss of Ia-like determinant+, OKT6+ dentritic epithelial cells in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> leukemic patients, as well as in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> with or without GvHD suggested damage of Langerhans cells due to the previous radiotherapy and/or specific immunological destruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In patients with fatal outcome of GvHD prolonged reduction of these dentritic epithelial cells seemed to be indicative of impaired immune reconstitution or bone marrow dysfunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus immunopathological features of skin GvHR may enable early recognition and prognostic evaluation of this disease possibly allowing more effective therapy </plain></SENT>
