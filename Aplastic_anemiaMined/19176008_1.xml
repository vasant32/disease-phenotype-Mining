<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The DC1 (HLA-DR+Lin-CD11c+) and DC2 (HLA-DR+Lin-CD123+) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNC) were measured with flow cytometry (FCM), the expressions of T-bet <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and GATA-3 mRNA in PBMNC with semiquantitative RT-PCR and the plasma level of IFN gamma and IL-4 with ELISA in 29 SAA patients and 16 healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The percentages of DC1 in PBMNC were (0.44 +/- 0.24)% and (0.73 +/- 0.30)% in untreated and recovered SAA patients respectively, both were higher than that in controls (0.29 +/- 0.10)% (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The percentage of DC2 in the untreated cases was lower than that of recovered ones or controls [(0.18 +/- 0.14)% vs (0.28 +/- 0.20)% and (0.29 +/- 0.13)%] (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>DC1/DC2 ratios were 3.45 +/- 2.71 and 2.90 +/- 0.95 in untreated and recovered groups respectively, both were higher than that in controls (1.15 +/- 0.56) (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No statistic difference in DC1/DC2 ratio was found between untreated and recovered patients (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The relative <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression levels of transcriptive factor T-bet were 0.37 +/- 0.07, 0.20 +/- 0.07 and 0.17 +/- 0.05 in the above 3 groups, respectively, untreated group being higher than that of recovered group or healthy controls (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no statistic difference of GATA-3 expression among the 3 groups (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>T-bet/GATA-3 ratio was 0.72 +/- 0.13 in untreated group, being higher than that of recovered group (0.33 +/- 0.08) or controls (0.35 +/- 0.11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The plasma level of IFN gamma in the untreated group was (50.9 +/- 1.1) ng/L, which was higher than that of recovered group [(49.7 +/- 0.9) ng/L] or controls [(49.7 +/- 0.7) ng/L] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was significant positive correlations between T-bet and DC1/DC2 ratio (r = 0.445, P &lt; 0.01), as well as between T-bet and IFN gamma (r = 0.402, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Either DC1/DC2 or T-bet/GATA-3 ratio might become an index to estimate immune imbalance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>High-expressed T-bet was related to the progress of SAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In patients with SAA, DC1/DC2 ratio returns to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range later than that of routine blood test does, indicating that immunosuppressive therapy should not be withdrawn too earlier </plain></SENT>
