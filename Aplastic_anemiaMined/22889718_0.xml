<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We analyzed sera of 53 bona fide AA patients before and after treatment with anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) or bone marrow transplantation for the presence of anti-CA antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Anti-CA antibodies were detected in 20 patients (38%) and were associated with older age at diagnosis of AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Antibody-positive patients showed poor response to ATG treatment (complete response 14%) and inferior long-term survival (36% at 10 years), when compared to antibody-negative patients (complete response and 10-year survival both 64%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two thirds of patients with antibodies at diagnosis of AA became antibody negative after treatment with ATG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clearance of the antibody did not appear to be associated with hematological improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Antibodies against CA are detected frequently at diagnosis of AA, and their presence identifies a subset of patients with poor response to immunosuppressive treatment </plain></SENT>
