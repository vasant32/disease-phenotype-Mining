<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We defined a cohort of 127,266 men with at least 1 day of employment during the period of 1979 through 2000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Computerized human resources databases were the basis of the cohort definition as well as the source of demographic and most work history information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Standardized mortality ratios (SMR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for 94 causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, including analyses by operating segment and job type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Most SMR results are below unity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The main exception is <z:mpath ids='MPATH_365'>mesothelioma</z:mpath> (SMR = 1.49; 95% CI = 1.15 to 1.90), which has elevations three times greater than expectation among some groups of men working in manufacturing sites who were hired before 1960 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>SMRs for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> of the blood and blood-forming organs are generally close to unity, whereas men in the chemicals segment have 17 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> non-lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (SMR = 1.81; 95% CI = 1.06 to 2.90), with no temporal or job type patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Men in the downstream segment have an elevation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (SMR = 2.19; 95% CI = 0.95 to 4.32), based on eight <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There are eight <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> from <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>malignant melanoma</z:hpo> among downstream drivers (SMR = 2.46; 95% CI = 1.06 to 4.84), and motor vehicle accident rates are slightly elevated among some groups of younger and shorter-term operators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This comprehensive study indicates an overall favorable mortality profile for this workforce </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For a few elevations, the study helps guide decisions about future surveillance, focused studies, and other follow-up actions </plain></SENT>
