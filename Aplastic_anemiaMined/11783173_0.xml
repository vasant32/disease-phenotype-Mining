<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Applying the assay of microcell lesion inhibitory and L595 cytotoxicity test to detect gamma-IFN and TNF-alpha level 36 thirty-six cases with CAA before and after treatment with YYSXC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: To compare the test group with the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> group, the difference was significant before treatment (P &lt; 0.05, P &lt; 0.01), but after treatment, the difference was insignificant between these two groups (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To compare the group of Kidney Yin Deficiency with Kidney Yang Deficiency, both the difference of before and after treatment were significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For the therapeutic effective rate, the group of Kidney Yang Deficiency was higher than that of Kidney Yin Deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: YYSXC could treat CAA through reducing the level of peripheral gamma-IFN and TNF-alpha of CAA patients, and the effect was through regulating the dysfunctional immune state </plain></SENT>
