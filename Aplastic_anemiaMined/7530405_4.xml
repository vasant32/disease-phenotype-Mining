<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF) and erythropoietin (rhEPO) were used to treat patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In terms of effects on erythrocyte recovery, the combined use of rhG-CSF and rhEPO showed a favorable response in 6 of 14 (42.9%) patients with moderate AA following 10 weeks treatment and in 3 of 14 (21.4%) patients thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the response was poor in patients with severe AA (3/13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A favorable response in severe AA was observed in 1 of 13 (7.7%) patients following 10 weeks treatment and in 2 of 13 (15.4%) patients thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The overall effect on erythrocytes was observed in 44.4% patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A dose of 400 micrograms/m2 G-CSF was sufficient to cause an increase in neutrophil count and 100 IU/kg rhEPO appeared to be sufficient to cause an increase in erythrocyte count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 6 of 27 (22.2%) patients, a trilineage response was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, a delayed and long-lasting effect was obtained in 5 of 27 (18.5%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that rhG-CSF can synergize with rhEPO in erythrocyte response, especially in patients with moderate AA </plain></SENT>
