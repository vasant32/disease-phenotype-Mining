<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aims of this study were to evaluate both the therapeutic efficacy and safety of AZA/<z:chebi fb="1" ids="2208,50667">6-MP</z:chebi> in this group of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fourteen members of the Japanese Society for Pediatric <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021390" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Inflammatory Bowel Disease</z:e> reported 35 retrospective cases that received AZA/<z:chebi fb="1" ids="2208,50667">6-MP</z:chebi> and were evaluated for adverse drug effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In those who tolerated AZA/<z:chebi fb="1" ids="2208,50667">6-MP</z:chebi>, disease activity and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> doses before and during the first 6 months of therapy were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: AZA or <z:chebi fb="1" ids="2208,50667">6-MP</z:chebi> was safely used in 21 of 35 patients (60%) without adverse drug effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The disease activity began to decrease from the first month of therapy and the maximum effect was achieved after 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The mean daily <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> dose was decreased from 26.9 to 11.6 mg and dose reduction was achieved in 58% of patients after 6 months of therapy </plain></SENT>
