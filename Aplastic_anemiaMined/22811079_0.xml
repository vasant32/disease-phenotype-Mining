<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: To investigate the immune status among pediatric patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) and explore <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>-status, T-regulatory and NK-cell frequency as potential markers of clinical response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Data were retrospectively analyzed from twenty-six patients diagnosed with AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> populations, T- and NK-subsets were determined via flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At diagnosis, 9/23 patients with severe AA (SAA) versus 1/3 with moderate AA (<z:chebi fb="8" ids="35738">MAA</z:chebi>) were <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>(pos)  </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>(pos) patients treated with ATG based immunosuppression, 2/6 had a complete response (CR), while 4/6 had a partial response (PR), similarly 2/6 PNH(neg) patients had a CR and 4/6 had a PR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Lymphocyte subset immunophenotyping revealed that T-regulatory cells represented 7.2% of total lymphocytes at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Their frequency varied with disease severity (5.5% for SAA and 14.1% for <z:chebi fb="8" ids="35738">MAA</z:chebi>) and response (8.9% for CR and 1.5% for PR), generally increasing following therapy with IST (14.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The NK cell frequency was not substantially different based on disease severity or response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Neither <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> cell populations, nor NK cell frequency corresponded with disease severity or response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>T-regulatory cell frequency, although not statistically significant given the small sample size, corresponded with both severity and response, indicating potential utility as a prognostic tool </plain></SENT>
