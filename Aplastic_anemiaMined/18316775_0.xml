<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The numbers of antibody-binding sites of CD41, CD41a, CD41b, and CD61 on platelets of the AA patients were less than in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (p &lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> patients, the numbers of sites for CD41 and CD41a were less than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (p &lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were significant positive correlations between CD41 and CD41a, CD41b, and CD61 in the 3 groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were significant negative correlations between CD41 and CD41b and between CD41a and CD41b in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls, but not in the AA or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In summary, the numbers of the 4 antibody-binding sites of GPIIb/IIIa on platelets of AA and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> patients are different from those in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Measurements of the antibody-binding sites of GPIIb/IIIa are not necessary for the differential diagnosis of AA and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the differences in correlations between the numbers of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> in AA and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> patients suggest that the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> of GPIIb/IIIa are altered in these diseases </plain></SENT>
