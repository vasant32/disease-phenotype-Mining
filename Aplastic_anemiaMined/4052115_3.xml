<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It has been suggested that in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17698">chloramphenicol</z:chebi>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> nitrosochloramphenicol may be involved as a toxic intermediate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We found that aminochloramphenicol, which reportedly is formed from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17698">chloramphenicol</z:chebi> by intestinal bacteria, is N-oxygenated by liver microsomes of untreated rats with apparent Km = 0.4 mM and Vmax = 0.28 nmole/min/mg protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These values are in close agreement with those reported for <z:chebi fb="6" ids="17296">aniline</z:chebi> N-oxygenation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Reductive reactions, however, eliminate the N-oxygenation products at markedly higher rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As judged from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>-free single-pass liver perfusion experiments, N-hydroxy-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17698">chloramphenicol</z:chebi> is reduced at rates faster than 300 nmole/min/g liver wet, and nitrosochloramphenicol is eliminated at rates faster than 1.5 mumole/min/g liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At least two <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi>- and two <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16908">NADH</z:chebi>-dependent cytosolic enzymes are responsible for nitrosochloramphenicol reduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Determination of the kinetic parameters of these enzymes by stop-flow analysis revealed the contribution of enzymes, one of it being alcohol dehydrogenase, with Michaelis constants in the micromolar range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Despite this high reducing capacity, about 10% of nitrosochloramphenicol reacted with GSH under formation of glutathionesulfinamidochloramphenicol and GSSG released from the liver into bile and venous effluent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At high nitrosochloramphenicol load these reactions led to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of the liver, caused membrane damage, and impaired bile production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At low nitrosochloramphenicol load, i.e. below 0.5 mumole/min/g, no relevant nitrosochloramphenicol passed the liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These data together with the previously reported reactions of nitrosochloramphenicol within human blood suggest that nitrosochloramphenicol, if formed at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> in the intestine or liver, is rather unlikely to be transferred to the critical target </plain></SENT>
