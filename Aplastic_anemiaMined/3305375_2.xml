<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 55 of 58 treatment periods which could be analyzed (95%), a transient sharp increase of serum IgE was detected, irrespective of the initial diagnosis and mode of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A second IgE peak was recorded in 16% of evaluable treatment periods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the transplanted <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> patients, the rise of serum IgE levels occurred at the same time, i.e. at a mean of 14 days after transplantation; it occurred significantly later in children grafted for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004430'>severe combined immunodeficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In children who received immunosuppression for the treatment of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, IgE elevations were always seen within 2 weeks after institution of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No relation was found between either the occurrence of clinically <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> after treatment, and the time of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of IgE elevations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that the phenomenon of IgE peaks in the population of patients investigated was due to disturbance of T-cell regulation, i.e. a temporary impairment of T-suppressor cell activity </plain></SENT>
