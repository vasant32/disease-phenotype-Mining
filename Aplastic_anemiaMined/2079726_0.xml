<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients received bone marrow from HLA matched/mixed lymphocyte culture negative siblings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In our regimen the "inverted Y" field to irradiate the pelvic nodes was modified, which did not include the whole pelvic cavity in an attempt to protect the ovaries from irradiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although some of the pelvic nodes was supported not to be irradiated in order to protect the ovaries, engraftment occurred in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> five patients including four who had been transfused prior to transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> five are alive from 47 days to 1378 days (median 285 days) after transplantation without transplantation-associated complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The calculated dose to the ovaries was sixteen percent of the entire dose of the regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both of the two evaluable patients that had received transplantation just before or during the puberty are developing <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> sex maturity including menstruation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This study suggests that our preparative regimen is effective not only for engraftment of the donor marrow but also for protecting the ovaries from irradiation </plain></SENT>
