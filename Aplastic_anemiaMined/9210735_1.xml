<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Between March 1991 and May 1995, physicians diagnosed four cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo>, one case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e>, and one case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> among children who resided in a small town near Barcelona that contained 4,237 inhabitants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The four cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> represented a significant excess of observed cases (26.4/100,000 for children age 0-14 y [p &lt; .005]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The authors conducted an epidemiological study of the population to explore the possible "local" role of agents hypothesized or known to be potentially associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo>, as well as with other hematopoietic diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The small town in which the cases lived is a residential area without known or suspected industrial exposures associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, it is located in a county ("Maresme") that boasts having the most flower-growing and agricultural undercover producing area in Catalonia; consequently, copious amounts of <z:chebi fb="95" ids="24527">herbicides</z:chebi> and pesticides are used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The small number of cases limited the testing of the hypothesis of a causal relationship between environmental <z:chebi fb="239" ids="25944">pesticide</z:chebi> exposure or a <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> (the only factors common to the cases) and the excess of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Despite the weaknesses inherent in our study, the information gleaned from our research may be useful to researchers who define local health-related problems </plain></SENT>
