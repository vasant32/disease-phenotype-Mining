<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The outcomes associated with simultaneous bilateral tunneled internal jugular infusion catheter placement in the HSCT recipient population were investigated in an attempt to determine whether simultaneous introduction of these catheters compounds or magnifies the risks (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004936'>venous thrombosis</z:hpo>) associated with tunneled catheters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients undergoing HSCT and receiving bilateral tunneled infusion catheters in a single procedure were identified using a quality assurance data base </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Medical records for the duration of catheterization were reviewed; 43 patients were included in the study (mean age, 42 years; range, 22-56) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Diagnoses included <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (n = 4), <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (n = 8), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (n = 2), <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (n = 17), <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> (n = 1), Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 1), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> (n = 4), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011974'>myelofibrosis</z:hpo> (n = 2), and non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (n = 4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was performed to determine differences in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> rates between dual- and triple-lumen catheters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Forty-three pairs of catheters were placed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> met venous access needs for HSCT recipient care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Complete follow-up was achieved for 77 of 87 (89%) catheters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The overall <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> rate was 0.25 per 100 catheter-days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The rate was 0.19 and 0.33 for dual- and triple-lumen catheters, respectively (P =.15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Mechanical failure did not differ between catheter types (dual: 0.14 episodes per 100 days, triple: 0.05 per 100 days, P =.2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Bilateral multilumen tunneled infusion catheter placement in a single procedure using imaging guidance is safe with acceptable outcomes and meets venous access needs for HSCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There is a trend toward higher <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> rates, with more lumens and more mechanical failure with dual-lumen catheters </plain></SENT>
