<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AIM: To study the clinico-hematological profile and etiological factors of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> syndrome in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SETTING AND DESIGN: This prospective study was carried out in the Department of Pediatrics of a university teaching hospital over 36 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> (Hb 9 /L, platelet count&lt;100x10(9)/L) and bone marrow cellularity&lt;25% were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>History of exposure to drugs, socioeconomic status, ethnicity and occupation of father were noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo>; trephine biopsy; Ham test; <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> studies for <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> A, B and C; and cytogenetic investigations were carried out </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Relative risk was estimated by odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) in matched cases and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 53 children studied, 6 (11.3%) were diagnosed as Fanconi <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two cases had features of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Forty-five children were labeled as acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, of whom one had evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> B <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and two patients (5.8%) had <z:hpo ids='HP_0004818'>paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>Aplastic anemia</z:hpo> was more common in children from family with lower socioeconomic status; in Muslims; and where the father's occupation was <z:mp ids='MP_0008913'>weaving</z:mp>, dyeing and painting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, the number was small to make statistically significant conclusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>No correlation could be established with exposure to drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Fanconi <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> was responsible for approximately one-tenth of the cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Majority of the patients had acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>Hepatitis</z:hpo> B <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> was an uncommon cause of acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
