<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) can cure the <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo>, but it does not eliminate the risks of other complications, for which life-long surveillance is required </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002206'>Pulmonary fibrosis</z:hpo> is a progressive and lethal complication of DC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CASE PRESENTATION: In this report, we describe a patient with DC who developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0002206'>pulmonary fibrosis</z:hpo> seven years after HSCT for severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, and was successfully treated with bilateral lung transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also performed a systematic literature review to understand the burden of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024115" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary disease</z:e> in patients with DC who did or did not receive an HSCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Including our patient, we identified 49 DC patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024115" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary disease</z:e> (12 after HSCT and 37 without HSCT), and 509 with no reported pulmonary complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our current case and literature review indicate that pulmonary morbidity is one of the major contributors to poor quality of life and reduced long-term survival in DC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We suggest that lung transplantation be considered for patients with DC who develop <z:hpo ids='HP_0002206'>pulmonary fibrosis</z:hpo> with no concurrent evidence of multi-organ failure </plain></SENT>
