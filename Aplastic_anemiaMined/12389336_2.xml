<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>HPV is also suspected of playing a role in the pathogenesis of various <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> inflammatory and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo>, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001370'>rheumatoid arthritis</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026691" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="MLNS|MCLS">Kawasaki disease</z:e> and multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: To study the age distribution and clinical presentation of patients hospitalized for human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">parvovirus B19 infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: We reviewed the case records of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> pediatric patients with serologic evidence of HPV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> who were admitted during a 20 month period to a major community hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of 128 children tested for HPV, 48 had evidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> based on the presence of immunoglobulin M antibodies; 8 patients who also had positive IgM for other viruses were excluded, thus 40 case records were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mean age of the patients was 5.21 years, but 22 patients were under 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The clinical presentations included 25 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, either recurrent or prolonged, accompanied in some by <z:mp ids='MP_0000691'>enlarged spleen</z:mp>, liver and lymph nodes, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000988'>skin rash</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003040'>arthropathy</z:hpo>; the remaining patients were investigated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000988'>skin rash</z:hpo>, joint complaints and <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, HPV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> was documented in several well-defined clinical conditions, such as SLE, vasculitic <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo>, pure red cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100653'>optic neuritis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In a group of 40 pediatric patients exhibiting anti-HPV IgM antibodies, a younger age and less common clinical presentations were observed, furthermore 5 patients had clinical syndromes in which the causative role of HPV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> was not clear </plain></SENT>
