<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The effects of native thrombospondin (TSP), an 18 kd recombinant protein comprising residues 1-174 of TSP (TSP1-174) with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>-binding domain and a fusion protein comprising residues 559-669 of TSP (TSP559-669) on murine hematopoiesis, were studied by using different in vitro culture systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>TSP by itself did not show an inhibitory effect on colony-forming unit-megakaryocyte (CFU-MK) growth in a serum-free agar system and on the growth of colony-forming unit-granulocyte and macrophage (CFU-GM) in a plasma clot system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It was, however, found that in the plasma clot culture system when using <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> serum as the source of thrombopoietin or C-Mpl ligand (TPO), TSP and TSP1-174, but not TSP559-669, were able to inhibit the growth of CFU-MK from unfractionated and lineage negative (Lin-) bone marrow cells in a dose-dependent manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A statistically significant suppression was seen at 1 microg/ml of TSP and 5 microg/ml of TSP1-174 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This inhibitory effect of TSP was further found in both the serum-free agar system and the plasma clot system without <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> serum, where megakaryocyte colony growth was stimulated by recombinant TPO, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), or interleukin-3 (IL-3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53448">methylcellulose</z:chebi> system, where a combination of stem cell factor (SCF), IL-3, and granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) were used, TSP inhibited the growth of colony-forming unit-granulocyte-erythroblast, megakaryocyte, and macrophage (CFU-GEMM) but not CFU-GM and burst-forming unit-erythroblast (BFU-E) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, this inhibitory effect of TSP on megakaryocyte colony growth could be counteracted by Fraxiparin, a low-molecular-weight <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that TSP is a negative modulator of megakaryocytopoiesis and suggest that its inhibitory effect is at least partially mediated by N-terminal <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi>-binding domain </plain></SENT>
