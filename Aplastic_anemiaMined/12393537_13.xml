<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> is often associated with bone marrow suppressive conditions, such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One hypothetical mechanism for the clonal expansion of GPI(-) cells in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> is that the mutant cells escape attack by autoreactive cytotoxic cells that are thought to be responsible for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we studied 2 model systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>First, we made pairs of GPI(+) and GPI(-) EL4 cells that expressed major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules and various types of ovalbumin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When the GPI-anchored form of ovalbumin was expressed on GPI(+) and GPI(-) cells, only the GPI(+) cells presented ovalbumin to ovalbumin-specific CD4(+) T cells, indicating that if a putative autoantigen recognized by cytotoxic cells is a GPI-anchored protein, GPI(-) cells are less sensitive to cytotoxic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Second, antigen-specific as well as alloreactive CD4(+) T cells responded less efficiently to GPI(-) than GPI(+) cells in proliferation assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In vivo, when GPI(-) and GPI(+) fetal liver cells, and CD4(+) T cells alloreactive to them, were cotransplanted into irradiated hosts, the contribution of GPI(-) cells in peripheral blood cells was significantly higher than that of GPI(+) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results obtained with the second model suggest that certain GPI-anchored protein on target cells is important for recognition by T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results provide the first experimental evidence for the hypothesis that GPI(-) cells escape from immunologic attack </plain></SENT>
