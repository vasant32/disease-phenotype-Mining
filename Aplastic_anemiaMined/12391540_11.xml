<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Currently, one of the most primitive human hematopoietic progenitor cells that can be functionally assayed in vitro is the long-term culture-initiating cell (LTC-IC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This assay identifies primitive cells that are capable of producing colonies after five weeks of long-term culture using a limiting dilution method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Previous investigators have demonstrated a significant reduction in the frequency of LTC-IC in bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMC) isolated from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> patients when compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, immunosuppression of hematopoiesis is a prevalent feature of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we assayed the frequency of LTC-IC in cells expressing the CD34 antigen isolated from bone marrow, a population highly enriched for LTC-IC, of both <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> patients that had received immunosuppressive therapies (IST, n=13) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> donors (n=28), thereby minimizing continued immunosuppression by T-cells and regulation by other autologous CD34- cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We describe a significant reduction of LTC-IC frequency in purified CD34+ populations from aplastic patients (P&gt;0.0001), thus demonstrating a functional difference between this phenotypically defined cell population from patients and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> donors </plain></SENT>
