<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An annual incidence in Bangkok of 3.7 cases per million population, about twice as high as in Western countries, has been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To evaluate the etiologic role of drugs, 253 subjects were compared with 1,174 hospital controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With multivariate adjustment for confounding, a significant association was identified for exposure 2 to 6 months before admission to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50264">thiazide</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="40" ids="35498">diuretics</z:chebi> (relative risk estimate 7.7; 1.5 to 40) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were crude associations with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35358">sulfonamides</z:chebi> (relative risk estimate, 7.9; P = 0.004) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6704">mebendazole</z:chebi> (6.3; P = 0.03) (there were insufficient data for multivariate adjustment) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Excess risks for the three drugs were in the range of 9 to 12 cases per million users </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no significant association with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17698">chloramphenicol</z:chebi>, although the multivariate relative-risk estimate was elevated (2.7; 0.7 to 10) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Other drugs that have been reported to increase the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, such as <z:chebi fb="2" ids="35475">nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35623">anticonvulsants</z:chebi>, were not commonly used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were no associations with commonly used drugs, including <z:chebi fb="13" ids="22720">benzodiazepines</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="5" ids="37956">antihistamines</z:chebi>, oral contraceptives, and herbal preparations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> associated drugs, the overall etiologic fraction (the proportion of cases attributable to an exposure) was 5%, compared with 25% in Europe and Israel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Drugs are uncommon causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> in Thailand, and their use does not explain the relatively high incidence of the disease in that country </plain></SENT>
