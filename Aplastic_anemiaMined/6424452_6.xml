<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Because of frequent unavailability of HLA-compatible platelets or their inefficiency in increasing platelet counts in patients requiring platelet transfusions, platelet refractoriness remains a major problem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since human gamma globulin has been shown to interfere with the binding of platelet-reactive immunoglobulin G (IgG) to platelets in vitro, and since gamma globulin has proved effective in reversing destruction of platelets in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001973'>idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura</z:hpo>, we decided to investigate intravenous gamma globulin as an adjunct to random-donor platelet transfusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied three patients, one with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, and two with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When a total dose of 2 g/kg of body weight of intravenous gamma globulin was infused over five to six days in these patients, two of them showed a remarkable increment in platelet counts and improved hemostasis with random-donor platelet transfusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We conclude that intravenous gamma globulin may be used in critical situations to improve the response of patients refractory to random-donor platelet transfusions </plain></SENT>
