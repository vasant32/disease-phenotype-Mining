<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess quantitative and qualitative differences in water components between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow and reactive hematopoietic marrow in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> using magnetic resonance (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e>) spectroscopy with variable echo times (TEs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Water content, T2 value of the water component, and signal change in water related to TE were assessed in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow and reactive hematopoietic bone marrow by a stimulated echo acquisition mode with TEs of 30, 45, 60, and 90 ms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Six patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (13-84 years) and seven <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> volunteers (25-38 years) were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Reactive hematopoietic marrow showed significantly higher water content than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The T2 value of water components tended to be longer in reactive hematopoietic marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Water signal ratio related to TE was significantly higher in reactive hematopoietic marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results suggest a quantitative and qualitative difference in water components between <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and reactive hematopoietic bone marrow </plain></SENT>
