<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A total of 304 children under the age of 15 years with acquired severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (SAA) received immunosuppressive therapy (IS) (n = 133) or a matched bone marrow transplant (BMT) (n = 171) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The projected 10-year survival is 48% and 63% respectively (p = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Results following BMT have improved considerably over the years from 49% in 1970-80, to 70% in 1981-83 (p = 0.002) and to 81% between 1984-88 (p = 0.08) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Other favorable prognostic factors are the use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> (p = 0.004), no previous therapy (p = 0.006) and early BMT (p = 0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis only the year of treatment proved significant (p = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, results of IS are greatly dependent on the severity of pre-treatment <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> with survival of 56% versus 37% for neutrophils more or less than 0.2 x 10(9)/l (p = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Poor survival was associated in univariate analysis with female sex (43%), post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> SAA (37%), children not receiving <z:chebi fb="5" ids="50113">androgens</z:chebi> (38%) and patients younger than 5 years (35%), especially if associated with a low neutrophil count (11%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis only the degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> proved significant (p = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that IS is a satisfactory alternative therapy for children with moderately SAA in the absence of an HLA-identical sibling, although BMT remains the treatment of choice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In children under 5 years with very SAA, results with IS are so poor that a search for an unrelated matched donor is justified as early as possible </plain></SENT>
