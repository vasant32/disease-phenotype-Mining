<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several polymorphisms also exist in the TERC gene, making functional testing of potential pathogenic mutations essential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we have tested <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and mutant TERC molecules in 2 telomerase reconstitution assays, 1 in vitro and 1 in transfected telomerase-negative cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We find that 2 polymorphic mutations G58A and G228A have no effect on telomerase activity in these assays, whereas 6 mutations found in DC and AA cause reduction or abolition of telomerase activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the pseudoknot region of the TERC molecule, C72G, 96-7DeltaCT, GC107-8AG and 110-3DeltaGACT reduce the catalytic activity of reconstituted telomerase, whereas mutations in the 3' portion of the molecule C408G and a deletion of the 3' 74 bases have <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> activity in vitro but reduced intracellular activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By analyzing second site mutations that recreate regions of secondary structure but retain the pathogenic mutations we show that mutations C72G, GC107-8AG, and C408G act by disrupting the secondary structure or folding of TERC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, experiments reconstituting telomerase with both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and mutant TERC molecules suggest the mutations act via haploinsufficiency rather than by a dominant-negative mechanism </plain></SENT>
