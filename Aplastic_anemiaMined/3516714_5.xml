<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report here the results of serial bone marrow fibroblast cultures from recipients of histocompatible allogeneic bone marrow transplants (37 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo>, and seven with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mean value of marrow CFU-F growth for recipients at day 21 after transplant was significantly lower than that for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normals</z:mpath> and for patients before transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There were no obvious differences in the morphologic, ultrastructural, and cytochemical characteristics of the CFU-F between the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normals</z:mpath> and the patients who received transplants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The number of stromal CFU-F cells in S phase was increased during the early period after transplantation, as demonstrated by a significant reduction of CFU-F growth after short exposure to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44423">hydroxyurea</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the return to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> was rapid, within six weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-vs-host disease</z:e> (greater than or equal to grade II) and the choice of immunosuppressive drug, i.e., <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi>, did not affect the CFU-F recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The findings in the present study show that the marrow stromal compartment is compromised after marrow transplantation, but its regeneration is rapid </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No in vitro CFU-F growth was obtained from peripheral blood of donors and patients, either before or after bone marrow transplant </plain></SENT>
