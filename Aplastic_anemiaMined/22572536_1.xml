<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To investigate the correlations between polymorphisms of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A, HLA-B and HLA-DRB1 alleles and childhood susceptibility to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA), 80 children with AA were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among the 80 children, 74 had severe AA (SAA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Blood samples were collected from 109 healthy children as the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>High-resolution genotyping of HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-DRB1 alleles was conducted using polymerase chain reaction amplification with sequence-specific primers and polymerase chain reaction amplification with sequence-based typing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expression frequencies of HLA-B*48:01 and DRB1*09:01 were significantly higher and the frequencies of HLA-B*51:01, DRB1*03:01 and DRB1*11:01 were significantly lower in the AA group compared with those in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, the frequencies of HLA-B*48:01 and DRB1*09:01 were significantly higher and the frequencies of HLA-B*51:01, DRB1*03:01 and DRB1*11:01 were significantly lower in the SAA group compared with those in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>HLA-B*48:01 and DRB1*09:01 were correlated with childhood AA, and thus they may be susceptibility genes for childhood SAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>HLA-B*51:01, DRB1*03:01 and DRB1*11:01 are expressed at low levels in children with AA </plain></SENT>
