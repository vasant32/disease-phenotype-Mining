<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Post-transplantation <z:hpo ids='HP_0005523'>lymphoproliferative disorder</z:hpo> (PTLD) is usually an aberrant proliferation of EBV-infected B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report the case of a 31-year-old man with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> who suffered PTLD 42 days post-BMT from an unrelated donor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of PTLD, peripheral blood lymphocytes were comprised of 40% CD20(+) cells, 3% CD4(+) cells, and 56% CD8(+) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A highly sensitive in situ hybridization (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">ISH</z:e>) method was used to detect EBV-encoded small non-polyadenylated <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> 1 (EBER-1) in 33.9% of sorted CD20(+) cells, 4.4% of CD4(+) cells, and 1.4% of CD8(+) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each T-cell fraction contained less than 0.034% of contaminated EBV-infected B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Clonal proliferation of both B and T cells was demonstrated by Southern blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patient did not respond to donor leukocyte infusion and died due to deterioration of PTLD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At autopsy, examination of multiple organs revealed B-cell (rather than T-cell) infiltration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This case clearly indicates that EBV can simultaneously infect B and T cells and can induce clonal proliferation of both lymphocyte subsets in severely immunocompromised patients </plain></SENT>
