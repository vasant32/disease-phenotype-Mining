<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have analysed the contribution to megakaryocyte colony formation in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53448">methylcellulose</z:chebi> made by human plasma, serum, media conditioned by phytohemagglutinin (PHA) stimulated leukocytes (PHA-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LCM</z:e>), erythropoietin (EPO) preparations, and platelets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The culture system was used as a bioassay for megakaryocyte colony stimulating activity (Meg-CSA) in plasma samples of patients with perturbed megakaryocytopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Preparations of heparinized platelet-poor plasma yielded the most consistent results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Platelet-poor plasma of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects will at best facilitate the occasional growth of small megakaryocyte colonies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Colony frequency and size are reproducibly enhanced in the presence of PHA-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LCM</z:e> as a source of exogenous Meg-CSA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Commercially available EPO preparations may vary in their content of activities that influence megakaryocyte colony formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Addition of these preparations to cultures that contain plasma and PHA-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LCM</z:e> usually does not enhance colony formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast to platelet-poor plasma, platelet rich plasma and serum are less supportive of megakaryocyte colony growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that this loss of activity may be related to the release of inhibitors by activated platelets or alternatively caused by absorption of activities by platelets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Plasma samples from patients with megakaryocytopoietic dysfunction may contain components that promote colony formation without addition of PHA-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LCM</z:e> or EPO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This phenomenon is consistently observed for patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and bone marrow transplant recipients after completion of their ablative preparative regimen </plain></SENT>
