<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The most common type of such donors are the HLA phenotypically or HLA-D phenotypically identical related donors </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The studies in <z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp> have demonstrated that HLA-D compatibility in spite of HLA-A or B incompatibilities can be tolerated and there is now accumulating evidence that even patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> can be successfully treated with such bone marrow grafts </plain></SENT>
