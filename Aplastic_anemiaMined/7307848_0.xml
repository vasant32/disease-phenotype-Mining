<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two tracers were used for visualization of the marrow: 99mTc-sulphur-colloid and 111InCl3, some patients being examined by both indicators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>111InCl3 is bound on transferrin and is adsorbed on the surface of reticulocytes and erythroblasts) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The scintillation camera PHO GAMMA SEARLE IV fitted with moving table and computer CLINCOM was used, so that whole body images were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The comparison of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> scans and marrow puncture smears was done </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> with both hyperplastic or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151773" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoplastic marrow</z:e> good correlation of bone marrow scans and sternal puncture smears was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In several cases the scintigraphic examination helped to establish a diagnosis of marrow <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> state </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A peculiar disadvantage of the imaging method with either 99mTc-sulphur-colloid or 111InCl3 is that it shows the disorders in erythropoietic and reticuloendothelial cells, whereas the defects in myelopoietic cell series and platelet precursors are not provable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>According to literature data, great attention is paid to the prognostic value of scintigraphic examination in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
