<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we report on two functional mouse anti-human CD40L monoclonal antibodies 1B1 and 4F1 characterized by flow cytometry, Western blotting, and competition assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The antibodies bound to distinct CD40L <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> and therefore resulted in different bioactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Both antibodies could induce CD4+ T-cell alloantigenic hyporesponsiveness ex vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The antibodies were matched to develop a two-site enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for soluble CD40L (sCD40L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Using this ELISA assay, we found major differences between plasma and serum sCD40L levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Because the count of platelet sharply decreased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001973'>idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi>), we further analyzed the sCD40L concentration in the plasma of AA and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the sCD40L in serum was much lower than that of healthy subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data demonstrate that platelets seem to be a major contributor to sCD40L, though not the only source of sCD40L in serum </plain></SENT>
