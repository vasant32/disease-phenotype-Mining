<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Marrow transplantation was attempted in a 13-yr-old boy with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004810'>congenital hypoplastic anemia</z:hpo> who had never responded to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Prior to the transplant, he had received 238 transfusions, at least 12 of which were from his father </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>He was prepared for grafting with antilymphocyte globulin, procarbazine, and total body irradiation (1000 rads) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient, whose red cells were Group B, then received marrow cells from his Group O, histocompatible, sister </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thereafter, reticulocytes, Group O erythrocytes, and female leukocytes appeared in the peripheral blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Erythroid precursors were seen in the patient's marrow for the first time in his life, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> lacked fluorescent Y chromosomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Dividing cells were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> female </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After initially progressing well, the patient developed interstitial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> and died 55 days after the transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The successful erythroid graft suggested that this patient's failure to produce red blood cells was due to a defective stem cell rather than to a humoral defect, plasma inhibitor, or abnormal marrow microenvironment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It suggested further that sibling marrow may be engrafted in patients who have received multiple transfusions, even from a parent </plain></SENT>
