<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To determine the usefulness of the H1 system, we applied it to 14 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> and 19 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We revealed interesting cytogram patterns in several patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo>, ALL (L2), ALL (L3), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (M7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the basophil and lobularity cytogram, their blast cells were clustered mainly in the blast box </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, a small cluster appeared in the basophil area and was expressed as pseudo-basophilia of 4.4%, 9.6%, and 21%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We speculated that not only <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> basophils but also some type of leukemic blasts could be resistant to rupture of the cell membrane induced by a surfuctant at a low pH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Characteristics of H1 cytogram and histogram pattern have hardly been reported in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>From the analysis of H1 pattern of 19 cases, we found that the (1) the values of RDW and HDW were high in comparison to those for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls and (2) the MPXI (mean peroxidase activity index) was significantly low at the time of diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MPXI had declined at the terminal stage in cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These characteristics were concluded to be useful in clinicopathological diagnosis using the H1 automatic hematological system </plain></SENT>
