<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In a previous pharmacokinetic study in Alzheimer patients great inter-individual variation and low oral bioavailability of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="37733">cholinesterase inhibitor</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45980">tacrine</z:chebi> (tetrahydroaminoacridine, THA) were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present investigation oral and rectal administration of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45980">tacrine</z:chebi> were compared with the aim to find a route for improved bioavailability through diminished first-pass metabolism in the liver </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eight patients suffering from Alzheimer's <z:hpo ids='HP_0000726'>dementia</z:hpo> were given <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45980">tacrine</z:chebi> by oral (25 and 50 mg b.i.d.) and rectal (12.5 and 25 mg b.i.d.) routes for 1 week with 4-6 weeks washout in between </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Drug hydroxylation capacity in the patients was determined using the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34665">debrisoquine</z:chebi> test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45980">tacrine</z:chebi> in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were determined and the cognitive performance was examined by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Alzheimer Deficit Assessment Scale (ADAS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="45980">Tacrine</z:chebi> was well tolerated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one patient, a slow hydroxylator, who developed an <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MMSE and ADAS scores did not significantly change, except for word recall which was improved on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45980">tacrine</z:chebi> when given by the rectal route </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Pharmacokinetic analysis of the two administration routes revealed that the drug dose may be reduced by almost 50% when given rectally compared to orally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Concentrations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45980">tacrine</z:chebi> in the CSF were significantly lower and correlated linearly with the concentrations in plasma </plain></SENT>
