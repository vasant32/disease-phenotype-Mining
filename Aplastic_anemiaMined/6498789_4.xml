<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Endoreduplication was increased in stimulated peripheral lymphocytes in several investigations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Chromosome breaks were shown to be near the control frequency, although chromatid exchange figures and dicentrics were present </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic analysis was extended to the three children of our patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Abnormal clones were detected in bone marrow preparations of our patient in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cytogenetic investigations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At the first examination, two of these clones were prevalent, with their karyotypes being 48,XX, +9, +16 and 46,XX,dup(1)(q24----q32),t(17;?)(p12-13;?) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The prevailing karyotype after 2 years was 46,XX,t(17;?)(p12-13;?) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Involvement of chromosomes #1 and #17 is discussed, taking into account data from the literature concerning several human <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
