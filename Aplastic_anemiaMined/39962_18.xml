<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two of the patients were healthy and 22 had mild to moderately severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-vs-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patient mononuclear cells (of donor origin) were tested for their ability to suppress the responses of lymphocytes obtained from the respective marrow donors to alloantigens in mixed leukocyte culture (MLC) and/or to concanavalin A (Con A) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Tests were carried out between 199 and 2393 (median 376) days after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cells from only 1 of 22 patients without <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD showed suppression of donor cell blastogeneis responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, cells from 11 of 22 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD showed more than 30% suppression of donor cell responses in MLC and/or to Con A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The finding of suppressor cells was not related to the time of testing after grafting nor to immmunosuppressive therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Nonspecific suppressor activity was abrogated by irradiation with 1600 rads in vitro in five of six cases tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nonspecific suppressor cells may be one explanation for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0004430'>severe combined immunodeficiency</z:hpo> and the recurrent infectious complications characteristic of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD </plain></SENT>
