<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The results showed: (1) karyotypes and SCD values were both <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in more than 90% of AA, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> and other known <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemias</z:hpo>, but they were both abnormal in about 35.6% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and only 13.0% of RA/AA, RA/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> or RA/HA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These results indicated that cytogenetic techniques were useful in hematological clinic and that RA/AA, or RA/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> or RA/HA might be pre-RA or atypic RA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This was supported by the results of following up on some RA/AA, RA/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> or RA/HA cases, (2) clonal abnormal karyotypes were found in 64.4% of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The recurrent chromosomal alterations were +8, 20q-, -5/5q-, -7/7q-, similar to those reported in literatures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>(3) 16 MDS cases were followed up and 15 MDS with SCD negative, but one with SCD positive developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> in our hospital </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>(4) Because more structural chromosome alterations occur in SCD negative than SCD positive <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, the numerous chromosome alterations (<z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp>) might occur in earliest development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> into <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
