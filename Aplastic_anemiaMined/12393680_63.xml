<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Immunosuppression with antithymocyte globulin, (<z:chebi fb="36" ids="29309">methyl</z:chebi>)<z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> is considered the treatment of choice for the patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> without a donor for standard-risk stem cell transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This consensus is supported by the results of several series, including a randomized German trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here we report 11-year results of the latter trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With stringent response criteria and 4 months as the time to evaluate responses, this analysis confirms the superiority of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> regimen regarding the response rate in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients treated (70% vs 41%, with or without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi>; P =.015) and in patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (65% vs 31%; P =.011) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients responded more rapidly after treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> (median, 60 vs 82 days; P =.019) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Most patients treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> needed only one course of immunosuppression, whereas many patients treated without <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> required repeated immunosuppressive treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Because of the efficacy of salvage treatment, overall survival was not different between the 2 treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, failure-free survival favored the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> regimen (39% vs 24%; P =.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The relapse rate, projected at 38% after 11.3 years, was similar between the 2 treatment groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Remissions were <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> dependent in 26% of the patients responding to a regimen that included <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Clonal or malignant diseases developed in 25% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These data demonstrate that antithymocyte globulin, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> are an effective regimen for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, remissions are unstable, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277555" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">secondary diseases</z:e> are common </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In contrast to the results of stem cell transplantation, most patients are not cured </plain></SENT>
