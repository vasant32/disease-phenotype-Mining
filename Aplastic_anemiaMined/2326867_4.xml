<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients were young children with primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiencies</z:hpo> (n = 31), other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inherited diseases</z:e> (n = 4), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (n = 2), or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty-nine received an HLA-nonidentical marrow and nine an HLA-identical marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum monoclonal immunoglobulins were detected by the immunofixation method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Monoclonal immunoglobulins were found in 26 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Monoclonal components were more frequently detected in patients with primary severe <z:mp ids='MP_0001831'>T cell deficiencies</z:mp> (21/25) rather than in the other patients (6/13) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 7 of 29 recipients of HLA-nonidentical transplants, versus 0 out of 9 recipients of HLA-identical transplants, serum monoclonal immunoglobulins were found associated with a B lymphocyte proliferation syndrome due to an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0149678" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Epstein-Barr virus infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In this group, monoclonal immunoglobulins were detected early, prior to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of the clinical syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The simultaneous occurrence of several monoclonal immunoglobulins was more frequent in these patients, while monoclonal immunoglobulin concentrations increased faster, especially those of IgM isotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These characteristics may allow in patients at risk (recipients with primary T cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiencies</z:hpo> and receiving HLA-nonidentical transplantation) an earlier diagnosis of B lymphocyte proliferative syndrome that may eventually lead to early and more efficient therapy </plain></SENT>
