<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A significantly reduced T4/T8 ratio was found and two of five patients also had a reduced percentage of B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One patient had a high percentage of HLA-DR positive T8+ cells, very suggestive of a high degree of circulating activated T suppressor/cytotoxic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>IL-2 production was reduced in two patients, whereas IFN production was only reduced in one of these </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The abnormalities found correlate with the duration of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patients with the longest duration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> also exhibited the lowest T4/T8 ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No spontaneous IFN production was detected in any of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no clinical benefit or reversal of the immune abnormalities during and following treatment with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="3699">cimetidine</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> A in two patients </plain></SENT>
