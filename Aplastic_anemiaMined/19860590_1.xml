<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system, have been implicated in the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>Aplastic anemia</z:hpo> in various population-based studies, The aim of this study was to determine the role of the HLA Class I and Class II alleles in genetic susceptibility to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>Aplastic anemia</z:hpo> in Pakistani patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>HLA A*, B* and DRB1* alleles were analyzed, in 61 Pakistani patients (Females n = 22, Males n = 39) and the control group consisted of 200 ethnically matched individuals (Females n = 89, Males n = 111) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The allele frequency of DRB1*15 was found significantly higher in patients 0.36 (p = 0.001 with odds ratio = 1.97), as compared to the controls 0.212 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although DRB1*03 percent frequency was significantly higher in controls 0.175 (p = 0.023) with odds ratio = 0.514, as compared to patients 0.106.Therefore DRB1*15 emerged as a susceptible allele and DRB1*03 as a protective allele in Pakistani <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>Aplastic anemia</z:hpo> patients and control samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No significant difference was found in allele frequencies of other HLA class I and HLA class II alleles for both patients and controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three haplotypes A*02 B*40 DRB1*15 (p = 0.021), A*31 B*51 DRB1*13 (p = 0.12) and A*33 B*58 DRB1*15 (p = 0.000) showed significant variations in the two groups </plain></SENT>
