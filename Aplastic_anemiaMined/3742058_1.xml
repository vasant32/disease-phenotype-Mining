<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Untreated human serum is known to be toxic to in vitro assays for erythropoietin, including the mouse spleen cell assay system (MSCA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This phenomenon had previously been shown to be mediated by complement-dependent IgM heteroantibodies and can be overcome by heating the serum at 56 degrees C for 30 minutes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using the MSCA, we have found that the toxic effect of serum could also be removed by treatment with a precipitating antibody against the C3c component of complement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The effects of the two methods of complement inactivation on the measurement of stimulatory activity in serum have been compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> serum, the results after heat inactivation and antibody treatment were similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, serum from a patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> gave a result equivalent to 327 mU erythropoietin/ml after heat treatment, but after antibody treatment equivalent to 1,520 mU erythropoietin/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Gel permeation chromatography of unheated, heated, and antibody-treated sera showed that heating markedly reduced the activity of the erythropoietin peak </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Seventy percent of the activity of partially purified urinary erythropoietin was lost during heating in the presence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In addition, heating caused the appearance of high molecular weight compounds that are stimulatory in the MSCA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The level of this activity appeared to be directly related to the stimulatory activity of the unheated serum </plain></SENT>
