<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>Anemia</z:hpo> in a TNT worker is considered a sentinel health event (occupational) (SHE(O)) in the United States (US) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>Deaths</z:hpo> have been reported secondary to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Studies have shown that TNT systemic absorption is significant by both the respiratory and dermal routes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No studies encountered looked at <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> change or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> cases in respiratory protected workers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is hypothesized that respiratory protection is insufficient to protect TNT workers from the risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> development and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> concentration drop </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A records review of eight groups of respiratory protected TNT workers' pre-exposure <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> levels were compared with their during-exposure <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> levels for statistically significant (alpha level 0.05) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> level changes, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> cases were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A curve estimation analysis was performed between mean TNT air concentrations and mean <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> change values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Statistically significant <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> level drops and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> cases were apparent at TNT air concentrations about the REL and PEL in respiratory protected workers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> cases or statistically significant <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> level drops at concentrations about the TLV, however </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A statistically significant inverse non-linear regression model was found to be the best fit for regressing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> change on TNT air concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory protection may be inadequate to prevent workers who are at risk for TNT skin absorption from developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This study contributes evidence that the TLV should be considered for adoption as the new PEL </plain></SENT>
