<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, CFU-E growth was reduced in mononuclear cell rich fraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In two patients out of five, CFU-E growth was returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> by the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of E-rosette forming cells of monocytes from mononuclear cell rich fraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the patient whose CFU-E growth returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> by the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of E-rosette forming cells, cocultivation between bone marrow buffy coat cells and autologous bone marrow E-rosette forming cells resulted in a significant decrease of CFU-E growth, and there was a significant increase in CFU-E growth by the treatment of OKT 4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In other three patients out of five, there was no significant increase in CFU-E growth by the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of monocytes and/or E-rosette forming cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that immunologic causes such as cellular factors may play a role, at least in part, on the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1260899" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BDS">Diamond-Blackfan syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
