<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 29-year-old man was diagnosed as having <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> at the age of 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At the age of 28, BMT was performed from his HLA-identical sister </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Total volume of blood transfusion before BMT was about 28,000 ml, and in three months after BMT was 8,000 ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The transplantation was successful, but one month after BMT, <z:mp ids='MP_0001337'>dry eyes</z:mp>, skin <z:hpo ids='HP_0001000'>pigmentation</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002240'>hepatomegaly</z:hpo> appeared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serum bile duct enzymes and ferritin also increased remarkably </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Moreover after thirteen months, <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> tolerance impaired seriously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed atrophic pancreas and an increased CT density in the liver and the tail of the pancreas </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A large amount of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_41'>iron deposition</z:mpath> were also found in liver and stomach biopsy specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We concluded that <z:hpo ids='HP_0000819'>diabetes mellitus</z:hpo> was due to secondary hemochtomatosis in the present case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There is a possibility that tissue damage due to iron deposits may have been accelerated through BMT in this patient with a history of many blood transfusions </plain></SENT>
