<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A new rapid method to automatically count reticulated platelets is very recently established by our research group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The principle of the measurement of reticulated platelets is based on flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The platelets are quickly stained with a <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="2" ids="51121">fluorescent dye</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51874">auramine</z:chebi> O and fluorescent intensity (<z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> content) and forward scatter (cell size) are measured in only 80 seconds with a reticulocyte counter, equipped with special software for analysis of reticulated platelets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both of the reproducibility and the linearity were shown to be good </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> percentage value for reticulated platelets was 0.98% +/- 0.41% and its absolute count was 2.12 +/- 0.69 x 10(9)/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The absolute count was decreased in patients with reduced thrombopoiesis such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloblastic leukemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and was elevated in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0040028" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">essential thrombocythemia</z:e> and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001973'>idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura</z:hpo> had a high percentage of reticulated platelets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An apparent rise was noticed in the percentage of reticulated platelets which preceded by several days a progressive increase in the platelet count at the recovery phase of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> in a couple of leukemic patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These suggest that an automated measurement of reticulated platelets can be clinically useful to estimate thrombopoiesis in bone marrow </plain></SENT>
