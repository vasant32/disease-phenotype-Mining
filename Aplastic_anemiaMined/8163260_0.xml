<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We experienced 27 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) during the period of 1984 to 1988 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of these, clinical characteristics of 25 patients who were followed up until <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> or at least for 2 years were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In terms of the degree of the initial hematological impairment, the patients were separated into 3 groups: 9 (36%) in severe, 11 (44%) in moderate, and 5 (20%) in mild impairment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The survival rates in 24 months after diagnosis were 44% in severe, 64% in moderate, and 100% in mild, indicating close relation between the degree of the initial hematological impairment and survival rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>9 patients in a severe group received blood transfusion, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1456831" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">anabolic steroids</z:e> and/or high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi>, but these treatments resulted in an unsatisfactory outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that they need other therapeutic modalities, including bone marrow transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When the initial hematological data were compared between a group of patients who were alive for more than two years and a group of patients who died within two years, the mean granulocyte counts and reticulocyte counts of these two groups showed significant differences </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the mean platelet counts were not significantly different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This indicates that the initial granulocyte count and reticulocyte count are indicators of prognosis in AA, and that the initial platelet count does not influence the prognosis </plain></SENT>
