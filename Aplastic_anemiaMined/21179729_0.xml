<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To study the actions of transcription factors, T-bet and GATA-3, and their relevant signal transduction pathways on the immune-related pathogenesis with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (CAA), and to investigate the immunological regulation mechanism of Shengxue Mixture (SXM) in regulating levels of Th cell imbalance, transcriptional factor and relevant signal pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> CAA patients selected from Yueyang Hospital of Shanghai University of traditional Chinese medicine were equally randomized into the treated group and the control group, 20 patients in each group, and 20 healthy persons were selected as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> group, the former was treated with SXM according to patients' syndrome patterns, namely, SXM-1 was given to patients of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Pi</z:e>-Shen yang-deficiency pattern, and SXM-2 to those of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">Pi</z:e>-Shen yin-deficiency pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients in the control group were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> (CsA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expressions of T-bet, GATA-3, signal transducers and activators of transcription 4 (STAT4) and 6 (STAT6) in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMNC) of patients were determined using real-time fluorescent quantitation polymerase chain reaction before and after treatment, meantime, the Th1/Th2 proportion in peripheral blood, and levels of IFN-gamma, IL-12 and IL-4 in PBMNC-cultured supernatant were detected by flow cytometry and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expressions of PBMNC T-bet and STAT4, ratios of T-bet/GATA-3, Th1 proportion and Th1/Th2 ratio, levels of IFN-gamma and IL-12 in PBMNC-cultured supernatant were <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> significantly higher in CAA patients than in healthy controls (P &lt; 0.01), which were lowered after treatment but didn't reach the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.01), excepting for IL-12 level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Comparisons of the changes between the two treated groups showed insignificant difference (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>While the difference between patients and healthy persons in terms of GATA-3, STAT6, Th2 proportion, and IL-4 were insignificant (P &gt; 0.05), either before or after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Abnormal activation of IFN-gamma/T-bet and IL-12/ STAT4 pathways, as well as Th1/Th2 balance deviating to Th1 excursion play vital roles in the immunological pathogenesis of CAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>SXM and CsA could lower the aforesaid abnormal activation and correct Th1 hyper-polarization, so as to alleviate the over-activated cell-mediated immunity to eliminate hematopoietic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> in CAA patients </plain></SENT>
