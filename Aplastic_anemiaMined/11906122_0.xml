<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> were classified into three subgroups according to severity: mild subgroup (n=14), moderate subgroup (n=12) and severe subgroup (n=5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The decrease in total IgG was recognized in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these three subgroups (p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although IgG1 decreased in severe subgroup (p&lt;0.01), it showed no significant difference in mild and moderate subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The decrease in IgG2 and IgG3 was observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these three subgroups (p&lt;0.001 and p&lt;0.01, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although IgG4 decreased in mild subgroup (p&lt;0.05), it showed no significant difference in moderate and severe subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We speculated that the measurement of IgG subclasses was useful in understanding the pathophysiology of humoral immunity in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
