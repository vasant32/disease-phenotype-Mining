<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While interleukin 10 (IL-10) is a cytokine production inhibitory factor, the possibility of immunosuppressive therapy using IL-10 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> has not been explored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, therefore, we examined the effect of IL-10 on progenitor cells obtained from seven patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our study indicated that IL-10 dramatically enhanced the erythroid colony formation in a dose-dependent manner in two of the seven cases examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When we examined the concentration of cytokines in the culture supernatants of unstimulated bone marrow cells, the spontaneous production of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) was observed in one of these two cases, and this production was completely inhibited by addition of IL-10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings suggested that IL-10 enhanced the erythroid colony formation by inhibiting the pathological production of IFN-gamma in this case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This study provides an experimental support for the clinical application of IL-10 in some patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
