<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The development of a 24 hour radioimmunoassay for erythropoietin (EPO) using EPO derived from recombinant DNA as both immunogen and ligand is described in the present paper </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mixed breed rabbits immunized with 10 micrograms/kg of EPO derived from a stably transfected cell line (Elanex Pharmaceuticals Inc., Bothel, Washington, USA, through McDonnell Douglas Corp., St </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Louis, Missouri, USA; "MD") produced antibodies to EPO with high titer (up to 1:896,000 final dilution in the tube), high affinity (8.4 x 10(11) liter/M), and good specificity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Purified EPO from the above source or from AmGen Biologicals (Thousand Oaks, California, USA; "AG") were successfully radioiodinated with the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53767">chloramine-T</z:chebi> method and used as ligand in the radioimmunoassay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Standard dose-response curves prepared with EPO from both commercial sources were not significantly different and showed a sensitivity of 0.75 to 0.96 mU/tube </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The dose-response curves in both systems also showed parallelism with serially diluted serum from a patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Within-assay and between-assay precision were determined by assaying multiple replicates of a serum pool </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Recovery of exogenous EPO added to a serum pool averaged 97% for both systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The range of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human serum EPO was determined by assaying the sera of 153 hematologically-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> adult subjects and was found to be 1.1 to 27.3 mU/ml for MD EPO and 0.5 to 16.7 mU/ml for AG EPO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Sera from several patients with hematologic abnormalities were also assayed, including those of 36 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>end-stage renal disease</z:hpo> (mean +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>, 29.5 +/- 4.0 mU/ml; P less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, this new, more rapid and sensitive radioimmunoassay system can be used to measure EPO levels in sera from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human subjects and patients with several types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, and should also be very useful in therapeutic drug monitoring of patients receiving EPO from various commercial sources </plain></SENT>
