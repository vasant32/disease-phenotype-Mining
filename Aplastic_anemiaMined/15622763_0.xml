<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The spleen cells of BALB/c miceimmunized with rhG-CSF were fused with <z:mp ids='MP_0009440'>myeloma</z:mp> cell line SP2/0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three murine hybridomas producing monoclonal antibody (McAb) against rhG-CSF were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum levels of G-CSF in 54 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (CAA) were detected by ELISA method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Serum G-CSF levels in 70.4% (38 of 54 cases) of the CAA patients were increased (272.76 +/- 58.39ng/L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a negative correlation between blood neutrophil counts and serum G-CSF levels (r = -0.535, P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CFU-GM were detected in 12 cases of CAA, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> was decreased (17.92 +/- 10.28/2 x 10(5) nucleated cell) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Serum G-CSF levels in almost 30% (12 of 54 cases) of the CAA patients were not increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The hematopoietic progenitor cells of CAA patients were impaired, and some CAA could be treated with rhG-CSF and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressive agents</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
