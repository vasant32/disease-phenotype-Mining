<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In some patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVID</z:e>, a defective btk or CD40-L gene has been found, but most often there is no clearly identified etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Here, 2 unrelated families in whom male members were affected by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVID</z:e> were examined for a defect in the XLP gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In one family previously reported in the literature as having progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0004313'>immunoglobulin deficiencies</z:hpo>, 3 brothers were examined for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002205'>recurrent respiratory infections</z:hpo>, whereas female family members showed only elevated serum immunoglobulin A levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A grandson of one of the brothers died of a severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0851807" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Aspergillus infection</z:e> secondary to progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0004313'>immunoglobulin deficiency</z:hpo>, FIM, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, and B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the second family, 2 brothers had <z:hpo ids='HP_0010976'>B lymphocytopenia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004313'>immunoglobulin deficiencies</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of FIM in a male cousin of the brothers led to the XLP diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Because the SH2D1A gene was found altered in both families, these findings indicate that XLP must be considered when more than one male patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVID</z:e> is encountered in the same family, and SH2D1A must be analyzed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> male patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">CVID</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Moreover, these data link defects in the SH2D1A gene to <z:mp ids='MP_0002144'>abnormal B-lymphocyte development</z:mp> and to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002961'>dysgammaglobulinemia</z:hpo> in female members of families with XLP disease </plain></SENT>
