<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The hematopoietic system in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) shows both quantitative and qualitative deficiencies, i.e., reduced numbers of hematopoietic progenitor cells (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HPC</z:e>) and impaired <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HPC</z:e> proliferation in long-term marrow cultures (LTMC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since recombinant human granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (rhGM-CSF) has been shown to be a potent stimulator of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hematopoiesis, both in vivo and in vitro, in the present study we wanted to assess the possibility of stimulating hematopoiesis in LTMC from 17 patients with AA, by weekly addition of rhGM-CSF (10 ng/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In LTMC from 11 patients (group of responders), rhGM-CSF induced a significant increase (4.8-fold, compared with untreated cultures) in the levels of myeloid progenitor cells; in contrast, in six patients (group of nonresponders), myeloid progenitors were refractory to this cytokine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the group of responders, rhGM-CSF also induced a pronounced increment in the levels of nonadherent and adherent cells (5.99- and 5.18-fold, respectively, compared with untreated cultures) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among the different myelopoietic lineages, rhGM-CSF preferentially stimulated the macrophagic lineage; this was evident both at the progenitor and mature cell levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the effect of rhGM-CSF in LTMC from AA patients was only transient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Indeed, the effects mentioned above were observed only during the first three weeks of culture; afterwards, myeloid progenitor and nonadherent cell levels in treated cultures declined, practically reaching the levels observed in untreated cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At the moment, we do not know whether this transient stimulatory effect is due to the production of inhibitory cytokines, by macrophages generated in response to rhGM-CSF, or to the exhaustion of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HPC</z:e> pool in AA cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 17 patients, rhGM-CSF had no effect on the kinetics of erythroid or multipotent progenitor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results are in keeping with clinical studies in which it has been observed that most AA patients treated with rhGM-CSF show increments in circulating monocytes and granulocytes, as well as in bone marrow cellularity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, little or no effect is observed on erythropoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The actual mechanisms involved in the in vitro effects of rhGM-CSF on myeloid progenitor cells from AA bone marrow are still not completely understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Future studies on this issue should be encouraged, since they may help to understand the in vivo (clinical) effects of this cytokine </plain></SENT>
