<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Impaired hematopoietic growth factor production is a hypothetical contributing factor to the development of acquired severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (SAA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The serum levels of most hematopoietic cytokines in SAA patients are elevated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To measure interleukin-11 levels in newly diagnosed SAA children and attempt to correlate levels with disease severity and response to therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN/METHODS: Following enrollment into a clinical study but prior to treatment, serum samples were obtained from 11 newly diagnosed children with acquired SAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These samples were collected between May 2000 and September 2002 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>IL-11 levels were quantified utilizing an ELISA technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ten of the 11 patients had low or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels of IL-11 (&lt;85 pg/mL) and one had an elevated level of 409 pg/mL (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range 15-200 pg/mL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The production of IL-11 does not increase in response to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> in most children with SAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The significance of this laboratory observation is not clear at this time </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further studies are warranted to determine what, if any, role this plays in the development of this disorder and if the administration of recombinant human IL-11 might be beneficial in the treatment of acquired SAA </plain></SENT>
