<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report a patient who underwent peripheral blood hematopoietic progenitor (PBHP) autologous transplantation for his third SAA relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although his repeated relapses were always successfully reversed by immunosuppression, he developed <z:mp ids='MP_0002531'>anaphylaxis</z:mp> with horse, rabbit and mouse immunoglobulins as a side-effect of his previous treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>He was mobilized with G-CSF and underwent three leukaphereses in the period of hematologic recovery after the second relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fourteen months later, he suffered his third relapse, rescued by autologous PBHP transplantation after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> and melphalan conditioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At present he is 15 months after transplantation without any treatment, transfusion-independent and in good condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Others have published the observation that sufficient PBHP can be collected at least in some patients with SAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our experience shows that in repeatedly relapsing SAA with no other treatment options autologous transplantation with previously collected PBHP can result in successful hematologic reconstitution </plain></SENT>
