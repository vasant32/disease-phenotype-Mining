<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A total of 345 cases hospitalized in our hospital between December 1982 and June 2011 were enrolled into this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We assessed the response rates 3 and 6 months after ATG/ALG, and estimated the overall survival (OS) by Kaplan-Meier method for this cohort of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The cohort of 345 patients was routinely followed-up with a median follow-up of 44.0 (range, 0.5 - 244.0) months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The response rates at 3 and 6 months were 29.9% and 45.4%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The differences in response rates at both 3 (39.2% vs 19.6%, P &lt; 0.01) and 6 months (55.6% vs 34.0%, P &lt; 0.01) between 184 non-severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (mSAA) and 161 very severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (VSAA) were statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The response rates among the different ATG preparations were comparative; but 3-(10.6%) and 6-month (25.5%) responses produced by rATG-Fresenius were significantly inferior to those by rATG-Sangstat (36.6% and 56.6%, respectively) (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 5-year OS was 61.7% (95%CI 55.4% - 68.0%) for the entire cohort of patients, and 5-year OS for mSAA patients \[71.0% (95%CI 62.9% - 79.1%)\] was superior to that of VSAA patients \[50.4% (95%CI 40.1% - 60.7%), P &lt; 0.01\]; but for the patients treated from 2007, the difference of OS in the last 5 years between VSAA and mSAA was not significant \[ 73.7% (95%CI 52.2% - 95.2%) vs 89.7% (95%CI 79.5% - 99.9%); P = 0.24\] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our study also confirmed the superiority of ATG/ALG + CsA regimen \[64.8% (95%CI 57.9% - 71.7%)\] over ATG/ALG alone \[32.6% (95%CI 15.7% - 49.5%)\] with regard to 5-year OS (P &lt; 0.01); but the addition of recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF) to ATG/ALG had no benefit in terms of OS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>rATG-S produced significantly better 5-year OS \[66.1% (95%CI 55.8% - 76.4%)\] than rATG-F \[46.6% (95%CI 35.9% - 57.3%); P &lt; 0.01\] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: (1) The outcome of mSAA was superior to that of VSAA, but the latter was markedly improved in the last 5 years; (2) rATG-F was inferior to rATG-S with regard to 5-year OS; (3) Immunosuppressive treatment with ATG/ALG plus CsA was more effective than ATG/ALG alone; (4) The addition of rhG-CSF to ATG/ALG had no benefit in terms of OS </plain></SENT>
