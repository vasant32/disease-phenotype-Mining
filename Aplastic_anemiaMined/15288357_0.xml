<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Muscles, tendons and other connective tissues ossify after minor trauma, and patients often become encased in a second immobile skeleton </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There is no known cure or treatment for FOP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>It has been found that lymphocytes from FOP patients elaborate excess levels of bone morphogenic protein-4 (BMP-4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Given this, it has been suggested that allogenic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) possibly could be a cure for FOP, and drawn attention to a previously unappreciated case of an FOP patient who had successful BMT for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> with apparent short- and medium-term arresting of the FOP disease process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, BMT has non-trivial associated morbidity and mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Here, it is noted that if B cells are found to be the lymphocytes responsible for excess BMP-4 production in FOP, use of Rituximab, a monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody which effectively targets B cells, could be a less permanent and less risky treatment alternative for FOP </plain></SENT>
