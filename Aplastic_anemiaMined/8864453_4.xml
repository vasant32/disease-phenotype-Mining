<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They were studied a median of 4 years after BMT (1-12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> blood counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients conditioned with radiation-based schemes showed a full donor pattern of hemopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Conversely, out of five patients who received only <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> as conditioning therapy, two of them had a late graft failure (2.4 and 3 years after BMT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One of these relapsing patients had a durable mixed chimerism, which was first detected 1 month after BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results seem to suggest that durable mixed chimerism can antecede graft failure in some patients conditioned only with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, and that a more stringent monitoring can be clinically rewarding in this group of patients </plain></SENT>
