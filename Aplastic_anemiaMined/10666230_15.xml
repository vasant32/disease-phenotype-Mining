<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are at least 8 complementation groups (A through H) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Extensive analyses of the FA group C gene FANCC in Western countries revealed that 10% to 15% of FA patients have mutations of this gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The most common mutation is IVS4 + 4 A to T (IVS4), a splice mutation in intron 4, which has been found only in patients of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When we screened 29 Japanese patients (20 unrelated patients and 4 families) using polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism, we found 8 unrelated patients homozygous for IVS4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This is apparently the first non-Ashkenazi-Jewish population for whom this mutation has been detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The Ashkenazi Jewish patients homozygous for IVS4 have a severe phenotype, in comparison with other FA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our analyses of Japanese patients indicate no significant difference between IVS4 homozygotes and other patients with regard to severity of a clinical phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, ethnic background may have a significant effect on a clinical phenotype in FA patients carrying the same mutation </plain></SENT>
