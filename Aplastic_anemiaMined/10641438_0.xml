<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patient is now 2 years and 6 months from <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, and her hematopoiesis is almost within <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> limits without medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This finding provides new data supporting clonal hematopoiesis in acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> but does not imply that the disease is resistant to immunosuppressive therapy </plain></SENT>
