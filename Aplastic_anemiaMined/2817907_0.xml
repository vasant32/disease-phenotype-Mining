<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These CSFs had been demonstrated to accelerate the recovery from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> after anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> chemotherapy and bone marrow transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CSFs were also effective in some patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> among children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An increase of neutrophils was observed in these patients responding to CSFs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Few patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, however, responded to G-CSF with an increase of reticulocytes and thrombocytes in addition to neutrophils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Combination of G-CSF with anti-leukemic agents for the treatment of refractory and relapsed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> non-lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (ANLL) or as the conditioning for bone marrow transplantation to refractory ANLL patients was found to be quite effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Possible usage of GM-CSF and M-CSF for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> treatment by stimulating anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> functions of monocytes-macrophages was also discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, GM-CSF and M-CSF were demonstrated to decrease serum cholesterol level in rabbits as well as in patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Possible mechanism of this cholesterol-lowering effect was also discussed </plain></SENT>
