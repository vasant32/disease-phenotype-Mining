<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It is quite rare that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> except Fanconi's type occurs in members of a single family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we reported two patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, a 14-year-old female and a 49-year-old her mother </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In both cases, hematological findings were compatible to that of a typical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the case of daughter, CFU-E formation of control bone marrow cells was significantly inhibited by the addition of the patient's bone marrow cells, suggesting the presence of cellular immune mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the case of mother, no inhibitory activity on CFU-C formation of control bone marrow cells was detected in the patient's serum, though the ratio of helper/suppressor T lymphocytes in the peripheral blood was increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We could not sufficiently clarify the common immune mechanism causing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> in both cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It was noticeable, however, that both cases share HLA DR2, which is frequently found in patients with various <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> and is believed to relate closely to the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This evidence suggests the possibility that genetically inherited susceptibility may also be the important factor for causing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
