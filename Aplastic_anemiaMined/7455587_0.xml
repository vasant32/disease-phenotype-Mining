<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Case 1 received 4 units of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e> blood from a unique donor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>During the following week an obvious clinical relief, as well as increase of the peripheral blood values were recorded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, the bone marrow was progressively repopulated with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> precursors and the peripheral blood picture reverted to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
