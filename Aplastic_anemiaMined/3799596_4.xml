<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have postulated that the p-<z:chebi fb="4" ids="16301,29423,29424,29785,29786,33101">NO2</z:chebi> group of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17698">chloramphenicol</z:chebi> (CAP) is the structural feature underlying <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> from this drug </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In a series of studies to examine this hypothesis we have demonstrated the toxic nature of the CAP-reduction intermediate <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35801">nitroso</z:chebi> CAP (NO-CAP) and its damaging effect on isolated DNA in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The present study was designed to examine the comparative effects of CAP, NO-CAP, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32215">thiamphenicol</z:chebi> (TAP) on the integrity of DNA in intact cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By using the alkaline elution technique of Kohn, DNA damage in the form of single strand breaks could be readily demonstrated in cultured Raji cells and in PHA-stimulated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human lymphocytes by small concentrations of NO-CAP (0.05-0.1 mM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A small but reproducible effect was observed from large concentrations of CAP (2 mM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In contrast, TAP, lacking the p-<z:chebi fb="4" ids="16301,29423,29424,29785,29786,33101">NO2</z:chebi> group, was without effect </plain></SENT>
