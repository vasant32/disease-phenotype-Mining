<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patient had <z:mp ids='MP_0002055'>diabetes</z:mp> arising from the <z:mp ids='MP_0005638'>hemochromatosis</z:mp>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0016167" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">anal fissures</z:e>, and a kidney <z:mpath ids='MPATH_612'>abscess</z:mpath> due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>He was treated with a nonmyeloablative preconditioning regimen followed by non-T-cell-depleted (non-TCD) allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) from his human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-haploidentical 2-loci-mismatched sibling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Prompt engraftment of granulocytes and platelets was observed, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> was easy to control </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This report describes the first successful nonmyeloablative hematopoietic stem cell transplant in a heavily transfused SAA patient from an HLA-haploidentical 2-loci-mismatched sibling donor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The result suggests that a long-term fetomaternal microchimerism-positive sibling can be a second-line donor if an alternative HLA-identical donor is not available </plain></SENT>
