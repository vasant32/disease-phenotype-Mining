<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two healthy full-term infants were observed for 7 continuous hours in their homes weekly on weeks 2, 3, 4, and 5 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Code recordings of their behavioral states and any mother-infant interactions were made every 10 seconds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An analysis was made of the distribution of the infant's state behaviors during the time it was left alone (mean = 279.6 minutes in 7 hours) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The states were Waking Active, Quiet Alert, Fuss or Cry, Drowse or Transition, Active Sleep, and Quiet Sleep </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four state profiles were obtained for each infant, one for each week of observation; then a single quantitative measure of profile consistency over weeks was calculated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Infants with the four lowest profile consistency indices had major developmental problems between 3.5 and 30 months (p less than .001): one had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>; a second had <z:hpo ids='HP_0002521'>hypsarrhythmia</z:hpo>, a third died of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SIDS</z:e>, and the fourth was <z:mp ids='MP_0001399'>hyperactive</z:mp>, both at home and in a testing situation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Other infants with low consistency scores showed minor developmental delays at 6 months and at 30 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>None of the infants at the upper end of the consistency continuum showed evidence of any developmental dysfunction by 30 months of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The findings indicate that developmental inconsistency in state organization during the neonatal period is predictive of risk for later development </plain></SENT>
