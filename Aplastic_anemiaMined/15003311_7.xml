<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Similar immune mechanisms have been suggested to operate in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004818'>paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>), and the presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> clones in AA may indicate that an immune reaction directed against hematopoietic stem cells may be responsible for the immune selection pressure leading to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> evolution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We previously described expansions of selective cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) clones in AA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We applied a molecular analysis of the T-cell receptor repertoire to study the characteristics of CTL response in patients with various forms of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Immunodominant T-cell clones were detected using combined flow cytometric and molecular analysis of the variable beta (VB) chain and CDR3 representation, followed by determination of the frequency of individual CDR3 clonotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clonotypic polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed to establish clonotypic utilization pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In patients with a past history of AA, and when subgrouped by current blood counts as "hypoproliferative" <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> patients (in contrast to purely hemolytic form of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>), more pronounced skewing of VB family utilization was found, consistent with T-cell responses involving several immunodominant CTL clones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sequences of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>-derived clonotypes were used to design PCR-based assays for the utilization analysis of individual clones in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The clonotypic distribution pattern established by this PCR method indicated that immunodominant T-cell specificities were shared between some patients but also may be found at low frequencies in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Analysis of the CDR3 sequence pattern as a marker for expanded immunodominant clonotypes may have an application in the study of T-cell responses in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
