<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The incidence was 60% (15/25) with the proportion of severe form (greater than or equal to grade II) being 53% (8/15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Skin involvement was the most common (13/15), gut the second (5/15), and liver the third (4/15) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Most of the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037274" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">skin disease</z:e> were confirmed by biopsy </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The long-term survival rate for cases with grade 0-I disease was 65%, and that for those with grade II-III disease was 38% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariate linear regression analysis of risk factors associated with severe form GVHD showed that the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> was the most significant factor </plain></SENT>
