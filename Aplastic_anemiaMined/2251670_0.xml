<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The 30-month survival can be attained in 42% of the patients given globulin and in 28% of the patients after splenectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In patients with grave <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, it is recommended that the treatment be instituted from the use of antilymphocytic globulin in a dose of 15 mg/kg bw daily for 5 days, provided there are no contraindications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In patients with not grave <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, the results of splenectomy and therapy with antilymphocytic globulin are approximately the same: the 5-year survival amounts to 94 and 93%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the use of globulin may be recommended as a method of choice for the above patients' group, since surgical approaches to the treatment are still coupled with a high risk for the patient's life </plain></SENT>
