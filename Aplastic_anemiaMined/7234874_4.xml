<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Granulocyte precursors (CFU-C) from blood and marrow, and colony-stimulating activity (CSA) from peripheral blood leukocytes, were assayed in a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53448">methylcellulose</z:chebi> tissue culture system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three patterns of response to <z:chebi fb="32" ids="30145">lithium</z:chebi> were seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (one acquired and two Fanconi's <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>) despite increased colony-stimulating activity, CFU-C numbers remained very low and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> persisted </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An impressive therapeutic effect was seen in one patient with idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> with low colony-stimulating activity who responded to <z:chebi fb="32" ids="30145">lithium</z:chebi> with an increase in colony-stimulating activity and CFU-C resulting in persisting <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> neutrophil counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="32" ids="30145">Lithium</z:chebi> appears useful in treating a select group of neutropenic patients in whom colony-stimulating activity production is responsive to <z:chebi fb="32" ids="30145">lithium</z:chebi>, and the granulocytic progenitor compartment is capable of producing mature neutrophils </plain></SENT>
