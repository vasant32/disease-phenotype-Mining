<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They have not developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> or other hematologic manifestations of FA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There was no evidence for increased baseline or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23704">diepoxybutane</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="23704">DEB</z:chebi>)-induced chromosomal breakage in either twin when the studies were repeated in Denver as well as in New York </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Since the <z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cellular phenotype</z:mp> must be considered in establishing the diagnosis of FA, these MZ twins should not be classified as affected with FA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using the scoring system for FA diagnosis developed by Auerbach et al </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>[1989], the probability coefficients of their having FA based solely on clinical findings, prior to <z:chebi fb="3" ids="23704">DEB</z:chebi> testing, were .75 and .92, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When the combination of their anomalies are taken together, their FA probability coefficient is .98 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Through the International FA Registry, 15 additional patients have been identified with an FA probability score of .75 or greater, but who have not developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and who are <z:chebi fb="3" ids="23704">DEB</z:chebi> negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These patients, as well as the twins described in this report, are most likely a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> group and may represent other syndromes like <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0265264" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="HOS|HOS1">Holt-Oram</z:e>, VATER, VACTERL and IVIC, with genetic as well as nongenetic etiologies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These cases demonstrate the importance of testing with <z:chebi fb="3" ids="23704">DEB</z:chebi> or other DNA crosslinking agent in order to discriminate between FA and other syndromes with a similar phenotype </plain></SENT>
