<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of this study was to assess the toxicity, safety and efficacy of low-dose recombinant IL-11 in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> (BMF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with BMF due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), graft failure, chemotherapy or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) were treated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were required to have a platelet count of &lt;20 x 10(9)/l, or a platelet count of &lt;50 x 10(9)/l with an absolute neutrophil count &lt;1 x 10(9)/l, or a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> value &lt;10 g/dl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment consisted of daily IL-11 at a dose of 10 mug/kg subcutaneously followed by a 2-week rest period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two induction courses were given </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Responders could receive maintenance therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Thirty-three patients (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, n=14; AA, n=16; prolonged <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> following stem cell transplantation or chemotherapy, n=3) were evaluable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Their median age was 58 years (range 5-85) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three patients (9%) had poor risk cytogenetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Nine patients (27%) responded to IL-11 (six <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, three AA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Of these, three patients treated with IL-11 alone (n=1) or IL-11 together with other growth factors (n=2) showed multilineage recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The median time to response was 0.9 months (range 0.3-11) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Factors associated with higher response rates in univariate analysis were age &gt;50 years (P=0.008), diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> versus AA (P=0.025) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> level &gt;1 mg/dl (P=0.0004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The median response duration was 3 months (range 1.4-34.5+) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Amongst responders, the median increment in platelet count was 111 x 10(9)/l (range 43-165) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The most common side-effects were grade 1-2 lower extremity <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo>, conjunctival injections and <z:mp ids='MP_0002899'>fatigue</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Grade 3 toxicities included <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>arrhythmia</z:hpo> (n=1) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002326'>transient ischemic attack</z:hpo> (n=1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Ten patients (30%) had no side-effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Low-dose IL-11 has activity in patients with BMF and is generally well tolerated </plain></SENT>
