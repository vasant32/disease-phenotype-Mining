<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To study the clinical characteristics of <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo>-associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (HAAA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A retrospective analysis was conducted among 8 cases of established HAAA in light of the clinical and laboratory findings and the patient outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Serum samples from 8 patients with HAAA were tested for the antibodies to <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> viruses A, B, C, D, E and CMV, and 7 patients showed negative serological results while only one was positive for HBsAg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The percentage of CD4(+) cells was significantly lowered while the percentage of CD8(+) cells significantly increased to result in a lowered ratio of CD4(+)/CD8(+) cells in these HAAA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A shift in the Th1/Th2 and Tc1/Tc2 balance to a Th1 and Tc1 dominance was noted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The percentage of Treg cells was obviously decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Significant increments were found in the serum levels of interleukin-2, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="20506,26911">THF</z:chebi>-α and interferon-γ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three of the patients responded to immunosuppresssive treatment; one patient achieved a complete remission, two had a partial remission, and five failed to respond to the therapy and died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: HAAA may not have an obvious association with <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> as by <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> virus A, B, C, D, or E, and its pathogenesis often involves abnormalities of the T cell immunity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Commonly with a poor prognosis, HAAA is associated with a high mortality rate </plain></SENT>
