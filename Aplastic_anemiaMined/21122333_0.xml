<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: NKT cells in the bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNCs) from either AA patients or healthy controls were enumerated with flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>BMMNCs were cultured in RPMI1640 medium supplemented with either α-Galcer and rhIL-2 or α-Galcer, rhIL-2 and rhG-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The proliferative capacity of NKT cells was determined by NKT cell numbers before and after in vitro culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Expression of intracellular IFNγ and IL-4 in activated NKT cells was analyzed with flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In AA group, the percentage of NKT cells in BMMNCs was (0.19 ± 0.09)% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Addition of rhG-CSF into the α-Galcer/rhIL-2 culture medium resulted in significantly reduced expansion of NKT cells (67.45 ± 29.42-fold vs 79.91 ± 40.56 fold, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Meanwhile, addition of rhG-CSF reduced IFNγ positive NKT cells \[(37.45 ± 7.89)% vs (62.31 ± 14.67)%, P &lt; 0.01\] and increased IL-4 positive NKT cells \[(55.11 ± 12.13)% vs (27.03 ± 9.88)%, P &lt; 0.01\] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In healthy control group, the percentage of NKT cells in BMMNCs was (0.25 ± 0.12)% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Addition of rhG-CSF into the α-Galcer/rhIL-2 culture medium also significantly reduced expansion of NKT cells (97.91 ± 53.22-fold vs 119.58 ± 60.49-fold, P &lt; 0.05), reduced IFNγ positive NKT cells \[(28.65 ± 10.63)% vs (50.87 ± 12.66)%, P &lt; 0.01\], and increased IL-4 positive NKT cells \[(66.53 ± 14.96)% vs (31.11 ± 10.07)%, P &lt; 0.01\] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Compared to those from healthy controls, BMMNCs from AA patiants have a reduced fraction of NKT cells, which possesses a decreased potential to expand in vitro in response to α-Galcer stimulation, and produce more IFNγ(+) NKT1 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>rhG-CSF, in combination with α-Galcer, confers polarization of NKT cells towards IL-4(+) NKT2 subpopulation </plain></SENT>
