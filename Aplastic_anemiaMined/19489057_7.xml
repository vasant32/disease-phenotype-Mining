<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The determination of telomere length is useful for the characterization of <z:mp ids='MP_0009563'>dyskeratosis</z:mp> congenita (DC) and of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemias</z:hpo> (AA) as well as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Short telomeres result from a specific defect of telomere maintenance in DC and likely from higher cellular turnover in AA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Data are not conclusive for Diamond-Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi>), a pure erythroid <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> due to defects of ribosomal proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our aim was to evaluate the utility of a qPCR method for telomere length assessment to evaluate the diagnostic contribution of telomere measurement in <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> syndromes (BMFS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PROCEDURE: Telomere length was evaluated by qPCR in peripheral blood cells from 95 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals and 62 patients with BMFS, including 45 patients with <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Results obtained with qPCR are comparable with other quantitative methods, such as flow-FISH and Southern blotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our data show that only one <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> patient and a minority of other BMFS patients have very short telomeres, defined as less than the 1st percentile of controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The qPCR method for telomere length evaluation is an easy alternative to other methods and may thus be valuable in a clinical hematological laboratory setting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Telomere maintenance does not seem to be involved in the pathogenesis of <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> unlike in other BMFSs </plain></SENT>
