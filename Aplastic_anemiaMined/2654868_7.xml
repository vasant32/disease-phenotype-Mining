<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The children, the only four children less than 2 years of age who have received bone marrow transplants for these diseases at UCLA Medical Center, ranged in age from 36 weeks to 24 months at the time of transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Conditioning involved high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> treatment; three also had total body irradiation prior to bone marrow transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Their respective outcomes after follow-up times of 28 months to 71 months posttransplantation are remarkable for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> somatic growth and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> development of intelligence, language, perception, and motor coordination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that future therapeutic studies of infants and young children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> using total body irradiation, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, and bone marrow transplantation are not contraindicated by risks of debilitating neurodevelopmental sequelae </plain></SENT>
