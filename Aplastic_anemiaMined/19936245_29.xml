<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Loss-of-function mutations cause critical telomere shortening and are associated with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> syndromes <z:mp ids='MP_0009563'>dyskeratosis</z:mp> congenita and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and with idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002206'>pulmonary fibrosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Here, we sought to determine the spectrum of clinical manifestations associated with telomerase loss-of-function mutations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Sixty-nine individuals from five unrelated families with a variety of hematologic, hepatic, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disorders</z:hpo> were screened for telomerase complex gene mutations; leukocyte telomere length was measured by flow fluorescence in situ hybridization in mutation carriers and some non-carriers; the effects of the identified mutations on telomerase activity were determined; and genetic and clinical data were correlated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In six generations of a large family, a loss-of-function mutation in the telomerase enzyme gene TERT associated with severe telomere shortening and a range of hematologic manifestations, from <z:mp ids='MP_0000248'>macrocytosis</z:mp> to <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo>, with severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver diseases</z:e> marked by <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, and one case of idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002206'>pulmonary fibrosis</z:hpo> but not with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disorders</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additionally, we identified four unrelated families in which loss-of-function TERC or TERT gene mutations tracked with marrow failure, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002206'>pulmonary fibrosis</z:hpo>, and a spectrum of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These results indicate that heterozygous telomerase loss-of-function mutations associate with but are not determinant of a large spectrum of hematologic and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001392'>liver abnormalities</z:hpo>, with the latter sometimes occurring in the absence of marrow failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our findings, along with the link between <z:hpo ids='HP_0002206'>pulmonary fibrosis</z:hpo> and telomerase mutations, also suggest a common pathogenic mechanism for fibrotic diseases in which defective telomere repair plays important role </plain></SENT>
