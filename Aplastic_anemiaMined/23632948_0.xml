<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Alemtuzumab, a humanized anti-CD52, IgG1 monoclonal antibody, is used to reduce <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus- host disease</z:e> (GVHD) and aid engraftment after allogeneic haemopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Its associated low incidence of GVHD makes it an attractive alternative to anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) in transplant conditioning regimen for severe aplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> (SAA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have reviewed the use of alemtuzumab-based conditioning regimen for HSCT in SAA and show that it results in sustained haematological engraftment, a very low incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD without an increase in <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Intriguingly, alemtuzumab appears to induce tolerance post-HSCT with the findings of stable mixed T cell chimerism with full donor myeloid chimerism and the absence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD, and which persist on withdrawal of post-graft immunosuppression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Finally, its low toxicity profile may permit future application of HSCT to older patients with SAA who fail to respond to immunosuppressive therapy </plain></SENT>
