<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among the many kinds of ATG preparations, thymoglobulin had been found to be more effective for preventing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) and the rejection of organ transplants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After the promising results of our preliminary study, we conducted a phase II prospective multicenter clinical trial using a fludarabine (Flu), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (Cy), and thymoglobulin conditioning regimen to allow good engraftment in patients who underwent unrelated transplantation for SAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-eight patients underwent bone marrow (N = 15) or mobilized peripheral blood (N = 13) transplantation from HLA-matched unrelated donors with Cy (50 mg/kg once daily intravenously (i.v.) on days -9, -8, -7, and -6), Flu (30 mg/mÂ² once daily i.v. on days -5, -4, -3, and -2), and thymoglobulin (2.5 mg/kg once daily i.v. on days -3, -2, and -1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Donor-type hematologic recovery was achieved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The estimated survival rate (SR) was 67.9%, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the events were treatment-related mortality (TRM), which included <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0034155" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombotic microangiopathy</z:e> (N = 2), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> (N = 1), myocardiac infarction (N = 1), posttransplantation lymphoprolifarative disease (N = 3), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD-associated complications (N = 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The SR of patients who received bone marrow (60.0%) was not different from that of patients who received mobilized peripheral blood (76.9%) (P = .351), but the SR of patients who received more than 15 units of red blood cells before transplantation (45.5%) was significantly lower than that of the other patients (82.4%) (P = .048) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The Flu, Cy, and thymoglobulin conditioning regimen achieved promising results for successful engraftment, but the TRM was high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT00737685), and now we are performing a new multicenter study (NCT00882323) to decrease the TRM by reducing the dose of Cy </plain></SENT>
