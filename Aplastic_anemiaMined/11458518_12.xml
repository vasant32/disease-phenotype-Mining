<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The telomere length in nucleated peripheral blood (PB) cells indirectly reflects the mitotic history of their precursors: the hematopoietic stem cells (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSCs</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The average length of telomeres in PB leukocytes can be measured using fluorescence in situ hybridization and flow cytometry (flow FISH) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We previously used flow FISH to characterize the age-related turnover of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSCs</z:chebi> in healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this review, we describe results of recent flow FISH studies in patients with selected hematopoietic stem cell-associated disorders: <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>) and several <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> is characterized by a marked expansion of myeloid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0856536" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Philadelphia chromosome positive</z:e> (Ph+) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, nonmalignant (Ph-) <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSCs</z:chebi> typically coexist in the bone marrow of <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We analyzed the telomere length in &gt; 150 peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs) and bone marrow samples of patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> as well as samples of Ph- T-lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls, the overall telomere fluorescence in PBLs of patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> was significantly reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, no telomere shortening was observed in Ph- T-lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients in late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phase (CP) had significantly shorter telomeres than those assessed earlier in CP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that progressive telomere shortening is correlated with disease progression in <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Within the group of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> syndromes, we only found significantly shortened telomeres (compared to age-adjusted controls) in granulocytes from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Strikingly, the telomere length in granulocytes from AA patients who had recovered after immunosuppressive therapy (recAA) did not differ significantly from controls, whereas untreated patients and nonresponders with persistent severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> (sAANR) showed marked and significant telomere shortening compared to healthy donors and patients with recAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, an inverse correlation between age-adjusted telomere length and peripheral blood counts was found in support of a model in which the degree of cytopenia and the amount of telomere shortening are correlated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These results support the concept of extensive proliferation of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSCs</z:chebi> in subgroups of AA patients and suggest a potential use of telomere-length measurements as a prognostic tool in this group of disorders as well </plain></SENT>
