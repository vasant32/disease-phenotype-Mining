<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Although systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0100495'>mastocytosis</z:hpo> (SM) is a well-defined hematologic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasm</z:hpo>, it is sometimes difficult to discriminate between SM and a reactive mast cell (MC) <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We describe a patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> who was treated with recombinant stem cell factor (SCF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In response to SCF, the patient showed transient hematologic improvement and developed a marked increase in MC as well as a transient increase in serum tryptase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Histologic and immunohistochemical examination revealed a huge increase in MC in the bone marrow with focal infiltrates similar to SM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, most of the SM-criteria were not met: First, MC showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cytomorphological characteristics without significant atypias (no cytoplasmic extensions, no oval nuclei, no hypogranulated cytoplasm) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, bone marrow MC were CD2- and CD25-negative and did not exhibit the C-KIT 2468 A--&gt;T mutation (Asp-816-Val) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After discontinuation of SCF the MC <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> resolved confirming its reactive nature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Based on our case and similar cases mimicking <z:hpo ids='HP_0100495'>mastocytosis</z:hpo>, it seems of importance to apply recently established SM criteria in order to discriminate between reactive MC <z:mpath ids='MPATH_134'>hyperplasia</z:mpath> and true <z:hpo ids='HP_0100495'>mastocytosis</z:hpo> with certainty </plain></SENT>
