<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We evaluated 24 ATG treatments which included re-treatment with ATG in patients who had not responded to the first ATG treatment or who had relapsed after the first remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The median age was 66 years, and the median follow-up period was 52 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The response and relapse rates of ATG treatment were 70.8% and 23.1%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The response rate of ATG re-treatment was 57.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall survival and event-free survival at 10 years were 66.7% and 50.7%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The shorter duration from diagnosis to ATG treatment, the higher reticulocyte count before ATG treatment, and being female independently correlated with the efficacy of ATG treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two patients developed <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 clonal abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that ATG treatment can achieve a high response rate and long-term survival among patients with adult AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, we have to pay attention to the development of the clonal diseases </plain></SENT>
