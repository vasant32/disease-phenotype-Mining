<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Prior to surgery the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001950'>respiratory alkalosis</z:hpo> was diagnosed in 60% of HMA patients (of these, 41.7% of patients had a decompensated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001948'>alkalosis</z:hpo>), in 61.7% of AIHA patients (73%), and in 69.7% of HA patients (82.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It is shown that the development in the patients of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001950'>respiratory alkalosis</z:hpo> should be regarded as a compensatory mechanisms associated with hemic <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> complicated by arterial hypoxemia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During splenectomy, there was an increase in the incidence of decompensated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001950'>respiratory alkalosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mixed respiratory and metabolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001948'>alkalosis</z:hpo> occurred in 8.3% of AIHA patients and in 19.6% of HA patients because of artificial ventilation of the lungs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two hours after operation compensated metabolic acytosis was identified in 72% of HMA patients, in 33.3% of AIHA patients, and in 33.9% of HA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twenty-four hours following operation the patients of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the groups had arterial hypoxemia and <z:mp ids='MP_0003032'>hypocapnia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In view of this fact the blood acid-base state was determined by the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001950'>respiratory alkalosis</z:hpo>: in 47.5% of patients with HMA, in 60% of patients with AIHA, and in 54% of patients with HA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the BE/pCO2 diagram demonstrated that in 2/3 of the patients with HMA and AIHA and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients with HA, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001950'>respiratory alkalosis</z:hpo> was decompensated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It was established that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0852198,C0342579" disease_type="Pathologic Function;Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">electrolyte imbalance</z:e> detected in the patients interfered with metabolic compensation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001950'>respiratory alkalosis</z:hpo>.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
