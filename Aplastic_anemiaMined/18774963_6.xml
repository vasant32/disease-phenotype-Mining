<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: ABO major compatibility is essential in transfusions of red blood cells but is not requisite in PLT transfusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In adults there is some evidence that transfusion efficacy of ABO blood group-identical platelets (PLTs) is superior to major-mismatched PLTs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, in children this question has not been investigated for more than 30 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: In a prospective study, the efficacy (based on the 1-hour percentage of PLT recovery [PPR(1hr)]) of 400 eligible ABO blood group-identical or out-of-group apheresis PLT concentrates (APCs), transfused mainly prophylactically to 50 children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary objective was to compare PPR(1hr) between ABO-identical and major-mismatched transfusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: After ABO major-mismatched transfusions, PPR(1hr) was significantly lower than after ABO blood group-identical transfusions (median 21% vs. 32%; p = 0.034) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed major-mismatched transfusions to be significantly more often unsuccessful than identical transfusions (odds ratio [OR], 3.97; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.52-10.39; p = 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Using flow cytometry and fluorescent microscopy, it could be demonstrated that PLTs of subgroup A(1), significantly expressing A antigen on their surface, were rapidly cleared from the circulation of group O or B recipients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In contrast, major-mismatched transfusions of A(2) PLTs, expressing no detectable A antigen, were as successful as identical transfusions (OR, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.16-7.88; p = 0.90) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: These data clearly indicate that in children ABO major-mismatched PLT transfusions result in inferior transfusion efficacy, with the only exception of group A(2) PLTs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>ABO minor-mismatched PLTs showed comparable efficacy to identical transfusions </plain></SENT>
