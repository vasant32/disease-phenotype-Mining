<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Preliminary reports have suggested that survivors of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278704" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood cancer</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> who are infected with the <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> C virus (HCV) have a low risk for progression to significant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among our surviving patients who were transfused between 1961 and March 1992, 77 (6.6% of surviving patients tested thus far) have evidence of HCV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, whereas 4 surviving patients who were transfused after March 1992 are HCV-infected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One patient chronically infected with HCV died of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001399'>liver failure</z:hpo>, and 2 patients died of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001402'>hepatocellular carcinoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To characterize the risk for these and other complications, 65 patients are enrolled in a longitudinal study of HCV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, of whom 58 (89.2%) had circulating HCV <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> at the time of protocol enrollment, with genotypes 1A and 1B most commonly isolated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most enrolled patients have few or no symptoms, carry out <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> activities, and have <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> liver function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>To date, 35 patients have undergone liver biopsy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002910'>abnormal liver function</z:hpo> since the diagnosis of primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e>; central pathology review shows 28 (80%) have <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> active <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo>, 25 (71%) have <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp>, and 3 (9%) have <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These preliminary data suggest that though most survivors of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0278704" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">childhood cancer</z:e> who are infected with HCV are clinically well, some are at risk for clinically significant <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Identification of other HCV-infected patients and prospective monitoring of this cohort are ongoing to determine the risk for, and to identify factors associated with the progression of, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
