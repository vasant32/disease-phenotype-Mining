<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To explore the effect of Fuzhengyangying granules (FZYYG) on the expression of the bone marrow proliferation and bcl-2 in mice with immune mediated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty BALB/c mice were randomly allocated to 4 groups: a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control group, a model group, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> A (CSA) group and FZYYG group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The model group was fed with physical salt, while the CSA and FZYYG group were fed with CSA and FZYYG respectively, and then the changes of peripheral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (Hb), platelet, bone marrow nucleus cell (BMNC), bone marrow hematopoiesis tissue volume and bcl-2 expression were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The count of Hb, the platelet, BMNC, the bone marrow hematopoiesis tissue volume and the bcl-2 positive rate in the model group were lower than those in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> group (P&lt;0.05), whereas the count of Hb, the platelet, BMNC, the bone marrow hematopoiesis tissue volume and the bcl-2 positive rate in both CAS and FZYYG groups were significantly higher than those in the model group (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: FZYYG can induce the bcl-2 antigen expression and postpone the haematogenous cells <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, and it is effective for mice with immune mediated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
