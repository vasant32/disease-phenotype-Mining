<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We measured the endogenous plasma concentration of TPO in 40 patients with acquired aplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> (AA) and in 32 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001973'>idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi>) by a sensitive Sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and compared the results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Plasma TPO concentrations were significantly higher in AA patients (774 +/- 393 pg/ ml) in comparison with healthy control subjects (55 +/- 34 pg/ml, P &lt; 0.001), and there was a significant negative correlation between their plasma TPO concentrations and platelet counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi>, however, the TPO levels were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or only slightly elevated (73 +/- 36 pg/ml), and there was no significant difference compared with healthy controls (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was also no relationship between their plasma TPO levels and platelet counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: TPO levels may be regulated not only by platelets but also by megakaryocytes in AA and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi>, and measurement of TPO levels is useful for diagnosing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> and understanding the pathophysiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
