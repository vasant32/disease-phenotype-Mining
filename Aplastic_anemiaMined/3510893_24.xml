<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At 1 1/2-9 years after treatment, 13 patients (46%) survive in the transplant group and 45 patients (75%) survive in the second group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> except one in the second group have self-sustaining hematopoiesis without need for transfusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There is one major difference between the two therapies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Marrow transplantation restores bone marrow function completely and no late hematologic complications have been seen in this group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The majority of patients treated with antilymphocyte globulin in contrast have residual abnormalities of hematopoiesis: <z:mp ids='MP_0000248'>macrocytosis</z:mp>, mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001913'>granulocytopenia</z:hpo>, and mild <z:mp ids='MP_0003179'>thrombopenia</z:mp> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These late disorders are of concern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Despite this, we conclude that antilymphocyte globulin treatment is an effective therapy with low early mortality and morbidity and a high chance for a long, sustained remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Results are better or at least equivalent to bone marrow transplantation and patients with donors should be given the option of transplant or antilymphocyte globulin </plain></SENT>
