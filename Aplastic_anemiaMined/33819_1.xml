<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>C3H/He (H-2k, Mlsc) received 600 rad whole body x-irradiation followed by the transplantation of 10(7) lymph node cells prepared from B10.BR mic e (H-2k, Mlsb) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The C3H/He mice developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> and marrow <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> 21 days after these treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The total number of nucleated cells, CFU-S and CFU-C in the marrow and the wet weight and CFU-C of the spleen were markedly reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings are consistent with those of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> in man and the model may provide a useful tool for the investigation of the pathogenesis of this <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Control mice that received irradiation only recovered from the damage 21 days later, while control mice that receive lymph node cells only showed no hematological changes </plain></SENT>
