<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To determine the proliferative activity of the hematopoietic cells under nonneoplastic and/or neoplastic conditions, the expression of a cell cycle-related antigen, the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), was examined in the bone marrow trephines of 79 individuals, 12 of whom had no <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521860" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic disorder</z:e>, 32 of whom had a diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (MDSs), 20 of whom suffered from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, and 15 of whom had a diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most of the patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> had more than 15% PCNA-positive cells (23.5% +/- 1.5%) while patients with no <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521860" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic disorder</z:e> showed fewer than 15% PCNA-positive cells (11.7% +/- 0.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The overall ratio of the PCNA-positive cell fraction in the bone marrow was considered of prognostic value for predicting transition into overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>Aplastic anemia</z:hpo> cases usually exhibited <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151773" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypocellular bone marrow</z:e> and an infrequent labeling with the anti-PCNA antibody (3.3% +/- 0.5%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, a few <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> cases showed hypercellular bone marrow and a significantly high PCNA-positive cell ratio (32.0% +/- 4.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the bone marrow of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> patients more than 20% of total nucleated cells were positive for PCNA (30.0% +/- 2.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that the expression of PCNA is associated with the regulation of bone marrow cell proliferation and the bone marrow cellularity, and that these findings would serve as an early indicator of evolution of overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and also would be useful in distinguishing <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> cases when the bone marrow is hypocellular or normocellular </plain></SENT>
