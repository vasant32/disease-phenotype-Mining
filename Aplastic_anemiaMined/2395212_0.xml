<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patient was prepared with conventional dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, and thoracoabdominal irradiation </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Engraftment was prompt, and grade I of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD developed, which resolved with increased dose of PSL </plain></SENT>
