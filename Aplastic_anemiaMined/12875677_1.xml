<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the efficacy of allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) in the treatment of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (SAA) and severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: A patient with SAA and pseudomonas aeruginosa <z:mpath ids='MPATH_681'>septicemia</z:mpath> was treated with PBSCT from an HLA-identical sibling with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (CY) and total body irradiation (TBI) for conditioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patient was infused with 20.3 x 10(8)/kg mononuclear cells including 61.0 x 10(6)/kg CD34(+) cells following the conditioning regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Twelve days after PBSCT, the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of 1.0 x 10(9)/L was achieved, with platelet count &gt; 50 x 10(9)/L at twenty days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The donor origin of engraftment was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of short tandem repeats at the end of the first, sixth and twelfth month </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patient's body temperature dropped to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> level when her ANC reached 0.5 x 10(9)/L on day 10, and the <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp> culture of blood sample became negative subsequently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Symptoms and signs of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft versus host disease</z:e> (GVHD) were not observed in 30 months after PBSCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Hematopoiesis was reconstituted shortly after PBSCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The combination of CY and TBI and the infusion of sufficient peripheral blood stem cells may contribute to the successful engraftment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>PBSCT may be considered as the first choice when hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is needed for SAA patients complicated with severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
