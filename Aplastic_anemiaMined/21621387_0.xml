<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Whether a specific nutritional support promotes healing of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) patients is still unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we explored the potential of a high-nucleotide, arginine, and micronutrient <z:chebi fb="10" ids="50733">nutritional supplement</z:chebi> on the nutritional rehabilitation of AA mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The BALB/c AA mice model was treated with hypodermic injections of acetylphenylhydrazine (100 mg/kg), x-ray (2.0 Gy), and intraperitoneal injections of a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (80 mg/kg) combination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Then AA mice were fed with <z:chebi fb="10" ids="50733">nutritional supplements</z:chebi> in a dose-dependent manner (1445.55, 963.7, 674.59 mg/kg/d) for 7 wk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At the end of the experimental period, mice were autopsied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A full blood count was performed, and femoral marrow cell suspensions were prepared to assess the total femoral nucleated cell count and the number of committed hemopoietic progenitor cells (colony-forming units) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The pathologic changes of liver and spleen were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The significant increases of nutrient mixture groups were evident in many peripheral blood parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The femoral nucleated cell count and colony-forming units of <z:chebi fb="10" ids="50733">nutritional supplements</z:chebi> groups were markedly increased, compared with the AA group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Transmission electron microscopy showed that the number of mitochondria in similar bone marrow cells was increased in <z:chebi fb="10" ids="50733">nutritional supplements</z:chebi> groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The <z:chebi fb="10" ids="50733">nutritional supplements</z:chebi> also affected the recovery of livers and spleens of AA mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Specific <z:chebi fb="10" ids="50733">nutritional supplements</z:chebi> accelerated rehabilitation of AA mice and can be used as nutritional support in the treatment of AA </plain></SENT>
