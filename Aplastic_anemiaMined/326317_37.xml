<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 5 recipients with antibodies prior to transplantation to antigens of the ABH system present on the cells of their donors, plasma exchange and antibody absorption in vivo were effective in permitting engraftment of ABO-incompatible bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that the ABO system is not a clinically significant barrier to successful bone marrow transplantation in otherwise histocompatible individuals </plain></SENT>
