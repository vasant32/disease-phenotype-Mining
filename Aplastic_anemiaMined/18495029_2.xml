<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>INTRODUCTION: Nitrofurantoin is a commonly used drug in the treatment and prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000010'>urinary tract infections</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Many adverse effects of nitrofurantoin have been documented, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032541" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">polyneuritis</z:e>, and liver and pulmonary toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CASE PRESENTATION: We describe the clinical history and the autopsy findings in a 51-year-old woman with <z:mp ids='MP_0006050'>lung fibrosis</z:mp> of unknown etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>She had a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000010'>recurrent urinary tract infections</z:hpo>, treated with nitrofurantoin for many years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>She was referred to our hospital for screening for lung transplantation because of severe pulmonary restriction and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002094'>dyspnea</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, she died as a result of progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>respiratory insufficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At autopsy bilateral patchy, sharply circumscribed fibrotic areas in the upper and lower lobes of the lungs were seen with honeycombing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Microscopically, end-stage interstitial <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1262020" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">diffuse alveolar damage</z:e> was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Due to the atypical distribution of the <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> involving both the lower and upper lobes of the lung, the microscopic pattern of the <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> and the history of long-term nitrofurantoin use, we concluded that this drug induced the <z:mp ids='MP_0006050'>lung fibrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0000010'>recurrent urinary tract infections</z:hpo> were probably caused by a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_68'>diverticulum</z:mpath> of the urinary bladder, which was discovered at autopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This case shows that the use of nitrofurantoin may cause severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024115" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients with long-term use of nitrofurantoin should be monitored regularly for adverse pulmonary effects </plain></SENT>
