<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to detect the presence of parvovirus B19 DNA and Mycobacterium <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041296" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="tb|tbc">tuberculosis</z:e> (MTB) DNA by nested polymerase chain reaction (N-PCR) assays in the bone marrow biopsy samples from 30 patients with idiopathic AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serologic assays for parvovirus B19 were based on indirect antibody capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that neither parvovirus B19 DNA nor MTB DNA could be demonstrated in any of the bone marrow samples by N-PCR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Moreover, IgM antibody against parvovirus B19 also was undetectable in the serum samples of 17 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, our results suggest that parvovirus B19 and MTB are not associated with AA and, consequently, do not have a role in the pathogenesis of this disease </plain></SENT>
