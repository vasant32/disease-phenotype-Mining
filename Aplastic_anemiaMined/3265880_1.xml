<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two main issues are discussed: enhancement of colony growth by manipulation of accessory cells, or by the addition of patients' plasma, and the role of suppressor T cells in the pathogenesis of the disease and response to antilymphocyte globulin (ALG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A complex network of interactions exists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The identification of cells and soluble factors capable of enhancing or suppressing colony formation promises to help us better understand the events leading first to the development of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> and then eventually to hematologic recovery </plain></SENT>
