<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We describe a patient with typical <z:mpath ids='MPATH_654'>hemophagocytic syndrome</z:mpath> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="32413">HPS</z:chebi>) in whom <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> was refractory to steroid pulse therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>He was successfully treated with immunosuppressive therapy using antithymocyte globulin (ATG) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> (CyA), which is known to be effective for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Activation of histiocytes occurs in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32413">HPS</z:chebi> as a response to several cytokines produced by activated T lymphocytes, while <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of hematopoietic stem cells in AA is caused by T lymphocyte-derived cytokines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The response of this patient indicated that both diseases may have some similar immune-mediated conditions involving the activation of T lymphocytes and that intensive immunosuppressive therapy with ATG and CyA might be a useful strategy for steroid-resistant <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32413">HPS</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
