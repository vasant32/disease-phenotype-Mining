<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was purposed to establish an experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> mouse model so as to provide a basis for pathogenesis and intervention study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A classic caecal ligation and puncture (CLP) was used to establish experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>ELISA was used to detect levels of C5a, IL-6, TNFalpha, and IFN-gamma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Flow Cytometry was applied to measure <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of lymphocytes in thymus and mesentery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The pathologic changes of thymus and spleen were confirmed by HE staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results showed that almost 70%-80% mice died at 72 hours after CLP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Only approximate 20% animal survived during finite time, mice in CLP group had significant weight lose </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that a mouse model of experimental <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> was successfully established by caecal ligation and puncture which can well mimic the clinical symptom of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
