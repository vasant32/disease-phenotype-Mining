<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is a cytokine used in the treatment of serious conditions resulting from chemotherapy and bone marrow transplantation such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite these effects, GM-CSF has a very short biological half-life, and it requires frequent injection during the treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the cytokine production is possible in the body with plasmid-encoded GM-CSF (pGM-CSF) coding for cytokine administered to the body </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, the selection of the proper delivery system for the plasmid is important </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study, two different delivery systems, encapsulated plasmid such as fucoidan-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16261">chitosan</z:chebi> (fucosphere) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16261">chitosan</z:chebi> microspheres, were prepared and the particle physicochemical properties evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fucospheres and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16261">chitosan</z:chebi> microspheres size ranges are 151-401 and 376-681 nm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The zeta potential values of the microspheres were changed between 8.3-17.1 mV (fucosphere) and +21.9-28.9 mV (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16261">chitosan</z:chebi> microspheres) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The encapsulation capacity of fucospheres changed between 84.2% and 94.7% depending on the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16261">chitosan</z:chebi> molecular weight used in the formulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In vitro plasmid DNA release from both delivery systems exhibited slower profiles of approximately 90-140 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Integrity of released samples was checked by <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2511">agarose</z:chebi> gel electrophoresis, and any additional band was not seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> formulations were analyzed kinetically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The calculated regression coefficients showed a higher r2 value with zero-order kinetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the characterizations of the microspheres can be modulated by changing the formulation variables, and it can be concluded that fucospheres might be a potential carrier system for the controlled delivery of GM-CSF encoding plasmid DNA </plain></SENT>
