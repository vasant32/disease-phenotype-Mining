<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: To elucidate the pathogenesis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085077" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sweet syndrome</z:e>, one patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENT AND METHODS: A 15-year-old girl presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001954'>intermittent fever</z:hpo> and progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0000980'>pallor</z:hpo> for 3 months after non-A, non-B, non-C <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>Aplastic anemia</z:hpo> was diagnosed and therapy was begun with recombinant granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi> pulse therapy, antilymphocyte globulin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was only an increase in the neutrophil counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We continued G-CSF therapy of 300 micrograms/m2 on alternate days for 7 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At this time the white blood cell count was 10,000/microliters and the patient developed high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> and a painful, erythematous, tender plaque (3 X 3 cm) on the left thigh </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We diagnosed the lesion as a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0037278" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">skin infection</z:e> and stopped G-CSF therapy and started antibiotics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cultures were negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The lesion slowly resolved, G-CSF was restarted after 2 months, and 1 month later disseminated lesions occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Antibiotic therapy was not effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Biopsy of the lesion demonstrated infiltration of the dermis by sheets of neutrophils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We stopped G-CSF and began <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0001212'>skin lesions</z:mp> resolved rapidly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We postulated that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085077" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Sweet syndrome</z:e> was induced by G-CSF treatment </plain></SENT>
