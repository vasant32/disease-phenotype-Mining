<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have studied stromal cell function in naive or interleukin-1 (IL-1)-stimulated (100 pg/ml) long-term marrow cultures (LTC) from 12 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> donors and 21 patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Conditioned media (CM) from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> LTC contained levels of erythroid burst-promoting activity (BPA) and granulocyte/macrophage (GM) colony-stimulating activity (CSA) comparable to those previously described (Migliaccio et al., [1990] Blood, 75:305-312) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The addition of IL-1 to these cultures increased the level of CSA and, specifically, of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) released </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Anti-GM-CSF antibody neutralized BPA and CSA in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> naive LTC CM but only the CSA in the CM from IL-1-stimulated LTC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Since the concentrations of GM-CSF, as detected with a specific immunoassay, did not increase after IL-1 treatment, these data suggest that IL-1-stimulated cultures contain an unidentified growth factor having BPA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CM from AA stromal cells contained levels of CSA comparable to those observed in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> stromal cell CM but had significantly lower levels of BPA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neither anti-GM-CSF nor anti-IL-3 antibodies neutralized the BPA in AA stromal cell CM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This activity may be related to that found in the CM of IL-1-treated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> stromal cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In nearly 50% of stromal cell cultures of AA patients, addition of IL-1 failed to increase the BPA, CSA, or G-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The presence of an inhibitor in naive or IL-1-treated AA stromal cell CM was excluded by adding the CM to IL-3-stimulated cultures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that G-CSF and GM-CSF genes are differentially regulated in the marrow microenvironment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, a marrow microenvironment, deficient in BPA production and, in some cases, unresponsive to IL-1 could contribute to marrow failure in some patients with AA </plain></SENT>
