<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hematologic parameters normalized spontaneously 94 days after <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, the ability of the patient's bone marrow cells to form granulocytic-macrophagic colony-forming units (CFU-GM) or erythroid burst-forming units (BFU-E) was depressed until the 288th day, in spite of the normalization of blood counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Incubation of the patient's bone marrow cells with antilymphocytic globulin prior to the culture experiment normalized the number of CFU-GM and BFU-E in correlated studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Coculture of a target marrow with several concentrations of the patient's lymphocytes or serum resulted in a complete inhibition of CFU-GM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>BFU-E growth was inhibited by the patient's lymphocytes, but not by serum, which rather showed burst-promoting activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The inhibitory effect on target bone marrow persisted for 288 days, when it disappeared concomitantly with the restoration of spontaneous CFU-GM and BFU-E growth </plain></SENT>
