<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We reviewed clinical and laboratory data of patients diagnosed with transfusion-independent non-severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (NSAA) from 1996 to 2009 at the Institute of Hematology and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Blood Diseases</z:e> Hospital, Peking Union Medical College, and analyzed the clinical course and outcomes in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>NSAA was defined as bone marrow cellularity &lt;50 % and two or three cytopenias that persisted for 6 weeks or more: absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &lt;1.5 × 10(9)/L, absolute reticulocyte count (ARC) &lt;40 × 10(9)/L, platelet count &lt;100 × 10(9)/L, without meeting criteria for SAA (bone marrow cellularity &lt;30 % and two or three cytopenias: ANC &lt;0.5 × 10(9)/L, ARC &lt;20 × 10(9)/L, platelet count &lt;20 × 10(9)/L) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were treated with reasonable supportive care, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> A, and stanozolol (0.1 mg/kg/day) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of a total of 284 patients, 117 (41.2 %) were female, and 167 (58.8 %) were male </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up of 43 months (range 2-196 months), 38 patients (13.4 %) progressed to transfusion-dependent NSAA and among them 26 patients (9.2 %) progressed to SAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One hundred and ninety-eight patients (69.7 %) had persistent NSAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Forty-eight patients (16.9 %) showed the complete resolution of NSAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The Kaplan-Meier estimates of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients for progression-free survival were 86 ± 2.7 % and 66 ± 7.3 % at 60 and 120 months after diagnosis, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients with ANC &lt;1.0 × 10(9)/L or female had a higher probability of progression to transfusion-dependent NSAA (18.5 vs. 5.4 %, respectively; p = 0.002, and 17.1 vs. 10.8 %, respectively; p = 0.022) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The patients with ARC &lt;60 × 10(9)/L or with ANC &lt;1.0 × 10(9)/L had a higher probability of progression to SAA (11.5 vs. 3.6 %, respectively; p = 0.035, and 12.7 vs. 3.6 %, respectively; p = 0.011) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A categorical risk factor analysis showed that patients with ANC &lt;1 × 10(9)/L had a higher probability of progression to SAA (p = 0.03) and had a higher probability of progression to transfusion-dependent AA (p = 0.007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>NSAA patients may be benefited from early intervention with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> A and stanozolol </plain></SENT>
