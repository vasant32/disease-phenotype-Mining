<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results showed that 3 months after treatment, the elevation of CFU-GM in the two groups were similar to each other, but after 6 months' treatment, level of CFU-GM in treated group elevated persistently and steadily, while in control group, it decreased slightly as compared with level at 3 months' treatment, suggesting the recovery of bone marrow hematopoiesis of treated group was more stable than that of control group </plain></SENT>
