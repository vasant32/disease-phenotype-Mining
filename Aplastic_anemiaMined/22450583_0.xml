<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>She had a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> phenotype in her red blood cells (RBC) and granulocytes, and HLA DR15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Her <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> was deteriorated from stage 2 to stage 3, and she required periodic RBC transfusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four months after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> therapy, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> improved and she did not need RBC transfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, three months thereafter, she again required RBC transfusions after developing severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6775">mesalazine</z:chebi> and steroid pulse therapy improved her <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo>, her transfusion dependency persisted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eleven months after the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, equine anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> were administered, but no hematological improvement was obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Six months after the administration of ATG and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi>, transformation to refractory cytopenia with multilineage <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RCMD</z:e>) with 7-<z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An allogeneic bone marrow transplant (BMT) from a HLA-identical sibling was performed 23 months after the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Complete remission of both the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> was obtained without medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Although the relationship between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> remains unclear, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002715'>immunological abnormalities</z:hpo> might be involved in the pathogenesis of both disorders because she had <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> phenotype in RBC and HLA DR15 and because allogeneic BMT improved both disorders </plain></SENT>
