<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of our work was to evaluate platelet kinetics in LC with different etiologies by examining platelet production and destruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Ninety-one consecutive LC patients (36 HCV, 49 alcoholics, 15 HBV) were enrolled </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As controls, 25 subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001973'>idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura</z:hpo>, 10 subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, and 40 healthy blood donors were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Plasma thrombopoietin (TPO) was measured by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Reticulated platelets (RP) were determined using the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52293">Thiazole Orange</z:chebi> method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Plasma glycocalicin (GC) was measured using monoclonal antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Platelet associated and serum antiplatelet antibodies were detected by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>B-cell monoclonality in PBMC was assessed by immunoglobulin fingerprinting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Serum TPO was significantly lower in LC (29.9±18.1 pg/ml) compared to controls (82.3±47.6 pg/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The GC levels were higher in LC (any etiology) than in healthy cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Conversely, the absolute levels of RP were lower in LC (any etiology) than in healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The platelet-associated and serum anti-<z:hpo ids='HP_0003454'>platelet antibodies</z:hpo> were higher in HCV+ LC compared to healthy subjects (p&lt;0.0064), alcoholic LC (p&lt;0.018), and HBV+ LC (p&lt;0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>B-cell monoclonality was found in 27% of the HCV+LC, while it was not found in HBV+ or alcoholic LC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Patients with LC present decreased plasma TPO, accelerated platelet turnover, and reduced platelet production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>This indicates that LC <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> is a multifactorial condition involving both increased platelet clearance and impaired thrombopoiesis </plain></SENT>
