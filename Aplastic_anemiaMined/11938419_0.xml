<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with underlying hematologic and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021053" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">immunologic disorders</z:e> who become infected with this virus are at risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This small study attempts to confirm this relation between the human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085273" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">parvovirus B19 infection</z:e> as one of the predisposing factor of aplastic crisis in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1263988" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemolytic disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The laboratory records of 73 patients' serum samples, which were tested for detection of specific Immunoglobulin M and Immunoglobulin G antibody by means of the recurrently available indirect enzyme linked Immunoassay during the period from March 1998 to March 2001, were reviewed retrospectively at the Armed Forces Hospital, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: For <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients there were 11 (15%) who were diagnosed as <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> while 50 (68%) had serological evidence of previous exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eight out of the 11 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> patients had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1263988" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemolytic disorder</z:e> as the underlying disease while, the 3 other patients were organ transplant and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disease</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Seventy-eight percent of our infected patients were known to have an underlying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">blood disorder</z:e>, while 22% had immunosuppressed disorders such as organ transplant and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009782" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">connective tissue disorder</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Parvovirus B19 can be considered as one of the predisposing factors of hemolytic crisis in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1263988" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemolytic disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
