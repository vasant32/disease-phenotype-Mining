<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Therapy was discontinued in only 4 patients (10.8%) due to severe adverse effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Adverse effects occurred more frequently with ATG (rabbit-derived) than with ALG (horse-derived) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seven patients underwent 2 or 3 cycles of ATG/ALG therapy, for a combined total of 8 times; 6 of those patients (75% (6/8)) experienced adverse effects </plain></SENT>
