<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To estimate the cellular immune response of workers highly exposed to mixtures of organic solvents, subpopulations of peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For this, the PBLs of nine floorers (aged 25-58 years, exposure time 8-35 years) were subsequently labelled with monoclonal antibodies OKT4, OKT8, OKT11, anti-Leu 7 and anti-Leu 12 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Analysis was made by a FACS IV cell sorter (Becton-Dickinson, USA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The control group consisted of matched pairs of healthy donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the exposed group we found a decrease in the OKT11 (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>) T cell fraction, a decrease in the OKT4 helper cells, an increase in the anti-Leu 7 positive cells, mostly natural killer cells, an important increase in anti-Leu 12 labelled T cells, i.e., human B-lymphocytes, and no differences in the OKT8 suppressor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Total fluorescence intensity profiles between the exposed and the unexposed group did not differ, i.e., the marker density on the cell surfaces remained unchanged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Similar changes in lymphocyte subpopulations are found in states of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> and immunogenetic forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, a disease whose etiological relationship may be due to long-term exposure to organic solvents </plain></SENT>
