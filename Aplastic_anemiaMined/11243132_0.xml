<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Serum G-CSF level was detected by ELISA assay in 36 SAA-I patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Pre-treatment serum G-CSF levels of 27/36 (75%) SAA-I patients were above <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These patients achieved better curative outcomes in a shorter period of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Detection of serum G-CSF level in SAA-I patients is helpful for judging the clinical status and prognosis </plain></SENT>
