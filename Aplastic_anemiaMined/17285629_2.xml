<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> is an acquired hematopoietic stem cell disorder leading to a partial or absolute deficiency of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> glycophosphatidyl-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="24848">inositol</z:chebi> (GPI)-linked proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The classical approach to diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> by cytometry involves the loss of at least two GPI-linked antigens on RBCs and neutrophils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>While flow assays are more sensitive and specific than complement-mediated lysis or the Hams test, they suffer from several drawbacks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>Bacterial</z:mp> aerolysin binds to the GPI moiety of cell surface GPI-linked molecules and causes lysis of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> but not GPI-deficient <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>FLAER is an Alexa488-labeled inactive variant of aerolysin that does not cause lysis of cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our goals were to develop a FLAER-based assay to diagnose and monitor patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> and to improve detection of minor populations of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> clones in other <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521860" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In a single tube assay, we combined FLAER with CD45, CD33, and CD14 allowing the simultaneous analysis of FLAER and the GPI-linked CD14 structure on neutrophil and monocyte lineages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Comparison to standard CD55 and CD59 analysis showed excellent agreement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Because of the higher signal to noise ratio, the method shows increased sensitivity in our hands over single (CD55 or CD59) parameter analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Using this assay, we were able to detect as few as 1% <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> monocytes and neutrophils in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, that were otherwise undetectable using CD55 and CD59 on RBC's </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We also observed abnormal FLAER staining of blast populations in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In these cases, the neutrophils stained normally with FLAER, while the gated CD33bright cells failed to express <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels of CD14 and additionally showed aberrant CD45 staining and bound lower levels of FLAER </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: FLAER combined with multiparameter flow cytometry offers an improved assay for diagnosis and monitoring of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> clones and may have utility in detection of unsuspected <z:hpo ids='HP_0005547'>myeloproliferative disorders</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
