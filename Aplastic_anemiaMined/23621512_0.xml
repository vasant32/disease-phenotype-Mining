<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report two novel mutations found on the promoter of the Aγ gene and summarize <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> common and rare determinants associated with hereditary persistence of fetal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HPFH</z:e>) described thus far </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Hematological and molecular analysis of the Aγ <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5386">globin</z:chebi> gene in two cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HPFH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Comparison of the novel cases with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> those described in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We have found two novel mutations in three Italian patients with HbF values between 5.9% and 6.5% without an elevated HbA2 and with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> parameters </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In two probands (mother and son), a -197 C&gt;T transition was observed, while in a single individual, a -113 A&gt;G transition was present on the distal CCAAT box of the Aγ gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As no other abnormalities were present in both γ-gene promoters and the changes are located on regulatory sequences, we may conclude that these mutations are responsible for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HPFH</z:e> phenotype shown by the carriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The laboratory should be able to discriminate between elevated HbF due to artifacts or to serious causes including bone marrow <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, and β-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002875" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thalassemia major</z:e> or recessive traits such as β-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085578,C0472766" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thalassemia minor</z:e>, δβ-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039730" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thalassemia</z:e>, or nonpathological conditions induced by mutations or polymorphisms of the γ-gene promoters that may even be beneficial when present in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002875" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thalassemia major</z:e> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sickle cell disease</z:e> and, in particular, when these patients are treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44423">hydroxyurea</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
