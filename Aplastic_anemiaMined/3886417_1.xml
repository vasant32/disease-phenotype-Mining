<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These patients were compared with an historic group of 25 similar patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> or AA given <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> (MTX) for GvHD prophylaxis at this institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Engraftment was faster in patients given CyA when compared with MTX patients, with less days of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001913'>granulocytopenia</z:hpo> (P = 0.04), a shorter interval before reaching a platelet count of 70 X 10(9)/l (P = 0.04), fewer major <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> (P = 0.01), and fewer days on intravenous antibiotics (P = 0.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were no graft failures in CyA patients compared with four of 25 in MTX patients (P = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Early mortality was lower in CyA patients but not significantly (P = 0.06) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The incidence of pulmonary complications was comparable, five of 29 and seven of 25 in CyA and MTX patients, respectively, but the clinical features of such complications differed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Interstitial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> developing after day 30 was seen in MTX patients, whereas an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0002098'>respiratory distress</z:hpo> syndrome developing between day +8 and day +18 was seen in CyA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> GvHD was less severe in CyA patients (P = 0.04), but <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GvHD was comparable (P = 0.3) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Although our initial experience with CyA is encouraging with regard to engraftment and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GvHD, optimization of CyA protocols will probably be needed for it to be proven as having a definite advantage over MTX </plain></SENT>
