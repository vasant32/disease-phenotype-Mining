<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The case of a 9-month-old who underwent LDLT with her 23-year-old HLA-homozygous mother as a donor demonstrates the consequences of this occurrence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient developed GVHD with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>; the patient's nucleated peripheral blood elements were shown to be entirely derived from the donor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Later, after some marrow recovery, the patient's circulating lymphocytes had a donor origin, while the marrow-derived neutrophils had a recipient origin </plain></SENT>
