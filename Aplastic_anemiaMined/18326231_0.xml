<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: To evaluate expression of genes participating in regulation of hemopoietic stem cells (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSC</z:chebi>) in the cells of stromal sublayer of bone marrow long-term cultures in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA); to determine effects of parathyroid hormone (PTH) on stromal microenvironment and on its ability to maintain <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSC</z:chebi> homeostasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Gene expression in the sublayer of the adherent cells (SAC) was examined with RT-PCt </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SAC was for a long time treated with PTH, then their ability to secure survival of early hemopoietic precursors was tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Changes in the function of stromal cells and expression of some genes were compared in 9 AA patients and 14 donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Stromal sublayer of AA patients is characterized by low expression of Ang-1 and VCAM-1 genes and high VEGF expression compared to mean level of healthy donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PTH stimulates expression of different genes participating in <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSC</z:chebi> regulation in stromal cells of some patients and improves survival of early hemopoietic hemopoietic precursors on such sublayers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: AA patients have severe defects in SAC interaction with stroma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In some cases the defects can be partially compensated with application of PTH </plain></SENT>
