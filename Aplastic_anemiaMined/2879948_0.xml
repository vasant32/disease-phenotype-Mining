<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The titer of anti-HTLV-I antibody was determined by indirect immunofluorescence using the MT-2 cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two of two patients with ATL were positive for antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, six of 18 cases of T-<z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp> were positive (33%), while two of 29 cases of B-<z:mp ids='MP_0005384'>cell phenotype</z:mp> were antibody-positive (7%) </plain></SENT>
