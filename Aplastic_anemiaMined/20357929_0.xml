<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Factors influencing engraftment after autologous or allogeneic HSCT were investigated in 65 patients: 25 autologous peripheral stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) and 40 allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The major factor affecting engraftment was the graft source for HSCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Neutrophil and platelet recovery were more rapid in autologous PBSCT than in allogeneic BMT [neutrophil occurring in median on day 10.00 (09.00/11.00) and 19.00 (16.00/23.00) and platelet on day 11.00 (10.00/13.00) and 21.00 (18.00/25.00), respectively; p &lt; 0.0001] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The type of disease also affected engraftment, where <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> (MM) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> showed faster engraftment when compared with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, syndrome myelodysplastic (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SMD</z:e>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) and MM presented the best overall survival (OS) in a period of 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Other factors included the drug used in the conditioning regimen (CR), where CBV, melphalan (M-200) and FluCy showed faster engraftment and M-200 presented the best OS, in a period of 12 months and age, where 50-59 years demonstrated faster engraftment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sex did not influence neutrophil and platelet recovery </plain></SENT>
