<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Although recent advances in therapy offer the promise for improving survival in patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (SAA), the small size of the patient population, lack of a mechanism in North America for longitudinal follow-up of patients, and inadequate cooperation among hematologists, scientists, and transplant physicians remain obstacles to conducting large studies that would advance the field </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To address this issue, the Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network (BMT CTN) convened a group of international experts in March 2010 to define the most important questions in the basic science, immunosuppressive therapy (IST), and bone marrow transplantation (BMT) of SAA and propose initiatives to facilitate clinical and biologic research </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Key conclusions of the working group were: (1) new patients should obtain accurate, expert diagnosis and early identification of biologic risk; (2) a population-based SAA outcomes registry should be established in North America to collect data on patients longitudinally from diagnosis through and after treatment; (3) a repository of biologic samples linked to the clinical data in the outcomes registry should be developed; (4) innovative approaches to unrelated donor BMT that decrease <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> are needed; and (5) alternative donor transplantation approaches for patients lacking HLA-matched unrelated donors must be improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A partnership of BMT, IST, and basic science researchers will develop initiatives and partner with advocacy and funding organizations to address these challenges </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Collaboration with similar study groups in Europe and Asia will be pursued </plain></SENT>
