<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The outcome of patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (SAA) has improved considerably over the last decades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) is the treatment of choice in young patients who have an HLA-identical sibling donor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study analyzes the outcome and factors related to survival in patients with SAA receiving BMT in our institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: Between March 1978 and December 1996, 49 consecutive patients received an HLA-identical sibling marrow transplant for SAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median age was 21 years (range, 4 to 47) and 15 (31%) were women </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median interval from diagnosis to transplant was 2.6 months (range, 0.5 to 159) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Between 1978 and 1982 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were conditioned with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (CY) alone and received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> (MTX) until day 102 as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GvHD) prophylaxis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>From 1983 most patients received CY and thoraco-abdominal irradiation (TAI) as the conditioning regimen and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> (CSA) as GvHD prophylaxis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Survival probability at 10 years was 55 +/- 7% with a median follow-up for the surviving patients of 8.5 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The incidences of graft failure, grade II to IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GvHD, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GvHD were 21%, 39.5% and 31%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis three factors adversely influenced survival: a) age &gt; or = 30 years (p = 0.05); b) &gt; or = 10 transfusion units pre-BMT (p = 0.008); and c) use of long course MTX for GvHD prophylaxis (p = 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>One case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002860'>squamous-cell carcinoma</z:hpo> occurred in a TAI-treated patient 13 years post-transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: BMT is effective in young patients with SAA who have an HLA-identical sibling donor, particularly if minimally transfused pre-transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The introduction of TAI and CSA to our preparative regimen has led to a remarkably increased survival </plain></SENT>
