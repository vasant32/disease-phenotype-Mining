<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 21-year-old woman with SAA of 6 years duration had been transfused heavily before transplantation and had developed refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> and secondary hematochromatosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Syngeneic PBSCT with immunosuppression using ATG, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin-A</z:chebi> was eventually performed without high-dose chemotherapy in September 1997 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The second syngeneic PBSCT with the same immunosuppression was successfully performed in a 35-year-old male patient who had had SAA for 3 months in November 1998 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Haemopoietic engraftment was rapid and sustained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> or mucositis during the syngeneic PBSCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patients are currently 9 to 22 months post-PBSCT without rejection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our experience suggests that syngeneic PBSCT with brief immunosuppression is an effective alternative to pretransplant high-dose chemotherapy conditioning for SAA patients having syngeneic transplantation </plain></SENT>
