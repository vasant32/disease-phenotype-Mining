<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we analyzed the outcome of 32 adult patients with acquired severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (SAA) who were at a high risk for graft rejection, including multiple transfusions (median 147 units, range 20-680) and long disease duration (median 67 months, range 3-347), and who had received both BM and CD34(+)-purified PBSCs from an HLA-matched sibling donor to reduce graft rejection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>T cells in PBSCs were depleted using a magnetic-activated cell sorting method (CliniMACS system) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Conditioning regimens consisted largely of CY and antithymocyte globulin (ATG) with fludarabine (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FLU</z:e>) or procarbazine (PCB) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up of 89 months, the 8-year probability of survival was 87.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Neutrophils and plts promptly recovered, and none of the patients developed graft failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cumulative incidences of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD were 9.4 and 18.0%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sustained engraftment and excellent survival without an apparent increase in the rate of GVHD in high-risk patients using the current approach showed that high-dose SCT with both BM and CD34(+)-purified PBSCs may yield better outcomes in heavily transfused and/or allo-immunized patients with SAA </plain></SENT>
