<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Case-control study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DATA SOURCE: Kaiser Permanente Colorado electronic data warehouses and electronic medical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: Cases were patients with a <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16919">creatine</z:chebi> kinase (CK) level of at least 2000 U/L or who developed a clinically significant non-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>-related <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">blood dyscrasia</z:e> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001882'>leukopenia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo>) between January 1, 2006, and June 30, 2009 (954 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Each case was matched to up to 10 controls by age, sex, and index date (date of the increased CK level or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">blood dyscrasia</z:e>-supporting laboratory value) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Controls were patients without elevated CK levels or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">blood dyscrasias</z:e> who had a routine health maintenance examination during the same time period (index date was the date of their health maintenance examination [9007 controls]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The primary study outcome was <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> exposure, defined as a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> prescription purchase in the 100Â days before the index date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The likelihood of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> exposure was examined with conditional logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cases experienced a higher rate of previous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> exposure compared with controls (0.6% vs 0.2%, odds ratio 3.9, 95% confidence interval 1.4-10.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, cases had higher hospitalization rates (14.9% vs 5.0%, p&lt;0.001), higher mean <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> disease scores (2.5 vs 0.0, p&lt;0.001), and were more likely to have been exposed to drugs that may increase the risk of adverse events due to an interaction with a CYP3A4 inhibitor drug (6.9% vs 2.3%, p&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patients with confirmed elevations in CK level and/or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">blood dyscrasias</z:e> had a higher rate of previous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> exposure, although low overall, and greater hospitalization rates and exposure to drugs that may increase the risk of adverse events compared with controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These findings support the 2009 United States Food and Drug Administration labeling for the first branded <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23359">colchicine</z:chebi> product, cautioning use in patients with liver impairment or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000082'>renal dysfunction</z:hpo> and/or those receiving concurrent drugs that may increase risk of adverse events </plain></SENT>
