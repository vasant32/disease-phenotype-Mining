<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Circulating mononuclear cells from a patient developing severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> during the course of non-A, non-B <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> were found to be virtually entirely composed of in vivo activated suppressor T cells (Ia+T8+) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These cells were used to establish a new permanent cell line, termed SMAA, by using phytohemagglutinin, Ebstein-Barr virus-transformed irradiated B cells, allogeneic irradiated peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and recombinant interleukin 2 to investigate the relationship of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>-derived circulating T cells to <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>SMAA cells, now in continuous culture for more than 9 mo, were shown to inhibit proliferation of purified myeloid progenitors and their differentiation into early and late appearing neutrophil and eosinophil colonies by 90%, whereas monocyte colonies were much less affected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Similarly, growth of erythroid colonies and bursts was almost completely inhibited, as was anti-mu-induced B cell proliferation and lectin-induced T cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This inhibition of hematopoiesis was mediated by the release of a soluble factor that was sensitive to acid (pH 2), heat (56 degrees C), and trypsin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies to interferon-gamma could abrogate the inhibitory effects of SMAA supernatant, but more than 10(4) neutralizing U/ml had to be added </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The effects of SMAA could be duplicated by adding 10(4) U/ml of purified recombinant interferon-gamma to colony and proliferation assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The concentration of interferon-gamma in SMAA supernatant was estimated to be greater than 3 X 10(3) National Institutes of Health reference U/ml by immunoradiometric assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results demonstrate that some patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> have circulating T cells that are capable of prolonged in vitro secretion of interferon-gamma causing severe inhibition of in vitro hematopoiesis, and these cells can be expanded into permanent lines for studies on their regulatory properties </plain></SENT>
