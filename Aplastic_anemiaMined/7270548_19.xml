<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purification of human erythropoietin (EP) had provided small quantities of highly bioactive EP (approximately 70,000 U/mg) required for the development of an EP radioimmunoassay (RIA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The RIA for EP described in this investigation, can detect 5 mU/ml of EP in the assay tube; the serum concentration of EP in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals ranged from less than 18 to 81 mU/ml with a mean value of 29 mU/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In contrast, nine patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> had markedly elevated serum EP concentrations with a mean value of 3,487 mU/ml, range 984--6,434 mU/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this RIA, patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001901'>Polycythemia</z:hpo> vera had consistently undetectable EP concentrations, less than 18 mU/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0003774'>chronic renal failure</z:hpo> had a higher mean serum EP concentration (40.5 mU/ml) than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals, but the range (less than 18-115 mU/ml) overlapped that of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normals</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>By immunologic and gel chromatographic criteria, EP measured in serum was similar to standard urinary EP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The EP immunoassay that we have developed has sufficient sensitivity and specificity not only to quantitate the elevated serum EP levels found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> but also to discriminate decreased from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> serum concentrations of EP in most circumstances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This simple, reliable RIA has provided the necessary framework upon which to increase our understanding of the importance of EP in hematopoiesis </plain></SENT>
