<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, the phosphoglycolate phosphatase activity was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, but the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="19324">2,3-diphosphoglycerate</z:chebi> values were nonetheless increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, no relationship was found between phosphoglycolate phosphatase activity and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="19324">2,3-diphosphoglycerate</z:chebi> levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The lack of correlation between the activity of phosphoglycolate phosphatase and 2,3-DPG levels suggests that modulation of phosphoglycolate phosphatase activity does not control the level of 2,3-DPG in erythrocytes </plain></SENT>
