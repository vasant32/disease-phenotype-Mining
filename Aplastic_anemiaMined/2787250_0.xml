<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this report, we show a simple method for the partial purification of megakaryocyte colony-stimulating factor from human urine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A four-step purification procedure, which included <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> precipitation, CM Affi-Gel Blue chromatography, wheat germ agglutinin-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="2511">Sepharose</z:chebi> chromatography and high-resolution <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52254">hydroxyapatite</z:chebi> chromatography, resulted in an about 430- to 630-fold increase of specific activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The final fractions were still contaminated with erythropoietin, but the contaminated content of erythropoietin was not enough to stimulate mouse megakaryocytopoiesis in our culture system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also demonstrate that human urinary extracts stimulated human megakaryocyte colony formation </plain></SENT>
