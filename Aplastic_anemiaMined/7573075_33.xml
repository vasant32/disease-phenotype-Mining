<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previously published data about potential worksite exposures and mortality of construction site workers are limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analyzed occupation and industry codes on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> certificates from 19 U.S. states to evaluate mortality risks among men and women usually employed in construction occupations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Proportionate mortality ratios (PMRs) for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and several other <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> diseases were significantly elevated among 61,682 white male construction workers who died between 1984 and 1986 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Men younger than age 65, who were probably still employed immediately prior to <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo>, had significantly elevated PMRs for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e>, asbestos-related diseases, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004936" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">mental disorders</z:e>, alcohol-related disease, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0012242" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">digestive diseases</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002527'>falls</z:hpo>, poisonings, traumatic fatalities that are usually work-related, and homicides </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Elevated PMRs for many of the same causes were observed to a lesser degree for black men and white women whose usual industry was construction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, women experienced excess <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> of the connective tissue and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0812393,C0038661" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction;Injury or Poisoning" abbrv="">suicide</z:e> mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Various skilled construction trades had elevated PMRs for specific sites, such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0279530" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">bone cancer</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002861'>melanoma</z:hpo> in brickmasons, <z:hpo ids='HP_0012126'>stomach cancer</z:hpo> in roofers and brickmasons, kidney and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0279530" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">bone cancer</z:e> in concrete/terrazzo finishers, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751394" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">nasal cancer</z:e> in plumbers, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0041327" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary tuberculosis</z:e> in laborers, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1370468" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">scrotal cancer</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> in electricians, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> in boilermakers, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007113" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">rectal cancer</z:e> and multiple <z:mp ids='MP_0000612'>sclerosis</z:mp> in electrical power installers, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242379" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lung cancer</z:e> in structural metal workers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Using a standard population of blue collar workers did not result in fewer elevated PMRs for construction workers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Despite lifestyle differences and other limitations of the study, the large numbers of excess <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> observed in this study indicate the need for preventive action for construction workers </plain></SENT>
