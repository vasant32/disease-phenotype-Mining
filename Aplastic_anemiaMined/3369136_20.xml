<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of these 335 patients, who had a negative antibody screening on admission and a negative transfusion history, 69 (21%) developed either transient (n = 18) or permanent (n = 51) lymphocytotoxic antibodies, but only 31 patients (9%; 95% confidence limits 6-12%) developed multispecific alloantibodies necessitating HLA-matched platelet transfusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There was no difference with regard to the development of antibodies and platelet refractoriness between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> patients receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35610">cytostatic</z:chebi> treatment and patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> and antithymocyte globulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Females with previous pregnancies developed platelet refractoriness with an increased incidence (Chi 2 13.38; p less than 0.001) compared to females without previous pregnancies, males, and children </plain></SENT>
