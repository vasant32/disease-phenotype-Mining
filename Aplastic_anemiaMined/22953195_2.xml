<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Seven cases of malignant lymphohematopoietic (LHP) disorder were claimed to have developed from occupational exposure at two plants of a semiconductor company from 2007 to 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study evaluated the possibility of exposure to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50903">carcinogenic agents</z:chebi> for the cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Clinical courses were reviewed with assessing possible exposure to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50903">carcinogenic agents</z:chebi> related to LHP <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Chemicals used at six major semiconductor companies in Korea were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Airborne monitoring for chemicals, including <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi>, was conducted and the ionizing radiation dose was measured from 2008 to 2010 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The latency of seven cases (five leukemiae, a Non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, and an <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>) ranged from 16 months to 15 years and 5 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most chemical measurements were at levels of less than 10% of the Korean Occupational Exposure Limit value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No carcinogens related to LHP <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> were used or detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Complete-shielded radiation-generating devices were used, but the ionizing radiation doses were 0.20-0.22 uSv/hr (background level: 0.21 ÂµSv/hr) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Airborne <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> was detected at 0.31 ppb when the detection limit was lowered as low as possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="46" ids="29362">Ethylene</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16842">formaldehyde</z:chebi> were not found in the cases' processes, while these two were determined to be among the 263 chemicals in the list that was used at the six semiconductor companies at levels lower than 0.1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Exposures occurring before 2002 could not be assessed because of the lack of information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Considering the possibility of exposure to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50903">carcinogenic agents</z:chebi>, we could not find any convincing evidence for occupational exposure in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> investigated cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, further study is needed because the semiconductor industry is a newly developing one </plain></SENT>
