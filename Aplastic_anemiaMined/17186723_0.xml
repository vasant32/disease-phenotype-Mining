<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Gene expressions of TCR Vbeta sub-families in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 20 AA patients were detected before and after treatment with SM using RT-PCR and gene scanning method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: TCR Vbeta gene repertoire of the 24 subfamily genes deviated in AA patients, and the oligoclonal gene expressions increased obviously compared with those in healthy people (P &lt; 0.01), including Vbeta2, 5, 6, 15, 16, 22, and 23 were found in 30%-50% AA patients, and Vbeta8, 21 were in more than 50% patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These oligoclonal genes reduced significantly after treatment with SM compared with those before treatment (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Multiple TCR Vbeta subfamilies of clonal proliferation participate in the pathogenesis of AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SM can rectify the deviation of TCR Vbeta gene repertoire, reduce the abnormal clonal proliferation of T cells, thus to alleviate the immune injury to hematopoietic tissue, and thus to benefit the recovery of hematopoiesis of bone marrow </plain></SENT>
