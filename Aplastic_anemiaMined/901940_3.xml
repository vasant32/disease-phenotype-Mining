<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Double-dominant W/Wv anemic mice were sublethally irradiated to facilitate repopulation of marrow with transplanted cells and were injected intravenously with suspensions of 5-10 million placental cells of 15 days gestation derived from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, isogeneic donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Red cell counts fell promptly after irradiation and then rose progressively over a period of weeks, reaching <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels of the nonmutant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mean corpuscular volume and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> electrophoresis patterns of red cells in recipient W/Wv mice resembled those of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> donor animals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The therapeutic effect lasted for the duration of the observation period, in some instances over 9 mo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>W/Wv mice that were administered Hanks' solution or fetal blood, instead of placental transplants, remained anemic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Late gestation placentas (18 days) were also ineffective </plain></SENT>
