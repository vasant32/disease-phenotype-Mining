<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> who have relapsed after achieving a remission of chemotherapy, marrow grafting from an identical twin or an HLA-identical sibling has now been demonstrated to produce median remissions as long as or longer than any reported for combination chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast to chemotherapy, marrow transplantation offers the possibility of cure for a small but significant fraction of these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Marrow transplantation for patients with ANL in first remission has now resulted in median survivals much longer than any reported with chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although it now appears that more than 50% of these patients can be cured with marrow transplantation, a much longer follow-up is indicated since some patients who achieve a complete remission with combination chemotherapy are now living for a long time, and some of these patients (less than 20%) may also be cured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Current intensive research with new modalities such as interferon, <z:chebi fb="4" ids="2453">Acyclovir</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">Cyclosporin A</z:chebi>, and monoclonal antibodies can reasonably be expected to improve the overall results of marrow transplantation </plain></SENT>
