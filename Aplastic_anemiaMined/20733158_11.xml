<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>T helper type 17 (Th17) cells have been characterized based on production of interleukin-17 (IL-17) and association with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied the role of Th17 cells in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) by isolating Th17 cells from patients blood (n = 41) and bone marrow (BM) mononuclear cells (n = 7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The frequency and total number of CD3(+)CD4(+)IL-17-producing T cells were increased in AA patients at presentation compared with healthy controls (P = .0007 and .02, respectively) and correlated with disease activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was an inverse relationship between the numbers of Th17 cells and CD4(+)CD25(high)FoxP3(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs) in the blood of AA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Concomitant with the classical Th1 response, we detected the presence of CD4(+) and CD8(+) IL-17-producing T cells in a mouse model of lymph node infusion-induced BM failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although anti-IL-17 treatment did not abrogate BM failure, early treatment with the anti-IL-17 antibody reduced the severity of BM failure with significantly higher platelet (P &lt; .01) and total BM cell (P &lt; .05) counts at day 10 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Recipients that received anti-IL-17 treatment had significantly fewer Th1 cells (P &lt; .01) and more Treg cells (P &lt; .05) at day 10 after lymph node infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Th17 immune responses contribute to AA pathophysiology, especially at the early stage during disease progression </plain></SENT>
