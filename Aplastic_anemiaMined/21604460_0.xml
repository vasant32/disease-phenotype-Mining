<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A prospective analysis over 2 years (01/01/07 to 31/12/08) enrolling 19 children treated with allogeneic intrafamilial bone marrow transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Indications for bone marrow transplantation were: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (3 cases), bemoglobinopathies (9 cases), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (1 case) and primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> (6 cases) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Different conditioning regiments were used according to the indication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The study of immune reconstitution was based on the quantitative determination of immunoglobulin and lymphocyte subpopulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These tests were routinely requested to 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months and 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The average time of engraftment was 18 days (12-24) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A rate of CD4+T lymphocytes&gt;200/mm3 was provided within an average of 2,5 months (1-7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The average time to obtain CD8+T lymphocytes&gt;200/mm3 was 2 months (1-5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The humoral immune reconstitution was made within an average of 2 months (1-4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A report of CD4+/CD8+T lymphocytes&gt;I was obtained within 10 months and a half (1-24) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Univaried analysis showed a correlation between the bone marrow sex matched and the faster reorganization of CD8+T cells (p=0.042) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A quantity of CD34+&gt;6 10(6)/kg was significantly associated with the recapture of a formula lymphocyte CD4+/CD8+T&gt;1 (p=0.03) Immune recovery post bone marrow transplantation in children begins with myeloid lineage then lymphoid B then lymphoid T The inversion of the report CD4+/CD8+T lymphocytes, seems to be influenced by the high contain of CD34+cells in the graft as well as the type of conditioning </plain></SENT>
