<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Horse ATG has been replaced by rabbit ATG in many countries due to the unavailability of the former product </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was designed to assess if these ATG preparations are interchangeable in the preparative regimen for matched related BMT in SAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Forty consecutive BMTs were retrospectively analyzed: 20 received Cy plus horse ATG and 20 received Cy plus rabbit ATG as the preparative regimen </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Earlier cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation (40 versus 50 days; P = .02) was observed with rabbit ATG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>An inferior lymphocyte count on days +30 (0.360 versus 0.814 × 10(9)/L; P = .01) and +90 (0.744 versus 1.330 × 10(9)/L; P = .006) was noticed in recipients of rabbit ATG </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that horse and rabbit ATG preparations have different biological and clinical properties and should not be used interchangeably in the preparative regimen for related BMT in SAA </plain></SENT>
