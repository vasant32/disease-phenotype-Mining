<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We previously demonstrated that high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (200 mg/kg) without hematopoietic stem cell transplantation leads to durable complete remissions in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and other <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disorders</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We now examine the ability of high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> to eliminate alloreactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: IgG-specific antibodies to HLA class I were assayed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays in 18 consecutive patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> before and after treatment with high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Anti-HLA antibodies were detected before or shortly after therapy in 5 of the 18 patients studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Complete remission of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> was achieved in four of these five patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>High-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> markedly reduced anti-HLA antibody titers in these four patients; they were completely eradicated in three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only one patient did not achieve significant reduction in the alloantibody titer after high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: High-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> without stem cell transplantation can eradicate HLA-specific alloantibody </plain></SENT>
