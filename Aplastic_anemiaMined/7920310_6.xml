<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were treated at the time of antigenemia in the absence of other signs of CMV disease with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="465284">ganciclovir</z:chebi> (n = 13) or foscarnet (n = 12) if the WBC count was &lt; 2.5 x 10(9)/l or the patient had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The two groups were comparable for age, sex and disease status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were more patients receiving T cell-depleted grafts in the foscarnet group (58% vs 15%, p = 0.003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The first course of treatment was planned to last a minimum of 10 days: foscarnet was given at 180 mg/kg/day, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="465284">ganciclovir</z:chebi> at 10 mg/kg/day </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Maintenance treatment was given for 3-4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>End-points of the study were (1) clearing of CMV antigenemia, (2) tolerance and side-effects, and (3) progression to CMV disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both agents were effective in clearing CMV antigenemia: 14 of 25 patients were CMV antigen-negative by day 14 of treatment and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> surviving patients were negative by day +50 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Renal toxicity was seen mainly in the foscarnet group but caused discontinuation of the drug only in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Myelotoxicity was seen in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="465284">ganciclovir</z:chebi> group and again could be controlled in 12 of 13 patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
