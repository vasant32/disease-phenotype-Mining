<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors used flow cytometry to study 10 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They used a comprehensive panel of monoclonal antibodies against <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> nine currently known GPI-linked surface proteins (CD14, CD16, CD24, CD48, CD55, CD58, CD59, CD67, CD73) on cells of various lineages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Deficient cells were identified in the granulocytic-monocytic and erythroid lineages in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, the lymphoid lineage was affected in only eight patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patterns of deficiency were variable, with deficient cells constituting a part to <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the cells in the lineages tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Certain proteins, including CD16, CD58, and CD59, appeared to be preferentially expressed, despite severe deficiencies of other GPI-linked proteins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, a trimodal pattern of expression of CD16, CD48, and CD59 was observed, in which a population of cells with intermediate levels of expression were identified in addition to positive and deficient cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The authors' findings indicated a great degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> in the patterns and levels of expression of the GPI-linked proteins in the various cell types, as well as a possible <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> in lineage involvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The different patterns of expression of GPI-linked proteins should be considered when using flow cytometry to diagnose <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Finally, the clinical progression in some of the patients suggested a possible link between <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
