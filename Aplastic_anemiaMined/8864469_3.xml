<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There is evidence that the immune response and, specifically, T cells and monocytes have a major role in both HCV- and HBV-induced liver damage </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We suggest that treatment with CAMPATH-1G followed by T cell-depleted BMT and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> could be a novel mode of therapy for <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> non-A, non-B, non-C <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo>-induced liver damage and associated SAA </plain></SENT>
