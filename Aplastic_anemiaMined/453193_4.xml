<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On time course observations the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> of human erythroid precursors assayable in culture was demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To evaluate human erythropoiesis in vitro, the benzidine-positive colonies were divided into three groups: small colony, containing 8-50 cells; medium-sized colony, containing 50-500 cells; and large colony, containing more than 500 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The majority of the large colonies assumed the <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of erythropietic bursts (BFU-E) consisted of several subcolonies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The small colonies were counted as CFU-E1, the medium-sized as CFU-E2, and the large as BFU-E to evaluate the erythroid precursor cell compartment in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The marrow concentration of CFU-E1 and CFU-E2 was shown to be quantitatively diminished in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, there was no ability of the marrow cells from aplastic patieints to grow BFU-E in vitro even in the presence of a large dose of erythropoietin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This lack of BFU-E colony growth may play an important role in the mechanism of the erythropoietic deficiency in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
