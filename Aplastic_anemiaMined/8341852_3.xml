<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have hypothesized that total body irradiation (TBI) which has been used for pretreatment may influence the subsequent development of BrOb in patients undergoing allogeneic BMT </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four of 104 patients (3.9%) developed BrOb by clinical and/or pathologic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four of 4 patients (100%) with BrOb had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two of these 4 patients (50%) were alive at the end of 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data demonstrate that <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD is a risk factor for BrOb in patients receiving non-TBI preconditioning regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The similar incidence of BrOb in this population compared to other studies using TBI suggest that the preconditioning regimen is not a factor in the development of BrOb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Further study is needed to confirm these findings </plain></SENT>
