<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have analyzed natural killer (NK) cells in 43 patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, using cytotoxicity assays and microfluorometry with monoclonal antibodies, prior to and after treatment with antithymocyte globulin (ATG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Before treatment, natural killer cell activity (NKa) in both peripheral blood and bone marrow was markedly decreased in 76% of patients as compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although we have measured low NKa in patients receiving large numbers of blood transfusions (means = 150 U of RBCs), six aplastic patients had low NKa in the absence of transfusions, and the average number of transfusions in the total population was low (means = 24) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Purification of larger granular lymphocytes (LGLs) from peripheral blood of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> patients failed to recover significant NKa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Most of these large granular lymphocytes showed few azurophilic granules </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>NKa was appropriately enhanced in these patients samples by exposure of mononuclear cells to either interleukin 2 (IL-2) or interferon (IFN) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analysis of peripheral blood phenotypic markers showed that cells bearing Leu 7 antigen were in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (means = 12% +/- 2%; <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> = 16% +/- 2%), but there was a deficiency of Leu 11+ cells (means = 8% +/- 2%; <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> = 15% +/- 2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The number of Leu 11+ cells was well correlated with NKa </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 13 of 22 patients treated with ATG, NKa returned to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range, and recovery of NKa was correlated to hematopoietic recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that deficient NKa is an intrinsic feature of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, and that the circulating cells in this disease are of the pre-NK cell stage </plain></SENT>
