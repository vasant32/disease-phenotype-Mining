<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Low levels and long term exposure to <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> is associated with hematotoxicity including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Current biomonitoring methods such as urinary <z:chebi fb="43" ids="15882">phenol</z:chebi>, S-phenylmercapturic acid, and trans-trans <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38407">muconic acid</z:chebi> were found to be unreliable as analytical methods to detect <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, to search for a specific protein for biomonitoring <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> exposure, we investigated plasma proteins from workers (n = 50) at a printing company who were exposed to <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi>, by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The protein profiles are significantly different (p &lt; 0.05) between <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> exposed and unexposed groups, as identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time of flight mass spectrometry and confirmed by Western blot analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>T cell receptor beta chain (TCR beta), FK506-binding protein, and matrix metalloproteinase-13 were expressed only in <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> exposed workers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, interleukin-4 receptor alpha chain and T cell surface <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> CD1b precursor were found to be up-regulated in the plasma of <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> exposed workers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>When we treated Jurkat cells with <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> (10 microM-10 mM), TCR beta expression was increased in the membrane more than 6-9-fold compared to untreated cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, the amount of TCR beta released into the culture media, at <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> concentrations greater than 50 microM, increased up to 10 mM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, TCR beta levels in plasma could be used as a biomarker and a possible therapeutic target for <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> exposure </plain></SENT>
