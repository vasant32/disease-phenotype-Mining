<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CD4+ T cells are divided into Th1 cells producing hematopoietic inhibitory cytokines like interferon-gamma and Th2 cells producing interleukin-4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the Th1/Th2 cell ratio in the peripheral blood of AA patients treated with immunosuppressive therapy (IST) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were 10 patients who responded well to IST (responders) and 3 patients who were refractory to IST (non-responders) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Th1 cells were lower in responders than in non-responders (16.2+/-2.4% vs. 28.8+/-5.5%, respectively, p&lt;0.05), whereas Th2 cells did not differ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The Th1/Th2 ratio was also significantly lower in responders than in non-responders, being 13.2+/-1.5 and 40.4+/-5.1 (p&lt;0.001), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In three responders, the Th1/Th2 ratio was declined according to the hematological recovery (from 10.6 to 8.3, 16.3 to 10.9 and 11.8 to 9.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results suggest that Th1 lymphocytes are more predominant in AA, and it may be very useful to monitor the Th1/Th2 ratio during IST </plain></SENT>
