<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most studies indicate that transient cardiac toxicity occurs within weeks of transplantation, but few studies have evaluated either cardiac status before or late after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cardiac performance was assessed via cycle ergometry in 20 children and young adults before transplantation and 31 other children and young adults after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Mean survival time in the group post-transplantation was 3.9 years with a range of 11 months to 12.1 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Left ventricular size and shortening fraction at rest were assessed via echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Data were compared to those of 70 healthy subjects from our laboratory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients before and after transplantation had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> oxygen consumptions and cardiac indices at rest </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>During exercise, however, patients treated for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> both before and after bone marrow transplantation had reduced exercise times, reduced maximal oxygen consumptions, and reduced ventilatory anaerobic thresholds </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cardiac reserve, as judged by the response of the cardiac output during exercise, was reduced severely </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no significant differences between the groups tested before and after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients who had been treated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, who had received less intensive therapy before transplantation, performed significantly better than did patients treated for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Despite these findings, only four patients had abnormalities by echocardiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, before transplantation patients with oncologic diagnoses had serious limitations in exercise performance, most likely as a result of the effects of the cardiotoxic therapy given as part of their conventional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Long-term survivors of bone marrow transplantation also had similar abnormalities.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
