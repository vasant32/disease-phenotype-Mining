<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, felbamate therapy has been limited due to the associated reports of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0235378,C0348754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Injury or Poisoning" abbrv="">hepatotoxicity</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Previous research from our laboratory has proposed 2-phenylpropenal as the reactive metabolite in felbamate bioactivation and identified its mercapturates in the urine of rats and patients undergoing felbamate therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>While the reaction between 2-phenylpropenal and GSH has been shown to occur spontaneously under physiological conditions, the potential catalysis by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> transferases (GST) has remained unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The work presented here demonstrates a role for GST in the detoxification of 2-phenylpropenal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The kinetic data show that 2-phenylpropenal is a substrate for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three isoforms tested, with a k(cat)/K(m) of 0.275 +/- 0.035 microM(-1) s(-1) for GSTM1-1, 0.164 +/- 0.005 microM(-1) s(-1) for GSTP1-1, and 0.042 +/- 0.005 microM(-1) s(-1) for GSTA1-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Given that electrophilic substrates such as 2-propenal have been shown to inhibit GSTs, we also examined the inhibition of GSTM1-1, GSTP1-1 and GSTA1-1 by 2-phenylpropenal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0877008" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">enzyme inhibition</z:e> studies demonstrate that 2-phenylpropenal inhibits GSTP1-1 and GSTM1-1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The inhibition of GSTP1-1 was completely reversible upon filtration and reconstitution in buffer containing 10 mM GSH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, 2-phenylpropenal inhibition of GSTM1-1 was irreversible under the same conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The irreversible inhibition of GSTM1-1 may be important in understanding the toxicities associated with felbamate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Given that 2-phenylpropenal is both a substrate and irreversible inhibitor for GSTM1-1, GSTM1-1 represents a potential target for 2-phenylpropenal haptenization in vivo, which may in turn mediate the observed idiosyncratic reactions </plain></SENT>
