<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Peripheral blood T lymphocytes from 10 patients with AA and 10 healthy volunteers were isolated, purified and cultured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>T lymphocytes from the patients were divided into 0, 100, 200 and 400 µg/ml brucine-treated groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>T lymphocytes from healthy volunteers were used as control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After being cultured for 72 hours, the levels of TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-4 in the supernatant of cultured T lymphocytes from AA patients were detected by ELISA, and the proliferation of T lymphocytes from AA patients was detected by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results showed that compared with the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control group, the levels of TNF-α and IFN-γ in the culture supernatant significantly increased, and IL-4 was significantly decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The levels of TNF-α and IFN-γ in the culture supernatant of brucine treated groups were lower, and were dependent on the concentration of brucine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the levels of IL-4 were found to be not obviously changed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The inhibition rate of T lymphocytes in 100, 200 and 400µg/ml brucine-treated groups were (13.61 ± 4.31)%, (14.28 ± 4.31)% and (15.12 ± 4.56)% respectively, among which the differences were not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the brucine can reduce the levels of TNF-α and IFN-γ through inhibiting the proliferation of T lymphocytes in AA patients, which provides experimental basis for therapy of AA patients </plain></SENT>
