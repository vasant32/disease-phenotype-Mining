<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients were randomized to receive ATG and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> (PDN) or CsA; hematological response and toxicity were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At 3 months, patients who had no or minimal response received the alternative therapy in order to assess the value of a sequential immunosuppressive therapy for treatment of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One hundred and sixteen patients were analysed, 60 received CsA and 56 received ATG/PDN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The actuarial survival was 55% with a median follow-up time of 19 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in survival between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The main prognostic factor was the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) at entry: patients with ANC less than 0.2 x 10(9)/L had a significantly lower survival when compared with patients with an ANC greater than 0.2 x 10(9)/L (P = 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At 3 months, 16% of patients had a complete or partial response and a cross-over treatment was given to 68 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At 12 months, 77 patients were alive, with a complete or partial response in 47 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients who had responded to the first treatment had a better recovery of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> than those who had a sequential immunosuppression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The main complication was <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> which was more often observed and was more often lethal during ATG and PDN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrates that CsA is comparable to ATG for primary treatment of SAA, but it is less toxic with fewer infectious <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
