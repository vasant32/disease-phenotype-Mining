<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To observe the clinical efficacy of TCM for reinforcing Shen and activating blood circulation to dredge Channels in auxiliary treating <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (CAA), and to explore its mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Seventy-nine patients with CAA were randomly divided into the treated group treated with TCM plus western medicine and the control group treated with western medicine alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The clinical efficacy was observed and levels of plasma sFas and sFasL before and after treatment were determined by ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The basic cure rate and total effective rate in the treated group were 37.50% and 87.50%; while in the control group were 20 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>51% and 61.54% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Comparison between the two groups showed significant difference (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The sFas level was markedly lower in both groups before treatment, but after treatment, it got elevated in the treated group significantly (P &lt; 0.05), as compared with that in the control group, the difference was significant (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: TCM is effective in treating CAA with less toxic and side-effect, the mechanism might be the inhibition on over <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of hematopoietic cells in CAA patients through regulating immune function of organism </plain></SENT>
