<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>More controversial are young-to-middle-aged adults with an HLA-identical sibling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Because of comparable survival rates, some centers advocate BMT; others advocate immunosuppression as primary treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>BMT cures severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (SAA), but has a higher early mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunosuppression usually induces hemopoietic improvement and has hardly any early mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, there are late problems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After immunosuppression, there may be relapse and clonal hematopoietic disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After BMT, there may be late graft failure, severe or even fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host-disease</z:e> (GVHD) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Retrospective studies show no significant differences in long-term survival between the two treatment modalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In patients over the age of 40, immunosuppression is favored by most centers because in this age group there is a very high transplant-related mortality with BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="5" ids="50113">Androgens</z:chebi> and hematopoietic growth factors have hardly any role in therapy of SAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Splenectomy helps some patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> and problems with supportive care, but does not improve the overall prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>BMT with unrelated donors has usually been performed in late stages of the disease with disappointing results </plain></SENT>
