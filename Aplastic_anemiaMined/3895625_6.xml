<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A total of 144 evaluations of cell surface markers and cellular immune functions were carried out in 57 patients undergoing allogeneic bone marrow transplantation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> in remission and relapse and for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The periods tested were pretransplant, and 1-3, 4-6, 7-12 and more than 12 months posttransplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The determination consisted of lymphocyte counts; lymphocyte surface marking using OKT3, OKT4, and OKT8 antibodies; and determination of adherent cells, lysozymes and antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) against chicken red blood cells, human red blood cells, and CEM cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Natural killer cells were determined against K562 target cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lymphoblastic responses were tested after stimulation with pokeweed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi> (PWM), concanavalin-A (Con-A), and phytohemagglutinin (PHA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found that the progression in the leukemic state (first remission, second remission, and relapse), prior to transplantation was paralleled by a decrease in T4 lymphocytes (976/microliter +/- 462; 411/microliter +/- 222; 372/microliter +/- 419; P = .04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was a lack of helper cells and an inverted T4:T8 ratio beyond one year posttransplant independent of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Lymphocyte functions persisted to be depressed for more than one year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We found a direct correlation of T4 helper cells and an inverse correlation of T8 suppressor cells with lymphoblastic responses to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogens</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is hoped that the longitudinal evaluations of immune functions after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, and the characterization of the immune defects seen may lead to better immunorestorative treatments </plain></SENT>
