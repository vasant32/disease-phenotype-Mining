<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The novel TT virus, a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9160">single-stranded DNA</z:chebi> virus first isolated from the serum of a patient with post-transfusion <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> in Japan might cause this condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, our group subjected the sera of two children with post-<z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> to semi-nested PCR using primers specific for detection of TTV DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although TTV DNA was not detectable in either sample it might be speculated that, like <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> viruses A to G, TTV could be found associated with this condition whereas it certainly does not constitute its sole etiologic agent </plain></SENT>
