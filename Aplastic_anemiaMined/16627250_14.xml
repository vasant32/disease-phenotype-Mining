<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We looked for mutations in telomerase <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> (TERC) and telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) in 96 Japanese children with acquired AA and in 76 healthy controls </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Novel heterozygous, non-synonymous mutations in TERT (T726M and G682D) were found in two patients with AA, neither of whom had clinical characteristics suggesting constitutional AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This genetic difference does not explain the higher incidence of AA in Asian populations </plain></SENT>
