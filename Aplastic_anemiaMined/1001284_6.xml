<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mean mephenytoin level was 8% of the combined mephenytoin plus nirvanol levels. "Total mephenytoin" level should be used clinically, as neither individual component is as well correlated with clinical phenomena </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serum levels of 25 to 40 mug/ml usually yield improvement in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizure</z:hpo> control without discomfort, and three-quarters of patients had fewer <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Side effects frequently associated with phenytoin were absent, but <z:hpo ids='HP_0002329'>drowsiness</z:hpo>, an occasional <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015230" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rash</z:e>, and a single, fatal case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Performance on psychological tests of cognitive-attentional skills showed a modest improvement during mephenytoin administration </plain></SENT>
