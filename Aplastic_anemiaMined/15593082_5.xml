<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An enhanced myeloid response and decreased <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> risk may be possible with the addition of a hematopoietic cytokine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Published data on the combination of cytokines and IS in patients with SAA are limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The addition of G-CSF to IS shortens the time to neutrophil count recovery, but may not improve overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Because GM-CSF acts differently than G-CSF, its use in combination with IS may be different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PROCEDURE: A retrospective chart review was performed on patients diagnosed with SAA and treated with IS and GM-CSF at St </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Jude Children's Research Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Hematologic recovery, prognostic factors, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> data were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eighteen patients were included in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The median age at diagnosis was 7.2 years (range 1.8-17.0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Ten patients (56%) had a complete response, four (22%) a partial response, and four (22%) no response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Median time to erythrocyte and platelet transfusion independence were 90 (18,243) and 64 days (18-243), and to discontinuation of treatment 287 days (90-730) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Median time to partial (ANC &gt; 500) and full (ANC &gt; 1,500) neutrophil recovery were 41 and 51 days, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Seventeen documented discrete <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> occurred in six patients over 36 patient years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: GM-CSF, in addition to IS, may shorten time to neutrophil count recovery, may be beneficial in decreasing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> rates, and may improve platelet response in patients with SAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>However, consistent with studies utilizing G-CSF, GM-CSF probably does not affect overall response rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>To fully answer whether or not cytokine therapy is of added value to IS in pediatric patients, a multi-institutional randomized trial is needed </plain></SENT>
