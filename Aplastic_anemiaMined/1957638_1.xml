<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have observed two patients who exhibited an exclusive increase of delta TCS1+ subset of gamma delta T cells in the peripheral blood after bone marrow transplantation (BMT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In one case with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004430'>severe combined immunodeficiency</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0002536'>SCID</z:mp>) who received haploidentical BMT from his father, gamma delta T cells appeared only after thymus transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, his T cell-mediated immunity remained severely defective despite the generation of T cells of donor origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the other case with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, delta TCS1- gamma delta T cells began to increase in the peripheral blood later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This indicates that the thymus is necessary for the generation of gamma delta T cells and that the delta TCS1+ subset is dominant in the early stages of their ontogeny. delta TCS1+ T cell lines were established from both patients, and allo-reactivity was investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The cell line from the latter case reacted to recipient cells in a mixed lymphocyte reaction, but did not show cytotoxity to the allogeneic cells including recipient cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The other cell line, from the former case, did not react to either donor or recipient cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This indicates that an intact thymus is needed for gamma delta T cells to acquire allo-reactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both cell lines showed MHC non-restricted cytotoxity against NK-sensitive target cells </plain></SENT>
