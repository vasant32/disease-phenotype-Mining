<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Platelet glycocalicin (GC) is the extramembranous portion of GPIb alpha that can be rapidly cleaved by enzymes such as calpain, plasmin, trypsin, elastase, etc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Quantitative cleavage will ultimately result in an acquired Bernard-Soulier-like <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> disorder, and circulating GC may act as a potential inhibitor of platelet <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have developed and standardized a new enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), which uses two monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), both of which bind to the amino-terminal 45-kD fragment of GC and inhibit platelet-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">von Willebrand</z:e> interactions and the streptavidin-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="15956">biotin</z:chebi> system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>First, the methodology was evaluated and standardized with special emphasis on the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50249">anticoagulant</z:chebi> and the inhibitors (EDTA, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15544">prostaglandin E1</z:chebi> [<z:chebi fb="0" ids="15544">PGE1</z:chebi>], aprotinin, N-ethyl-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16072">maleimide</z:chebi>), the mode of high-speed centrifugation (to avoid platelet microparticles), and the standards used (purified GPIb and GC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This assay was then used to analyze the GC levels of healthy subjects (2.04 +/- 0.46 micrograms/mL) and of patients with selected diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001894'>thrombocytosis</z:hpo> confirmed that GC levels are clearly dependent on the platelet count, which was the basis for the introduction of the GC index, the standardization of GC for a platelet count of 250 x 10(9)/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The GC index discriminates reliably patients with active immune thrombocytopenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000979'>purpura</z:hpo> from those in remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>GC levels are elevated in patients on hemodialysis (3.62 +/- 0.75 micrograms/mL, P &lt; .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The high GC index (6.93 +/- 4.21, P &lt; .001) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo> patients suggests an increased platelet turnover and/or abnormal proteolysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast to other groups, we have not found that recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) treatment of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo> increases GC levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However, concentrations are elevated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and the highest levels found are approximately 40 micrograms/mL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These studies suggest that GC is a useful platelet marker in certain diseases, which directly reflects platelet damage and possibly platelet dysfunction </plain></SENT>
