<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The role of spleen in the pathogeny of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (A.A.) related to excessive suppression, and the value of splenectomy in the treatment of this disorder is still debated and unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In an attempt to find out why some patients respond to surgery and others do not, an immunologic study was carried out in 16 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Lymphocytes surface markers CD3, CD4, CD8, HLA-DR, Fc receptors (FcR) and CD4/CD8 ratio were determined before and after splenectomy in the patients' peripheral blood, and in the spleen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, the number of granulo-monocytic colony forming cells (GM-CFC) before and after splenectomy was estimated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nine of the cases showed increased CD3+ CD8+ FcR+ cells, reversed CD4/CD8 ratios (both, in peripheral blood and in spleen), and a low number of GM-CFC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> these cases, splenectomy induced an improvement of the clinical, hematological, and immunological parameters, thus suggesting that spleen represents an important "reservoir" for CD3+ CD8+ FcR+ cells, which seem to exert a suppressor effect on the hematopoietic progenitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In splenectomized patients who did not respond to surgery, the pathogenic mechanism was probably related to defective help (3 cases with low values of CD4+ cells), to defective suppression (2 cases with decreased number of CD8+ cells), to a stem cell defect or a deficiency in the stem cell microenvironment (2 cases with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> helper/suppressor ratio) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These observations support the conclusion that splenectomy is indicated and may be successful only when the phenotypic markers show an increased number of CD3+ CD8+ FcR+ cells </plain></SENT>
