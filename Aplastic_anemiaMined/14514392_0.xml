<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 13 SAA patients were chosen with a medium age of 22 years, including 4 untreated patients and 9 nonresponding to previous management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They were treated with 5 mg of CD(3) MoAb per day for a total 10 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The response rate was 11/13, including 2 cured and 2 remission cases during a follow up of 3 to 15 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As compared with the pretreatment condition the proliferation of bone marrow in 8 cases become better; the leukocytes, granulocytes, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> and platelets of peripheral blood increased 1.59 x 10(9)/L, 0.72 x 10(9)/L, 40 g/L and 47 x 10(9)/L respectively (P &lt; 0.01, respectively); the ratio of CD(4)/CD(8) of T cell subsets increased from 1.12 to 1.42 while the expression of HLA-DR antigen decreased from 29.2 to 15.2 (P &lt; 0.01, respectively); TNF alpha, IFN gamma and IL-2 secreted by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNCs) decreased obviously from 267, 784 and 92 to 152, 570 and 51 U/ml on the average respectively (P &lt; 0.01, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The main side effects were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the patients and <z:mp ids='MP_0001954'>shortness of breath</z:mp> in 4 cases, but none died during the therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to other kinds of common immune suppressor, CD(3) MoAb showed better response and probably higher efficacy and safety for SAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is necessary to have more cases and to follow up longer to estimate its long term effect and side effects </plain></SENT>
