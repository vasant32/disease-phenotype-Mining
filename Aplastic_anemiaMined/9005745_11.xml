<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The outcome of transplanting bone marrow from genetically identical twins into patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> may help define how frequently these factors play a role in this condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To determine the outcome of transplanting bone marrow from genetically identical twins into patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Observational study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTING: 31 centers participating in the international Bone Marrow Transplant Registry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: 40 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> who received bone marrow transplants from their genetically identical twins between 1964 and 1992 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: 23 patients received their first bone marrow transplant without pretransplantation conditioning; 17 received it after pretransplantation conditioning with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> alone or combined with other drugs or radiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Six patients received post-transplantation immunosuppressive therapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi>, alone or in combination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS: Outcomes of transplantation, including hematologic recovery and survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Seven of 23 patients who received their first transplant without receiving conditioning had sustained complete hematologic recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One of 16 patients who did not have complete recovery after the first transplantation recovered after a second transplantation, which was not preceded by conditioning </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The other 15 patients had two to five transplantations that were preceded by conditioning; in 13 patients, sustained bone marrow function was recovered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Twelve of 17 patients whose first transplantation was preceded by conditioning had sustained complete hematologic recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The likelihood of hematologic recovery was greater in patients who had conditioning before the first transplantation (P = 0.033) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The actuarial 10-year survival rate for the 40 patients was 78% (95% CI, 59% to 92%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>The survival rate was higher in patients who did not have conditioning before the first transplantation (patients without conditioning, 87% [range, 65% to 99%]; patients with conditioning, 70% [range, 47% to 89%]; P = 0.037) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Most patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> recover bone marrow function after receiving a transplant from a genetically identical twin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Pretransplantation conditioning may increase the chance of bone marrow recovery but does not seem to improve survival </plain></SENT>
