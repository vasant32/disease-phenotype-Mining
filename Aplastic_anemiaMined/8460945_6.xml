<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we purified urinary human erythropoietin from three independent groups of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> patients, and analyzed the structures of mucin-type sugar chains as well as that obtained from recombinant human erythropoietin produced by Chinese hamster ovary cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Unlike the N-linked sugar chains, the mucin-type sugar chains are totally different between the urinary and the recombinant erythropoietins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the three independent samples of urinary erythropoietin contained <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50699">oligosaccharides</z:chebi> with the structures of +/- Neu5Ac alpha 2--&gt;6GalNAc, while recombinant human erythropoietin contained those with the structures of Neu5Ac alpha 2--&gt;3Gal beta 1--&gt;3(Neu5Ac alpha 2--&gt;6)GalNAc, Neu5Ac alpha 2--&gt;3Gal beta 1--&gt;3GalNAc, and <z:chebi fb="125" ids="28260">Gal</z:chebi> beta 1--&gt;3(Neu5Ac alpha 2--&gt;6)GalNAc </plain></SENT>
