<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The anti-T monoclonal antibodies used were 35.1 (CD2), Tp120 (CD6) and ATL27 (not clustered) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Treatment of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow with anti-T monoclonal antibodies and complement resulted in complete (greater than 99%) lysis of T cells with negligible effects on colony growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Preincubation of marrow samples with monoclonal antibodies and complement did not enhance CFU-GM or BFU-E colony growth in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using this assay, there was no evidence of T cell-mediated inhibition of colony proliferation in any of 29 patients </plain></SENT>
