<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Diamond-Blackfan <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi>) is a rare <z:hpo ids='HP_0004810'>congenital hypoplastic anemia</z:hpo> caused by mutations in ribosomal protein (RP) genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our aim is to develop gene therapy for <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> patients with mutations in RPS19 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We previously demonstrated that RPS19 gene transfer partially corrects erythroid development in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this study, we asked if RPS19 gene transfer corrects erythroid development in unsorted cells transplanted to immunodeficient mice and if the RPS19-corrected fraction has a proliferative advantage after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We further determined if high level of RPS19 expression is required for correction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Mobilized peripheral blood CD34(+) cells were transduced by oncoretroviral vector particles pseudotyped with the feline endogenous retrovirus envelope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Vectors containing two different promoters with different RPS19 transgene expression levels were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Transduced cells were transplanted to immunocompromised nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient-beta2 microglobulin null mice in order to assess therapeutic effects of RPS19 gene transfer in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: We show that correction of erythroid development requires high RPS19 expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The corrected fraction of unselected <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> cells have a survival advantage in vivo, suggesting that successful gene therapy may only require correction of a fraction of the patient cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our findings are fundamental for development of clinical gene therapy for <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> because they demonstrate increased engraftment of RPS19-transduced cells without selection of gene-corrected cells prior to transplantation, an essential prelude to studying long-term therapeutic effects in emerging animal models for <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
