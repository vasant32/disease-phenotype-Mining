<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The indications for transplant in the combined group of 27 patients were <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphoblastic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemia</z:mpath> in 14 cases (52%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_342'>myeloid leukaemia</z:mpath> in 11 cases (41%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> in two cases (7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Transplants were autologous in five cases (19%) and allogeneic in 22 cases (81%); of the 22 allogeneic transplants, 16 donors were HLA-matched siblings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients the conditioning regimen included total body irradiation of 7.5 Gy or more, and/or contained <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> of 120 mg/kg or more </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seven patients (26%) had fatal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024115" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary disease</z:e> including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0032285" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PNEUM">pneumonitis</z:e> and <z:mp ids='MP_0001182'>pulmonary hemorrhage</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Five patients (19%) had significant airway problems including three with severe mucositis who required intubation for airway protection, one with severe mucositis with partial <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001883" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">airway obstruction</z:e> that required observation in the intensive care unit but did not require intubation, and one with Candida albicans <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023067" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">laryngitis</z:e> with development of a glottic web </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Nineteen patients (70%) survived beyond 100 days post-transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was no clear association between 100-day survival and the use of any particular agent or regimen used for conditioning or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> prophylaxis, and the majority of patients tolerated high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, high-dose <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22601">arabinoside</z:chebi>, high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi>, total body irradiation, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There appeared to be more early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in patients who received the combination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> and total body irradiation, compared with those receiving the combination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> or those receiving the combination of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16040">cytosine</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22601">arabinoside</z:chebi> and total body irradiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Also, the use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> was associated with a greater number of early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, compared with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>At 3 years, life table estimates of freedom from relapse, relapse-free survival and survival were 75%, 44% and 48%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The estimated cumulative risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> due to a non-leukaemic cause at 3 years was 39% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The data show that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Down syndrome</z:e> patients can tolerate the commonly used transplant conditioning regimens with acceptable toxicity; however, there is a strong suggestion in the data that the rates of life-threatening and fatal toxicity are higher than would be expected to occur in patients without <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Down's syndrome</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0013080" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Congenital Abnormality" abbrv="">Down's syndrome</z:e> may have a predisposition to fatal pulmonary complications and reversible airway problems during the immediate post-transplant period </plain></SENT>
