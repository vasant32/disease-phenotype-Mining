<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the expression of iNOS in bone marrow (BM) mononuclear cells (MNCs) using a reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay and the concentration of NO from BM serum by measuring the metabolite <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29272">NO(2)</z:chebi>(-) in 13 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) compared with 10 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls who were donors for allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When we measured the density of bands for both iNOS and beta(2)-microglobin expressed as the iNOS/beta(2)-microglobin density ratio, there was a significant difference in the ratio between AA and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (0.88+/-0.15 vs 0.26+/-0.05, P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The BM serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29272">NO(2)</z:chebi>(-) concentration in the patients with AA was significantly higher than that of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (88.1+/-32.8 microM vs 48.8+/-8.6 microM, P=0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, there was a significant correlation between the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29272">NO(2)</z:chebi>(-) concentration and the calculated iNOS/beta(2)-microglobin density ratio (r=0.567, P=0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that upregulation of iNOS expression for local NO production may contribute in part to the pathogenesis of AA </plain></SENT>
