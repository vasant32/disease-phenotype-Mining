<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A prognostic formula was devised by multivariate analysis for prediction of short-term survivors at diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>: Using the initial percentage of nonmyeloid cells in the marrow aspirate and the neutrophil count in peripheral blood, survival of less than 4 months is predicted with a probability of 89% (sensitivity 80%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The lowest blood counts during the course of the disease are useful to predict the outcome in more <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> courses of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>: A <z:hpo ids='HP_0001896'>reticulocytopenia</z:hpo> below 5 X 10(9)/1, a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> below 0.1 X 10(9)/1 or a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> below 5 X 10(9)/1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> resulted in an ultimate mortality of over 90% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, if none of these threshold values were reached, a 4 year survival of 71% was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, 5 X 10(9) reticulocytes/1, 0.1 X 10(9) neutrophils/1 and 5 X 10(9) platelets/1 form a group of risk factors to predict a fatal or favorable outcome throughout the course of the disease </plain></SENT>
