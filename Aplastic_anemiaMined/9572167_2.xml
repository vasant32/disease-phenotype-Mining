<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The etiology is uncertain, and the treatment of choice, bone marrow transplant, is contraindicated in pregnancy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, the occurrence of this complication during gestation presents a management challenge </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Concurrent immune-mediated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> further complicates an already complex situation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CASE: Our patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and immune-mediated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> was diagnosed during the third trimester of pregnancy and treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi>/high-dose intravenous (i.v.) immunoglobulin (Ig) and multiple transfusions of packed red blood cells and platelets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fetal surveillance included twice-weekly non-stress tests coupled with sequential sonographic pregnancy evaluation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A successful term vaginal delivery was achieved with good maternal and perinatal outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Selective transfusion of blood products, therapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi>, high-dose i.v </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ig, and intensive fetal surveillance resulted in a successful maternal and perinatal outcome for a pregnancy complicated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and immune-mediated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
