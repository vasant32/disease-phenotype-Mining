<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Immunusuppressive therapy (IST) is a key treatment strategy for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>; since 20 years the standard IST for AA patients has been anti-thymocyte globuline (ATG) plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> A (CyA), which results in response rates ranging between 50% and 70%, and even higher overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, primary and secondary failures after IST remain frequent, and to date <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> attempts aiming to overcome this problem have been unfruitful </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Here we review the state of the art of IST for AA in 2010, focusing on possible strategies to improve current treatments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We also discuss very recent data which question the equality of different ATG preparations, leading to a possible reconsideration of the current standards of care for AA patients </plain></SENT>
