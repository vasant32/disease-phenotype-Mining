<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To explore the effect of kidney-reinforcing, blood-activating and stasis-removing recipes on <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule expression of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (CAA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We used three Traditional Chinese Medicine recipes, namely a kidney-reinforcing recipe (KRR), blood-activating and stasis-removing recipe (BASRR), and kidney-reinforcing, blood-activating and stasis-removing recipe (KRBASRR), and a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> saline control to prepare herbal medicine serum in Sprague Dawley rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty CAA patients were enrolled in the experimental group, including 17 kidney-Yang deficient patients and 13 kidney-Yin deficient patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ten healthy individuals were included in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MSCs were isolated from bone marrow samples, and the cell density was observed to measure their proliferation ability by microscopy on days 2, 7, and 14 after isolation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In addition, the expression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules of bone marrow MSCs (CD106, CD49d, CD31 and CD44) were detected by flow cytometry after 48 h of treatment with the four different herbal medicine serums </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The proliferation of MSCs from kidney-Yang deficient and kidney-Yin deficient patients was weaker than that of MSCs from the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The expression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules of bone marrow MSCs from CAA patients was obviously lower than that in the control group (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The expression of CD49d and CD31 in MSCs from patients with a kidney-Yin deficiency was lower than in those with a kidney-yang deficiency (P &lt; 0.05 and P &lt; 0.01, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For kidney-Yang deficient patients, CD31 expression in the KRBASRR group was significantly higher than that in the BASRR group (P &lt; 0.01), while CD44 in the KRBASRR group was significantly higher than that in both KRR and BASRR groups (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>For kidney-Yin deficient patients, CD106 and CD49d expression in the KRBASRR group was obviously higher than that in the KRR group (P &lt; 0.05), while CD31 and CD44 expression in the KRBASRR group was significantly higher than that in both KRR and BASRR groups (P &lt; 0.05 and P &lt; 0.01, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The bone marrow microenvironment in CAA patients is abnormal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The effect of KRBASRR may be better than that of KRR and BASRR for kidney-Yang deficient and kidney-Yin deficient patients by improving the expression levels of MSC <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules </plain></SENT>
