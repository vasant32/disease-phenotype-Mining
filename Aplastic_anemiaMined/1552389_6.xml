<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but two patients (one with TEC; one with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>), erythropoietin was measured at diagnosis, before institution of specific therapy for the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There was a statistically significant inverse linear correlation between log10 erythropoietin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> values for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patient groups (r = 0.904 to 0.912; p less than 0.005) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A comparison of the slopes of the regressions for each patient group by analysis of covariance revealed a significantly steeper slope for the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0240066" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron deficiency</z:e> group (-0.553) versus the TEC (-0.287) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (-0.256) groups (p = 0.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The difference in erythropoietin levels appeared greatest in patients whose presenting <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> level was greater than 5 gm/dl </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Decline in serum erythropoietin levels was more precipitous in the less severely anemic patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001891'>iron deficiency anemia</z:hpo> than in the patients with TEC or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data reveal quantitative and qualitative differences in the relationship between serum erythropoietin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> levels when children with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001891'>iron deficiency anemia</z:hpo> versus those with TEC or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> are considered, even though <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three conditions are characterized by hypoproliferation of erythrocytes </plain></SENT>
