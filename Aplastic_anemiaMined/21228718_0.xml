<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Genetic polymorphism of the detoxifying enzymes, the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi>-S-transferase (GST) and microsomal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32955">epoxide</z:chebi> hydrolase (mEh), with alteration in their activities could explain the genetic interindividual risks for AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We aimed to characterize the genetic polymorphisms of the GST and mEh and to test their impact on the susceptibility, disease severity, and prognosis in Egyptian patients with AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The GST and mEh genotypes were determined by multiplex-polymerase chain reaction and polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis, respectively, in 21 patients with AA and 20 healthy control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mEh functional phenotypes were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The frequency of GST θ1-null genotype was found significantly higher in AA patients compared with the controls (odds ratio=2.8, 95% confidence interval = 1.1-7.8; P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The frequency of heterozygous 139A--G of the mEh gene was significantly higher in AA patients compared with the controls (odds ratio=3.07, 95% confidence interval = 1.23-7.7; P = 0.018) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Moreover, the patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> functional phenotype of the mEh had significantly favorable prognosis than those with abnormal enzyme activity (P = 0.027) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, the GST θ1-null genotype and the 139A--G mEh gene polymorphism may enhance the susceptibility to AA and provide an evidence of gene-environmental interaction </plain></SENT>
