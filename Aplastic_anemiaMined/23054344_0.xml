<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>Aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) is an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> and interleukin-27 (IL-27) is an important cytokine involved in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To date there have been no reports concerning the intrinsic association among IL-27 and Thelper (Th) 1 and Th17 cells in AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to assay IL-27, interferon gamma (IFN-γ) and IL-17 levels, flow cytometry to measure the percentages of Th1 and Th17 cells among peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels of IL-27, IFN-γ, T-bet and IL-17 and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26537">retinoid</z:chebi> related orphan receptor gamma (RORγt) in PBMCs were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In addition, the effect of exogenous rhIL-27 on the differentiation of T cells into Th1 and Th17 cells was investigated in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Plasma and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels of IL-27 in PBMCs from AA patients were significantly higher than those in healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A positive correlation was found between plasma levels of IL27 and IFN-γ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The proportions of Th1 and Th17 cells accompanied by the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of RORγt and T-bet were significantly higher in AA patients than in healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Plasma levels of IL-27 correlated positively with frequencies of Th1 cells in AA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Exogenous rhIL-27 could significantly upregulate the frequency of Th1 cells and the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> levels of T-bet and IFN-γ and the application of rhIL-27 in vitro could inhibit the expression of RORγt <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The upregulation of IL-27 might cause Th1 differentiation and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0947760" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">immune disorders</z:e> in AA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Blocking the expression of IL-27 could therefore be a reasonable therapeutic strategy for AA </plain></SENT>
