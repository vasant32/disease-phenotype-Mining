<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: In 1972, the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan defined intractable diseases as those with unknown etiology, no established treatment regimens, and severe sequelae of physical, mental and social difficulties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since then, the Ministry has promoted scientific research on these diseases and offered financial support to those suffering from their effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present study was to analyze trends in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> from the diseases in Japan over the period from 1972-2004 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: For the selected intractable diseases with 100 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> or more per year, crude (CDR) and direct age-standardized <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rates (ADR) were computed using the national underlying-cause-of-<z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> mortality database of Japan based on International Classification of Diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Joinpoint regression analysis was applied to identify significant changes in the trends </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The CDRs in the latest observed year per 1 million persons/year) for males and females were 25.55 and 25.93, respectively, for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">Parkinson's disease</z:e>, 5.41 and 6.92 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, 0.87 and 3.50 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo>, 2.93 and 2.36 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo>, 1.40 and 1.54 for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0031036" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">polyarteritis nodosa</z:e>, 1.34 and 1.61 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001973'>idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura</z:hpo>, and 1.02 and 0.74 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The respective annual percentage changes (APCs) for males and females during the overall period decreased for <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> (-5.2% and -7.5%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (-3.6% and -3.7%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001973'>idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura</z:hpo> (-2.1% and -3.0%), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002725'>systemic lupus erythematosus</z:hpo> (-0.9% and -2.6%), while the APCs increased for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> (+3.3% and +3.5%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0031036" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">polyarteritis nodosa</z:e> (+3.2% and +4.0%), and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">Parkinson's disease</z:e> (+0.7% in males alone) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With the APCs in the latest trend phase, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0031036" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">polyarteritis nodosa</z:e> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030567" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PD">Parkinson's disease</z:e> in females showed appreciable declines; on the other hand, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011034'>amyloidosis</z:hpo> in males demonstrated the significant increase, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100279'>ulcerative colitis</z:hpo> in males exhibited an apparent leveling off of the decline </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The ADRs for most of the intractable diseases have declined significantly in Japan over the last 3 decades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The decline might be attributed in large part to improved diagnosis and treatment because of the lack of effective primary prevention measures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Support for the affected patients and further research on etiology and radical cure of the diseases must be considered necessary </plain></SENT>
