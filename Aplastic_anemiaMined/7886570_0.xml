<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This paper presents the HIV seroprevalence in hematologic patients other than hemophiliacs who received multiple blood transfusion at Ramathibodi Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The retrospective analysis was done on 167 patients: 132 thalassemia, 19 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, 5 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, 5 ITP, 2 pure red cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath>, 2 congenital non spherocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001878'>hemolytic anemia</z:hpo>, 1 hereditary <z:hpo ids='HP_0004444'>spherocytosis</z:hpo> and 1 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001890'>autoimmune hemolytic anemia</z:hpo> patients, who received blood transfusion during January 1, 1987 till February 29, 1992 at the Department of Pediatrics, Ramathibodi Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The number of blood or BC transfused in each patient was 1-154 units with the average of 23 units per patient per 5 years with a total 4,000 units </plain></SENT>
