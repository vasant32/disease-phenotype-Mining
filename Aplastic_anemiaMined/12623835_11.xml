<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Telomere size correlates inversely with the cell division history of <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSCs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In 10 patients with hemolytic <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> the telomeres in sorted GPI- granulocytes were shorter than in sorted GPI+ granulocytes in 4 cases, comparable in 2 cases, and longer in the remaining 4 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the telomeres of both GPI- and GPI+ hematopoietic cells were markedly shortened compared with age-matched controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The short telomeres in the GPI- cells probably reflect the large number of cell divisions required for the progeny of a single cell to contribute a large proportion of hematopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The short telomeres of the GPI+ cells indicate that the residual hematopoiesis contributed by these cells is not <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This epigenetic change is an additional feature shared by <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
