<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patient was a female term infant (blood group B, Rh+ Coombs test positive) who received a one-unit group O, Rh- exchange transfusion from an unrelated female donor for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002904'>hyperbilirubinemia</z:hpo> due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0860218" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ABO incompatibility</z:e> on day 2 </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>With antithymocyte globulin and high dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="41879">dexamethasone</z:chebi>, the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GVH</z:e> reaction improved somewhat </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">Cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, 200 mg/kg total dose, was given over four days followed by a marrow graft from a brother who was HLA-A, B identical, and probably also D locus compatible in mixed lymphocyte culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GVH</z:e> resolved with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> treatment and hematologic reconstitution was evident by 14 days after transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two weeks later the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">GVH</z:e> reaction and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> recurred and Y chromatin was detected in only 6% of marrow cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The infant died on day 80 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Autopsy showed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153252" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">disseminated candidiasis</z:e>, disseminated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010823" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cytomegalovirus infection</z:e>, thymic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151773" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoplastic marrow</z:e>, and other histopathologic changes consistent with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">GVH disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The persistence of female cells in blood and bone marrow and the destruction of the reconstituted marrow suggest that the original incompatible transfusion-derived graft was not eliminated and that it ultimately rejected the histocompatible marrow graft </plain></SENT>
