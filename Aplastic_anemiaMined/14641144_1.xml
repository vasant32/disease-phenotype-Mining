<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA), interferon-gamma produced by stromal cells has more influence on the pathogenesis of marrow failure than interferon-gamma produced by lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We evaluated the expression of cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules, such as very late antigen-4 (CD49d), and -5 (CD49e) or c-kit receptor (CD117), by CD34-positive bone marrow cells in patients with AA who achieved hematological complete remission after immunosuppressive therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Before treatment, CD34-positive cells showed markedly higher expression of CD49d and CD49e than cells from healthy controls, indicating the strong <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> of stem cells to the bone marrow stroma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Expression of CD49d and CD49e was significantly decreased, reaching <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels, after hematological recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that changes in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule expression by stem cells are important in the pathology of AA </plain></SENT>
