<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>30 (21%) were found positive for <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> B surface antigen (HBsAg) in serum either before or after BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Their serologic profile and clinical outcome are described </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nine out of 30 patients were HBsAg positive before BMT: four were <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> carriers and five were found HBsAg+ at transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three of the former and one of the five latter patients remained persistently HBsAg+ after transplant with signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">liver disease</z:e>; none developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001399'>liver failure</z:hpo>, indicating that HBsAg positivity is not an absolute contra-indication to BMT </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>HBsAg was detected early (n = 12) or late (n = 9) after transplant </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Several HBV-infected patients were constantly seronegative for antibody to HBcAg even in the presence of active HBV replication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results show that the serologic pattern of HBV markers in BMT patients is unpredictable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>HBV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> was rarely associated with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> and HBsAg carriage </plain></SENT>
