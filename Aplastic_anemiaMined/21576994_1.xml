<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Of the total 24 patients included in the study, 12 were male and 12 female with a median age of 44 years (range 16-72) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nine patients received Lymphoglobulin®, 7 Thymoglobulin® and ATG-Fresenius® (ATG-F) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference between the three treatment groups in terms of severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The estimated 6-month survival rates for ATG-F, Lymphoglobulin and Thymoglobulin groups were 42.9, 77.8 and 71.4%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The difference in overall survival rates between groups was not significant, most likely due to the low number of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The most striking result was that none of the patients in the ATG-F preparation group showed any response to treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The ATG-F group was found to have a significantly inferior response rate (p = 0.07) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our data showed that none of the patients responded to ATG-F treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Hence, despite the small number of the patients, we recommend that ATG-F should not be used for treatment of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
