<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We previously reported on 26 patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> who were studied using the lymphocyte-mediated cytotoxicity (LMC) and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) assays </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Eighty-one additional patients have now been studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Overall, lymphocytes of 47% of the patients in LMC and sera of 30% in ADCC were reactive against the lymphocytes of HLA-identical siblings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>LMC reactivity was more frequent in patients studied less than 1 month after diagnosis, but the frequency of ADCC reactivity was unrelated to time after diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In patients receiving the basic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (CY) regimen, LMC results correlated with rejection in patients receiving transplants greater than or equal to 1 month after diagnosis but not in patients receiving transplants less than 1 month after diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Reactivity in ADCC correlated with graft rejection regardless of the time between diagnosis and study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No correlation between results of either assay and graft outcome was found in patients who received conditioning regimens aimed at abrogating rejection including total body irradiation or addition of donor buffy coat cells to the marrow inoculum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The finding of reactivity in the LMC assay early after diagnosis and in 8 or 15 untransfused patients indicates that mechanisms in addition to transfusion-induced sensitization must be involved in LMC reactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This LMC reactivity may be an epiphenomenon secondary to the stem cell defect of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Alternatively, this LMC reactivity may be involved in the etiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
