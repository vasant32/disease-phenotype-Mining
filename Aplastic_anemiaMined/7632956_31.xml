<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>CD52 is a phosphatidylinositolglycan (PIG)-anchored <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> (PIG-AP) expressed on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> T and B lymphocytes, monocytes, and the majority of B-cell non-Hodgkin <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We observed the emergence of CD52- T cells in 3 patients after intravenous treatment with the humanized anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody Campath-1H for refractory B-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> and could identify the underlaying mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition to the absence of CD52, the PIG-AP CD48 and CD59 were not detectable on the CD52- T cells in 2 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PIG-AP-deficient T-cell clones from both patients were established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Analysis of the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> of the PIG-A gene showed an abnormal size in the T-cell clones from 1 of these patients, suggesting that a mutation in the PIG-A gene was the cause of the expression defect of PIG-AP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An escape from an immune attack directed against PIG-AP+ hematopoiesis has been hypothesized as the cause of the occurrence of PIG-AP-deficient cells in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004818'>paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results support the hypothesis that an attack against the PIG-AP CD52 might lead to the expansion of a PIG-anchor-deficient cell population with the phenotypic and molecular characteristics of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> cells </plain></SENT>
