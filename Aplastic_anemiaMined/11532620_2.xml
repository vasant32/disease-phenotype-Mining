<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Although acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> is usually a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> disorder, a small proportion of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> was reported to recover spontaneously without specific therapy such as allogeneic bone marrow transplantation or immunosuppressive treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We attempted to determine the rate of spontaneous remission in the patients with AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of adult patients (n=136) who were diagnosed as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> at the Asan Medical Center from 1990 to 2000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The hematologic criteria of spontaneous remission were defined according to the proposed remission criteria of the SAA Working Party of the EBMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eighteen (13%) of 136 patients satisfied the criteria for spontaneous remission at median 14 days (range, 4-332) from the diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In fifteen (83%) of 18 patients, spontaneous remission occurred within 50 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Spontaneous remission was complete in fourteen patients (78%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only two patients relapsed at 208 and 1,857 days after spontaneous remission, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that presence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> at diagnosis (p = 0.017), drug as an etiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (p = 0.028), and serum albumin level less than 3.4 g/dL (p = 0.005) were independent predictive factors for spontaneous remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirmed that a minority of patients with AA recovered spontaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Spontaneous remission was rapid and complete in most patients, and relapses were rarely observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In most cases with spontaneous remission, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> might be associated with external factors such as drug or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
