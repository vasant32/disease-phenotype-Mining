<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fourteen (31.8%) patients achieved complete response and 17 (38.6%) achieved partial response, for an overall response rate of 70.4% after 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seven non-responders received bone marrow transplantation from an HLA-matched unrelated donor and 6 out of 7 are alive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The probability of overall survival at 10 years was 88.3+/-4.9%, which supports the role of IST with ATG and CsA as treatment of choice for children with HAA without an HLA identical sibling donor </plain></SENT>
