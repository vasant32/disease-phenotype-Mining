<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These regulatory cells (monocytes--macrophages, lymphocytes) modulate almost every phase of the erythropoietic process, and along with erythropoietin represent the major controlling force in erythropoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Evidence indicate that pathological alterations of these cell-mediated activities can lead to clinical disturbances of red cell production such as is seen in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1260899" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BDS">Diamond-Blackfan syndrome</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
