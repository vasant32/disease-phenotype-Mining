<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We analyzed the outcome of 100 patients with acquired severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> undergoing an alternative donor transplant, after immune suppressive therapy had failed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: As a conditioning regimen, patients received either a combination of fludarabine, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, and antithymocyte globulin (n=52, median age 13 years) or this combination with the addition of low dose (2 Gy) total body irradiation (n=48, median age 27 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 1665 and 765 days, the actuarial 5-year survival was 73% for the group that received fludarabine, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, and antithymocyte globulin and 79% for the group given the conditioning regimen including total body irradiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> grade III-IV was seen in 18% and 7% of the groups, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Graft failure was seen in 17 patients with an overall cumulative incidence of 17% in patients receiving conditioning with or without total body irradiation: 9 of these 17 patients survive in the long-term </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The most significant predictor of survival was the interval between diagnosis and transplantation, with 5-year survival rates of 87% and 55% for patients grafted within 2 years of diagnosis and more than 2 years after diagnosis, respectively (P=0.0004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Major causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> were graft failure (n=7), post-transplant-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024314" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lymphoproliferative-disease</z:e> (n=4) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (n=4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms positive results of alternative donor transplants in patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, the best outcomes being achieved in patients grafted within 2 years of diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Prevention of rejection and Epstein-Barr virus reactivation may further improve these results </plain></SENT>
