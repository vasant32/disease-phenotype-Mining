<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A homogeneous Ep preparation was labeled with 125 I by the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53767">chloramine-T</z:chebi> method to a specific activity of 90 to 136 micro Ci/microgram and immunoreactivity of 80% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ep antiserum, which was produced to a human urinary Ep preparation (80 U/mg of protein), was adsorbed with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human urinary and serum proteins without any loss in sensitivity of the RIA to increase the specificity of the assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A good correlation was seen between the RIA and the exhypoxic polycythemic mouse assay (corr. coef </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>0.967; slope 1.05 and "y" intercept 0.75) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ep titers in sera from 175 hematologically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human subjects exhibited a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> frequency distribution and ranged between 5.8 and 36.6 mU/ml with a mean of 14.9 +/- 4.7 (S.D.) and median of 14.3 Serum Ep titers were markedly elevated in seven patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and one patient with pure red cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> (1350 to 20,640 mU/ml) and were lower than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in two patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001901'>polycythemia</z:hpo> vera (8.1 and 9.4 mU/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The serum Ep titers in a prenephrectomy patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0000099'>glomerulonephritis</z:hpo> (32.1 mU/ml) decreased to below <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> levels (9.04 mU/ml) after nephrectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cord serum erythropoietin titers in 10 IDM [90.82 +/- 134.1 (S.D.) mu/ml] returned to values within the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range (13.86 +/- 5.55) on day 3 after birth, suggesting the utility of the RIA in elucidating the role of <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> and/or insulin in increased erythropoiesis in IDM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The serum Ep titers in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemias</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001901'>polycythemias</z:hpo> were compared to those of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human subjects and agreed well with pathophysiologic mechanisms of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemopoietic disorders</z:e>, confirming the validity of the RIA </plain></SENT>
