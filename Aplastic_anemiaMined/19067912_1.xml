<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In different transplant centers, the reasons leading to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30480">FHF</z:chebi> differ significantly as well as outcome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report our single center experience with 30 pediatric patients receiving a liver transplant for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30480">FHF</z:chebi>, out of a total of 83 children presenting with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30480">FHF </z:chebi></plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The time to transfer patients to the transplant center after the diagnosis of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30480">FHF</z:chebi> was long, with a median of 14 days (Ltx group) and 12 days (controls), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In nearly half of the patients (n = 14) in the Ltx group, we were not able to establish an exact diagnosis prior to Ltx: 50% suffered from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo>, and 13 patients were treated in the intensive care unit prior to transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Because of the availability of different surgical techniques, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> children received a timely transplant [split (n = 18), living donor (n = 9), whole organ (n = 2), and reduced liver (n = 1)] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patient survival was 93.4%, and graft survival was 83.4% for at least one yr follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Severe complications following Ltx included three cases with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and one child suffering from systemic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001427'>mitochondrial</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The survival of patients treated medically was 83% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that a strong focus should be made on early referral to a specialized center and on improvement of diagnostic tools to timely detect the underlying reason for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30480">FHF </z:chebi></plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Results following Ltx for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30480">FHF</z:chebi> are good </plain></SENT>
