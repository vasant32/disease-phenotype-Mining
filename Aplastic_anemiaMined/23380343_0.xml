<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients with acquired SAA received a total of 15 HHCTs with in vitro CD3-depleted grafts between July 2009 and July 2012 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among the 12 patients, 11 achieved neutrophil engraftment at a median of 10 days (range, 9 to 13 days) after HHCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One patient failed to achieve primary engraftment, and two experienced graft rejection soon after engraftment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> three patients who experienced early graft failure received a second HHCT and achieved sustained engraftment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thus, the final engraftment rate was 100% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> was assessed in 9 patients, excluding the 3 patients with early graft failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three of these patients developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (two ≥ grade II and one with grade III) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 12 patients survived and were transfusion-independent at a median follow-up of 14.3 months (range, 4.1 to 40.7 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from haploidentical family donors with in vitro CD3 T cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> is a reasonable therapeutic option for children and adolescents with acquired SAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Our future trial with a uniform protocol will help to solve the problems associated with HHCT and provide a valuable platform for the further development of HHCT as a therapy for SAA </plain></SENT>
