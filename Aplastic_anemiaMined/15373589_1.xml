<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Granulocyte concentrates contain approximately 30 mL of RBCs and it has been necessary to give D(-) recipients granulocyte transfusions from D(+) donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Intravenous RhIG has not yet been demonstrated to be effective in preventing D <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948201" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">alloimmunization</z:e> with granulocyte transfusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Four D(-) recipients received multiple D(+) granulocyte transfusions from D(+) donors and multiple injections of intravenous RhIG at a standard dose of 600 microg for each D(+) transfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two D(-) males with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0740451" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">granulomatous disease</z:e> were given 32 and 13 daily granulocyte transfusions, 18 and 2 of which, respectively, were D(+) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After the first dose of intravenous RhIG, both patients exhibited circulating anti-D that was undetectable 3 to 4 years later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> were given 5 and 14 granulocyte transfusions, 4 and 7 of which, respectively, were D(+) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Both patients died before the effectiveness of RhIG could be assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In one of these patients the indirect and direct antiglobulin tests became positive after the first dose of intravenous RhIG, which required that subsequent granulocyte transfusions from D(+) donors be crossmatched by immediate spin (IS) testing only </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A delayed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0235575" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemolytic reaction</z:e> attributed to allo-anti-K occurred after granulocytes from a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29103">K(+)</z:chebi> donor were given to this patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that intravenous RhIG can be used to prevent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948201" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">alloimmunization</z:e> to D in D(-) patients receiving large quantities of RBCs from D(+) granulocyte transfusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>However, anti-D and other passive antibodies from RhIG prohibit the use of the antiglobulin crossmatch with antigen-positive granulocyte donor samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It may be important to frequently collect new samples to screen for newly formed allo-antibodies when IS crossmatches are used in place of the antiglobulin crossmatch </plain></SENT>
