<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thereby otherwise inappreciable changes in HbF production can readily be recognized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>F reticulocyte frequencies are reporducibly measurable whenever the product of whole blood HbF-bearing red cell (F cell) frequency and reticulocyte frequency is approximately 5 X 10(-4) or greater </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serial analyses of F reticulocytes and nonreticulocyte F cells (F erythrocytes) illustrate that (1) levels of F reticulocytes and F erythrocytes are persistently similar in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> adults with more than 6% F cells and thus cell survival times of F and non-F cells must be essentially the same, (2) changing levels of F reticulocytes can be sensitive predictors of later changes in mature F cell frequencies during infancy and in adults recovering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, and (3) alterations in F reticulocyte frequency and the amount of HbF per F reticulocyte are discordant in some settings but concordant in others </plain></SENT>
