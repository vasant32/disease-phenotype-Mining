<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Factors involved in the suppression of bone marrow could be the same as those causing <z:hpo ids='HP_0001399'>hepatic failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We considered parvovirus B19 a candidate etiologic agent because of the known tropism of B19 for erythroid precursors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Archived liver and serum from six patients undergoing liver transplantation for non-A, non-B, non-C FLF with associated AA were analyzed for the presence of B19 DNA and anti-B19 serology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An age- and gender-matched control group (N = 44) was analyzed in parallel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>B19 DNA studies and anti-B19 serology were performed in a blinded fashion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>B19 serologies were performed by antibody capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>B19 DNA was detected after polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of target B19 DNA sequences in liver and serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Liver tissue showed evidence of B19 DNA in four of six (66%) patients with FLF and associated AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Two of 4 patients with cryptogenic FLF but without AA had B19 DNA detected in the liver tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Of the 34 remaining controls, only 5 (15%) showed evidence of B19 DNA in liver tissue (66% vs. 15%, P = .016) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>B19 DNA was not detected in any of the test or control sera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This study provides evidence to support the role of parvovirus B19 in the development of FLF and associated AA </plain></SENT>
