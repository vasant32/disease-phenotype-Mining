<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty five AA children treated with r-ATG [3.5 mg/(kg·d)×5 days] combined with CsA were analyzed retrospectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The lymphocyte subgroups, CD4(+)/CD8 ratio and expression of CD55, CD59 on surface of neutrophils and erythrocytes in peripheral blood were detected by direct immunofluorescence method and flow cytometry; the responsive time, effective rate, adverse effects and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> after immunosuppressive therapy (IST) were analyzed; the distribution of T-lymphocyte subgroups in IST-effective and IST-unefective groups was compared, and therapeutic efficacy-related factors were evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the response to treatments was found in 21 out of 25 cases, the total responsive rate was 84.0%; the response time was 3 - 6 months, average of 4 months; the effective rates in month 3, 6, 9, 12 after treatment were 56.0%, 72.0%, 80.0% and 84.0% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The AA children with age ≥ 5 years old, course of disease &lt; 6 months and absolute neutrophil value ≥ 1.5 ×10(9)/L on 30 days after IST had good curative effect; the effective rate in AA children with age ≥ 5 years old, course of disease &lt; 6 months, high or reverse ratio of CD4(+)/CD8(+) and absolute neutrophil value ≥ 1.5×10(9)/L after IST was higher than that in AA children with age &lt; 5 yeaars old, conrse of disease ≥ 6 months, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ratio of CD4(+)/CD8(+) and absolute neutrophil value after IST &lt; 1.5×10(9)/L (94.4% vs 57.1%, 90.4% vs 50.0%, 94.1% vs 62.5%, 94.1% vs 62.5%) (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The high effective rate was observed in AA children with decrease of CD55 and CD59 expression, but there was no significant difference (P &gt; 0.05) as compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> expression of CD55, CD59 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the treatment using r-ATG (3.5 mg/kg·d × 5 d) combined with CsA is a safe and effective for children with AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Age, course of disease and absolute neutrophil value on 30 days after IST are the main factors affecting curative affect </plain></SENT>
