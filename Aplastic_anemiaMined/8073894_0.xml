<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These patients, for whom a diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> had previously been confirmed, suddenly developed profound or <z:mp ids='MP_0001967'>complete hearing loss</z:mp> accompanied by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000360'>tinnitus</z:hpo> and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002321'>vertigo</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition to <z:mp ids='MP_0002875'>erythrocytopenia</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, serial hematological examinations revealed a marked drop in the platelet count prior to or just at the time of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> episode of hearing loss </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The prognosis for hearing recovery was poor in each patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that intracochlear <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> could be a mechanism underlying the sudden <z:mp ids='MP_0004740'>sensorineural hearing loss</z:mp> in these patients </plain></SENT>
