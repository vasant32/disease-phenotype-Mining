<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0002938'>white-spotting</z:mp> (Ws) locus of rats represents a 12-base deletion of the c-kit receptor tyrosine kinase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Homozygous Ws/Ws rats are deficient in melanocytes, mast cells, and erythrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although mice possessing two mutant alleles at the c-kit (W) locus, such as mice of W/Wv genotype, show severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> even in adult age, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> of Ws/Ws rats remarkably ameliorated with age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We investigated the mechanism of the age-dependent amelioration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow cells of Ws/Ws rats did not form macroscopic colonies in the spleen of irradiated rats, and the concentration of burst-forming unit-erythroid in the marrow of Ws/Ws rats was comparable with that of +/+ rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the increase in morphologically identifiable erythroid precursors in the marrow of Ws/Ws rats was attributed to the increased concentration of colony-forming unit-erythroid (CFU-E) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the increase in CFU-E appeared to result from the increased concentration of erythropoietin (EPO) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Because injections of relatively low doses of EPO cured the slight <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> that remained in adult Ws/Ws rats, CFU-E and/or its immediate precursors of Ws/Ws rats appeared to be more sensitive to EPO than those of W/Wv mice, in which a huge dose of EPO was necessary to cure the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
