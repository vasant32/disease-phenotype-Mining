<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="9588">Ticlopidine</z:chebi> is associated with a relatively high incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0000334'>agranulocytosis</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have shown that other drugs associated with <z:mp ids='MP_0000334'>agranulocytosis</z:mp> are metabolized to reactive metabolites by activated human neutrophils or by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24757">HOCl</z:chebi>, which is the major oxidant produced by activated neutrophils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We set out to test the hypothesis that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9588">ticlopidine</z:chebi> also fits this pattern and is oxidized to a reactive intermediate by activated neutrophils and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24757">HOCl</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>As much as 8% <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9588">ticlopidine</z:chebi> was metabolized by activated human neutrophils to a dehydro-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="9588">ticlopidine</z:chebi>; however, this product did not account for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the decrease in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9588">ticlopidine</z:chebi> concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The oxidation products of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9588">ticlopidine</z:chebi> by the combination of myeloperoxidase and <z:chebi fb="17" ids="16240">hydrogen peroxide</z:chebi> were the same as those by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24757">HOCl</z:chebi>: dehydrogenated <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9588">ticlopidine</z:chebi> and 2-chloroticlopidine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A neutrophil-derived reactive metabolite of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9588">ticlopidine</z:chebi> was trapped with GSH and the same <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9588">ticlopidine</z:chebi>-GSH conjugate was found in both the myeloperoxidase and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24757">HOCl</z:chebi> systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Evidence for the identity of the reactive metabolite was obtained by reaction of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9588">ticlopidine</z:chebi> with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24757">HOCl</z:chebi> in a flow reaction system coupled to a mass spectrometer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mass spectra suggested that the reactive metabolite was a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30856">thiophene</z:chebi>-S-<z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9588">ticlopidine</z:chebi> follows the same pattern of reactive metabolite formation by activated neutrophils as other drugs associated with a high incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0000334'>agranulocytosis</z:mp>, and the putative <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30856">thiophene</z:chebi>-S-<z:chebi fb="76" ids="17996">chloride</z:chebi> formed by activated neutrophils may be responsible for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9588">ticlopidine</z:chebi>-induced <z:mp ids='MP_0000334'>agranulocytosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
