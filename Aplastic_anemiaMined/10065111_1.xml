<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (SAA) is a disease associated with high mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For young patients with HLA identical siblings, allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) offers the best chance of cure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Favourable results have also been reported using immunosuppressive therapy (IST) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transplantation is usually favoured for patients below 45 years of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We report our experience of 11 allogeneic and one syngeneic BMT for adult Chinese patients with SAA, over a 4-year period from 1991 to 1995 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ten of the 12 (83 per cent) patients had received and failed prior IST including anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) before being referred for BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neutrophil and platelet engraftment was successful in 11 of them (92 per cent) and nine were completely transfusion independent after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Their overall 3-year survival was 67 per cent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The compromised overall result was due to a number of cases transplanted after a long time delay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No patient transplanted beyond 3 years from the initial time of diagnosis of SAA achieved long-term marrow engraftment, and they <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> eventually succumbed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>On univariate analysis, a longer time delay and hence a larger amount of blood products exposure, were highly significantly statistically associated with inferior marrow engraftment and patient survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Other factors including age, iron status, infused cell dose and the conditioning protocol were not found to significantly affect engraftment and survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">Graft versus host disease</z:e> was clinically mild or absent in most patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This may be related to ethnicity or previous ATG exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, early allogeneic BMT was a safe and effective treatment in our small series of patients with SAA failing IST </plain></SENT>
