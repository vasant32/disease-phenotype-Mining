<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In order to investigate the molecular mechanisms participated in the process of marrow failure, we created an in vitro model of hematopoietic cell suppression, by continuous addition of TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma in an vitro long-term bone marrow culture system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An up-regulation of Fas expression was observed in CD34+ cells in cytokine treated cultures, compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This was accompanied by significant TRAIL and decreased caspase 3 mRNA expression, whereas the expression of Bcl-2 family members was low (Bcl-xl) or absent (Bcl-2, Bax) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expression of these apoptotic genes was also investigated in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Apart from Fas <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression in total marrow and/or CD34+ cells, TRAIL <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression was found only in CD34+ cells in active disease while in total marrow cell compartment this remains a constant finding even in patients in remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The above data are in agreement with previous studies proposing a major role for the extrinsic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> pathway in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and additionally introduce TRAIL as a probable important molecule in the process </plain></SENT>
