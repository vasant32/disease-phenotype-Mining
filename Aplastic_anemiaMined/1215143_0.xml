<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Thirty-six patients with different types of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> have been studied by double scintigraphy, with 99mTc-colloids and 111In.-transferrin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The observed results are compared to those obtained by bone marrow biopsy and ferro-kinetic studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Despite our imperfect knowledge of the <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp> of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30430">indium</z:chebi>, and the non-selectivity of this tracer for the erythropoietic line, the good correlation observed in most cases between scintigraphy with 111In. and ferro-kinetics and bone marrow histology is an argument which favours the clinical use of this tracer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A striking difference between the results of scintigraphy with Tc-colloids and scintigraphy with 111In. was noticed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0877221" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">erythroblastopenias</z:e>, and in most of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemias</z:hpo>, primitive or due to partial leukemic involvement of the bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that this double study may have an interest for the prognosis in these cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>, treated by radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy, In. and Tc scintigraphies show an extension of active bone marrow to normally inactive zones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It indicates a severe defect of the normally active zones, and appears to be a contra-indication for any supplementary chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_173'>myeloid metaplasias</z:mpath>, this study may be useful for the choice of treatment, by giving precise indications on the degree of splenic erythropoiesis and of bone marrow cellular <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
