<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients who survived for 4 mo or less after the first clinic visit (group A) were different from the patients who survived longer (group B) with respect to their modes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo>, sex, intervals from the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms to first clinic visit, and initial hematologic values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These differences suggested that short survival could be predicted from data available at the first contact with the physician </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>From these measurements, a prognostic index could be calculated which was useful in identifying the patients in group A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although this method of prognostication needs further testing, if validated, it may prove useful in selecting patients for therapeutic trials and could explain the divergent results in previous studies of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi> treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When our <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi>-treated subjects were compared with subjects with a similar prognostic index who had not received <z:chebi fb="5" ids="50113">androgens</z:chebi>, a beneficial effect of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi> therapy on survival could not be demonstrated </plain></SENT>
