<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively analyzed the impact of older age on transplantation outcomes and survival in a total of 225 adult patients with AA who underwent allo-HSCT: 57 patients &gt;40 years old (older patient group [OPG]) and 168 patients ≤40 years old (younger patient group [YPG]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Age at allo-HSCT ≤40 years, time from diagnosis to allo-HSCT ≤6 months, and matched related donor (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRD</z:e>) were favorable prognostic factors in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> study patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Risk analysis of survival in the OPG showed that age &gt;50 years was the only poor prognostic factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Survival did not differ significantly between the YPG and patients &lt;50 years old in the OPG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, patients between the ages of 41 and 50 years with severe AA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MRDs</z:e> should undergo allo-HSCT as early as possible to optimize survival </plain></SENT>
