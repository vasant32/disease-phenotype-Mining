<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 61 year old woman was admitted to our hospital suffering from severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> revealed marked <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> with 24.8% plasma cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There was a small amount of IgA type M protein in serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>Multiple myeloma</z:hpo> was ruled out on the basis that 1) the amount of serum IgA-M protein was minimal and no increase was observed, 2) no indication of monoclonality of bone marrow plasma cells was shown by immunofluorescent staining of immunoglobulins, 3) neither <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0238792" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bone lesion</z:e> nor other symptoms related to <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Therefore, a diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> was made, and bolus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi> therapy (1,000 mg/day x 3 days) was performed, which brought the patient to complete remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>An oral dose of 15 mg of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> is administered daily now and the remission state is being maintained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Bolus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi> therapy is performed quite often for the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, there are few reports in which remission was reached with the use of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="24261">glucocorticoids</z:chebi> alone, most having used <z:chebi fb="5" ids="50113">androgens</z:chebi> or other supportive drugs in conjunction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Here, we will discuss this case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> which responded to repeated bolus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi> therapy, with minimal side effects, and discuss its effectiveness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> associated with idiopathic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1136085" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">monoclonal gammopathy</z:e> is not reported, so this case is interesting immunologically </plain></SENT>
