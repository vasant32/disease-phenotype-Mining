<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the studies reported here was to determine whether the observed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> of bone marrow (BM) cellularity in mice administered <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> was reflected in a suppression of development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the hematopoietic lineages and to confirm the ability of interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1 alpha) to prevent BZ-induced BM cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report that BZ, administered twice per day for 2 days to C57B1/6J mice at a dose of 600 mg/kg body weight, caused a significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> of the total number of nucleated BM cells per femur when measured on day 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The observed <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> reflects a complex situation that represents the net effect of a decrease in the total number of cells of the lymphocytic and erythroid lineages, along with an increase in the number of intermediate and terminally differentiated cells of the granulocytic lineage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An experiment to monitor the effects of BZ over a 7-day period showed a progressive depressive effect on the lymphocytes and an initial <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> of the erythroid cells at day 3 that remained constant until day 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Conversely, the numbers of intermediate and terminally differentiated granulocytes progressively increased over the 7 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The BM appeared to recover from the depressive effects of BZ immediately upon cessation of exposure, as the number of nucleated BM cells began to rise by day 5 and was equal to that of the control group by day 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results expand our earlier finding (Renz and Kalf 1991) that the overall <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> of BM cellularity occurs because of an inability of the stromal fibroblast to produce colony-stimulating factors essential for stem and progenitor cell survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This results from inhibition by the BZ metabolite, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17594">hydroquinone</z:chebi> (HQ), of the processing of pre-IL-1 alpha to the mature cytokine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
