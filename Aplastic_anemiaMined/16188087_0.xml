<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To detect the differential expression of cell signal transduction genes associated with <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> poisoning, and to explore the pathogenic mechanisms of blood system damage induced by <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Peripheral white blood cell gene expression profile of 7 benzene poisoning patients, including one <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, was determined by cDNA microarray </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seven chips from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> workers were served as controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cluster analysis of gene expression profile was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among the 4265 target genes, 176 genes associated with cell signal transduction were differentially expressed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>35 up-regulated genes including PTPRC, STAT4, IFITM1 etc were found in at least 6 pieces of microarray; 45 down-regulated genes including ARHB, PPP3CB, CDC37 etc were found in at least 5 pieces of microarray </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: cDNA microarray technology is an effective technique for screening the differentially expressed genes of cell signal transduction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Disorder in cell signal transduction may play certain role in the pathogenic mechanism of <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> poisoning </plain></SENT>
