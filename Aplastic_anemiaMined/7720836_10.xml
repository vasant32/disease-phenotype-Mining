<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We described a fully automated measurement of reticulated platelets using a <z:chebi fb="2" ids="51121">fluorescent dye</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="51874">auramine</z:chebi> O, and a reticulocyte counter, the R-3000, equipped with special software </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Reproducibility and linearity were shown to be good </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects studied (n = 60), the mean value for reticulated platelets was 0.98% +/- 0.41% and the mean absolute count was 2.12 +/- 0.69 x 10(9)/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The absolute count for reticulated platelets was significantly lower (p &lt; 0.05) in patients with reduced thrombopoiesis as seen in <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloblastic leukemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> or chemotherapy-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> and it was elevated (p &lt; 0.05) in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0040028" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">essential thrombocythemia</z:e> and in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myelocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001894'>thrombocytosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 20 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001973'>idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura</z:hpo> had a high percentage of reticulated platelets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The percentage of reticulated platelets was significantly increased (p &lt; 0.05) in patients with impaired thrombopoiesis despite the reduction in the absolute count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 2 leukemic patients, an apparent rise was noticed in the percentage of reticulated platelets which preceded by several days a progressive increase in the platelet count at the recovery phase of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that an automated measurement of reticulated platelets can be applied to routine laboratories for clinical use </plain></SENT>
