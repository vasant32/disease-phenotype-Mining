<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 1995 and 2006, 20 SAA patients received TLI for conditioning of HSCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients were multi-transfused or had long duration of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Fifteen (75%) patients had graft failure from prior HSCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 18 (90%) patients, the donors were human leukocyte antigen identical siblings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The stem cell source was the peripheral blood stem cell in 15 (75%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The conditioning regimen was composed of antithymocyte globulin plus TLI with a median dose of 750 cGy in 1 fraction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) prophylaxis used <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 10.8 years, graft failures developed in 6 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among them, 3 patients received their third HSCT to be engrafted finally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The Kaplan-Meier overall survival rate was 85.0% and 83.1% at 5 and 10 years, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD was 20% and 20%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>None of the patients have developed a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> after HSCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In our study, TLI based conditioning in allogeneic HSCT was feasible with acceptable rates of GVHD in SAA patients who experienced graft failure from prior HSCT or was at a high risk of graft rejection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>We achieved relatively better results of engraftment and survival with a long term follow-up </plain></SENT>
