<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>IgM were found out in 37.9% cases (2.8 times higher than in donors), low-avide IgG--in 44.8%. "early" proteins CMV--29.9% and DNA--in 36.8% cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Concerning the DNA presence, preference was given to research of leucocytic suspension compared with blood serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of 28 children of 3-13 y.o. with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> being seropositive in CMV, IgG antibodies were detected in 13 children while IgM antibodies to Parvovirus B19 were found in 10 children </plain></SENT>
