<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Some evidence has shown that platelet crossmatching is useful in multitransfused patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>hypoplastic bone marrows</z:hpo> who are refractory to platelet therapy through <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948201" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">alloimmunization</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several immunoglobulin binding assays other than enzyme-linked immunospecific assay (ELISA) have been studied previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed 51 ELISA crossmatches on six patients receiving single donor platelets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One bone marrow transplant patient receiving 33 single donor HLA matched (related and unrelated) was also studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Effectiveness of transfusion was closely monitored by patient evaluation and corrected platelet count increment (CCI) at 1-2 and 18-24 hours posttransfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We found the ELISA method very sensitive, specific, and predictive, 85, 96, and 95.6% respectively in the 51 crossmatches studied in six patients with either <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, variation existed among individual recipients, with sensitivity ranging from 70-100% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The distribution of true positives and negatives and false positives and negatives in the 33 crossmatches performed in the bone marrow transplant patient differed significantly (chi 2 = 101.2; P less than 0.001) from single donor recipients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The specificity in the 51 crossmatches on the six patients was also significantly different from the 33 crossmatches performed in the bone marrow transplant (96 vs 74%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This suggests individual variation occurs as well as differences in diseases and bone marrow suppressive agents affecting platelet crossmatching </plain></SENT>
