<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In a retrospective study, factors influencing the eventual course and outcome of patients suffering from aplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of the 62 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> concomitant with an aplastic or <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>hypoplastic bone marrow</z:hpo>, 36 have died during the first 24 months following diagnosis, 27 of these 36 cases within the first six months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>26 patients survived more than two years after presentation, but a further six of these cases succumbed during the following months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the 62 cases, 46 had neutrophil counts under 1 X 10(9)/l and platelet counts under 20 X 10(9)/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These cases were subdivided according to their reticulocyte levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the age group of patients between 10 and 35 years, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> those patients having more than 10,000/mul reticulocytes survived more than two years with only one exception, whereas only one of the 11 patients having reticulocyte counts below 10,000/mul has survived </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In our series, the initial neutrophil and platelet counts were not of predictive value in identifying poor prognosis patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The initial reticulocyte counts, however, appear to be a valid parameter for selecting patients in two groups, one with a favorable, and the other with an extremely unfavorable prognosis on conservative treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Young individuals with a poor predicted prognosis could thus be defined as possible candidates for bone marrow transplantation </plain></SENT>
