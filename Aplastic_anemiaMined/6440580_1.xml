<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of these patients, 665 were HBsAg+, 427 HBsAg-, 31 with IgM anti-HAV, 26 non A and non B <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>21 patients were not classified due to lack of data relating to markers for HAV or HBV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>Anemia</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023530" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">leucopenia</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> were found with some frequency at the haemochromocytometric examination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is emphasized that these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850715" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">haematological abnormalities</z:e> are often of minor relevance whereas the rarer and more serious complications such as persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow hypoplasia</z:hpo> or pure <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> can present difficult clinical problems regarding prognosis and therapy: in 4 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow hypoplasia</z:hpo> a recovery was obtained in 1 case only, whereas the remaining cases had a fatal outcome after a period varying from 20 days to 15 months from the appearance of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We suggest the advisability of a closer study of the haematological and immunological aspects in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006562'>viral hepatitis</z:hpo> in order to discover those elements which are useful towards a better understanding of the etiopathogenesis of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850715" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">haematological abnormalities</z:e> studied above </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Such a detailed study would also enable further improvement in existing therapeutic measures </plain></SENT>
