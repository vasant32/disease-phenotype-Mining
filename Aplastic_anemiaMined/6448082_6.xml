<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have studied peripheral blood lymphocytes of 117 patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and 237 healthy individuals for reactivity against autologous lymphocytes and/or lymphocytes from HLA-identical siblings using a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50076">51Cr</z:chebi> release assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Lymphocytes from 29% of the patients exhibited reactivity against their own lymphocytes, while only 3% of lymphocytes from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals showed such reactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Lymphocytes from 49% of the patients showed reactivity against lymphocytes from their HLA-identical siblings compared to 4% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Correlation existed between allogeneic and autologous reactivities (p &lt; 0.001), suggesting a common pathway for cytotoxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both reactivities showed an association with extremely low granulocyte counts (p &lt; 0.01) and an inability of the patient's mononulcear cells to stimulate in allogeneic mixed leukocyte culture (p &lt; 0.05) as well as an inverse correlation with time from diagnosis (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At least two explanations exist for the transfusion-independent autologous and allogeneic cytotoxicities: (1) they could be epiphenomena secondary to the stem cell defect, such as the loss of a cell that suppresses (or regulates) naturally occurring cytotoxic cells, or (2) they may be involved in the cause of the disease </plain></SENT>
