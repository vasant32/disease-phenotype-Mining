<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The conditioning regimens: 20 patients received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (CY) + anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) + fludarabine (Flu), 21 received CY + ATG + Flu+ <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28680">cytarabine</z:chebi> (Ara-C) ± <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi> (Bu)/melphalan (Mel) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The median number of infused CD34(+) cells were 3.48 (2.39 - 4.80)×10(6)/kg in allo-BMT and 2.95 (1.27 - 5.98)×10(6)/kg in allo-PBSCT, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Hematopoietic reconstitution was observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 41 patients (100%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The median time of neutrophils (ANC) reached to 0.5×10(9)/L and platelets (PLT) reached to 20×10(9)/L were 14 (10 - 23) days and 19 (8 - 38) days, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>12 patients developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD (aGVHD), out of which 11 developed grade I-II aGVHD, and one developed grade IV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>2 patients occurred <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD (cGVHD), out of which one with local cGVHD and the other with extensive </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>5 patients (12.2%) died, out of which one died of extensive cGVHD, and 4 died of invasive <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026946" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fungal infections</z:e> (IFI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Median follow-up time was 23 (3 - 79) months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>36 patients survived </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>5-year estimated overall survival (OS), disease free survival (DFS), and transplant-related mortality (TRM) was (81.1 ± 9.0)%, (68.4 ± 11.0)%, and (18.9 ± 9.0)%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>Univariate analysis showed that lover OS had significant correlation with receiving PBSCT, occurrence of aGVHD, the number of infused CD34(+) cells no more than 2.5×10(6)/kg, the number of red blood cell (RBC) transfusion before transplant more than 30 U and occurrence of IFI after transplantation (P = 0.034, 0.001, 0.006, 0.000, 0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>Occurrence of aGVHD had significant correlation with the disparity between donor and recipient ABO blood groups, the number of PLT transfusion more than 100 U, and the number of RBC transfusion more than 30 U before transplantation, the number of infused CD34(+) cells no more than 2.5× 10(6)/kg (P = 0.019, 0.038, 0.005, 0.005, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>The occurrence of GR had significant correlation with the number of PLT transfusion more than 100 U before transplantation (P = 0.038) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MSD</z:e> allo-HSCT is an effective therapy for patients with SAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Lower number of blood transfusion before transplantation, use of BMT, more number of infused CD34(+) cells can effectively prevent and treat aGVHD and IFI after transplantation, which may improve the efficacy of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MSD</z:e> allo-HSCT for SAA </plain></SENT>
