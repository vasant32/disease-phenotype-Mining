<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have found that By114 is a sensitive indicator for recognizing patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> and has helped delineate a group of nine patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and a negative Ham's test who have evidence of a larger <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> clone than indicated by other monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By114 is a valuable marker for detecting the emergence of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> clone before the Ham's test becomes positive and is a more sensitive detector of deficient GPI-anchored proteins than other mAbs </plain></SENT>
