<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>By using transferrin-bound receptor for the preparation of the immunologic reagents, we developed an assay that gives an identical dose-response curve with either free or transferrin-bound receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mean concentration of circulating receptor in 82 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> male and female volunteers was 5.63 +/- 1.42 mg/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The level was reduced significantly in patients with primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and post-transplant <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> (2.58 +/- 1.07 mg/L and 2.32 +/- 0.48 mg/L, respectively) and was sharply elevated in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001878'>hemolytic anemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001891'>iron deficiency anemia</z:hpo> (33.1 +/- 17 and 18.0 +/- 11.4 mg/L, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our assay values are approximately 20-fold higher than results published previously in a study that used an immunoradiometric assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The disparity apparently relates to a difference in sensitivity of the latter assay for free and transferrin-bound receptor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Measurements of serum transferrin receptor provide a useful clinical index of either total or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0240066" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron-deficiency</z:e> erythropoiesis </plain></SENT>
