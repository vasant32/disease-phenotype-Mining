<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigate alterations in the hematopoietic microenvironment in AA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We present the results of studying mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC), fibroblastic colony-forming units (CFU-F), and adherent cell layers (ACL) of long-term bone marrow cultures (LTBMC) from bone marrow (BM) samples of AA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MSC of AA patients proliferated longer than those of donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In half of the patients' MSC cultures, adipogenesis was impaired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Osteogenic differentiation was not achieved in 36% of AA MSC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CFU-F formed enlarged colonies, and their concentration in the BM of AA patients was significantly increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that the physiological activation of the stromal microenvironment is characteristic of AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We detected a decrease in the expression of the angiopoetin-1 (ANG-1) and vascular cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecule-1 (VCAM-1) genes, together with an increase in the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in ACL of AA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This indicates abnormal regulatory patterns in both osteoblastic and vascular contexts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Addition of AA patients' serum to donors' LTBMC for 3 weeks induced similar gene expression alterations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The addition of parathyroid hormone (PTH) resulted in the expression levels of analyzed genes returning to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, in both AA LTBMC and donor cultures treated with AA serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The physiologic status of the BM stromal microenvironment (MSC, CFU-F, and ACL of LTBMC) of AA patients was altered </plain></SENT>
