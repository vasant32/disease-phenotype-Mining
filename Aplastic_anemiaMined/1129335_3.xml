<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Serum unsaturated <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17439">vitamin B12</z:chebi>-binding capacity (UBBC) has been shown to fluctuate with neutrophil levels and has been reported to correlate with TBGP in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and hyperleukocytic states </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the present report demonstrates that the above relationship is not present in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo>, suggesting that some of our concepts regarding UBBC may have to be reexamined, since factors other than TBGP appear to be operative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There was a wide scatter of UBBC values among the 39 neutropenic subjects studied, the mean being significantly above <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were few low values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>High UBBC was primarily confined to subjects with transient <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> values were generally seen in steady <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The difference in UBBC was primarily due to Transcobalamin I, the other serum binders being similar in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No other significant diagnostic pattern of UBBC was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Recovery from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> was accompanied by a rise in UBBC in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases except in four patients whose UBBC was initially very high and fell with recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No discernible pattern of serum <z:chebi fb="13" ids="33611">B12</z:chebi> levels existed, although subnormal levels without evidence of <z:chebi fb="13" ids="33611">B12</z:chebi> deficiency were found in three of the seven patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Serum <z:chebi fb="13" ids="33611">B12</z:chebi> levels did not change with recovery in approximately half of the neutropenic subjects, change being variable in the others </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Neither serum <z:chebi fb="13" ids="33611">B12</z:chebi>, UBBC, total <z:chebi fb="13" ids="33611">B12</z:chebi>-binding capacity, or any of the three serum <z:chebi fb="13" ids="33611">B12</z:chebi> binders correlated with neutrophil count, bone marrow findings, TBGP, or granulocyte turnover rate </plain></SENT>
