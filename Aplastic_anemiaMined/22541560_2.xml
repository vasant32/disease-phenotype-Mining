<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>While most cases are simplex and idiopathic, some show a clear pattern of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000005'>inheritance</z:hpo>; therefore, elucidating the underlying genetic cause could lead to a greater understanding of this spectrum of disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used a combination of exome sequencing and SNP haplotype analysis to identify causative mutations in a family with a history of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal-dominant</z:hpo> AA/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We identified a heterozygous mutation in SRP72, a component of the signal recognition particle (SRP) that is responsible for the translocation of nascent membrane-bound and excreted proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A subsequent screen revealed another <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal-dominant</z:hpo> family with an inherited heterozygous SRP72 mutation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Transfection of these sequences into mammalian cells suggested that these proteins localize incorrectly within the cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, coimmunoprecipitation of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitope</z:chebi>-tagged SRP72 indicated that the essential <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> component of the SRP did not fully associate with one of the SRP72 variants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that inherited mutations in a component of the SRP have a role in the pathophysiology of AA/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, identifying a third pathway for developing these disorders alongside transcription factor and telomerase mutations </plain></SENT>
