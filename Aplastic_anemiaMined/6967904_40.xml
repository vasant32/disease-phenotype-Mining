<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Colony formation was depressed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients (less than 5% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Further studies showed that 1) patients' colony formation could be enhanced by removing T cells from the marrow, but not by removing adherent cells (AC); 2) patients' marrow cells showed a marked CFU-c inhibition against <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> allogeneic marrow; 3) CFU-c/suppression could be reduced by removing T cells from the patients' marrow before the co-culture experiments; 4) patients' marrow T cells showed significant CFU-c/inhibition against autologous as well as against allogeneic unrelated <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> marrow cells; 5) irradiation with 1500 rads of T cells abrogated their suppressor activity; 6) the latter was found mainly in marrow T cells with IgG receptors (TG+ cells) as well as in the supernatant of marrow T cells cultured overnight; 7) TG+ cells derived from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> donors had no significant CFU-c/inhibitory activity against autologous or allogeneic marrow cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Active <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0854467" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">myelosuppression</z:e> would thus be detectable in patients with SAA in remission and would appear to be mediated by marrow T cells with IgG receptors </plain></SENT>
