<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They were conditioned for grafting with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, 50 mg/kg body weight on each of 4 successive days </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five of the 30 are alive between 9 to 84 (median, 19.5) months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The actuarial projection of survival for 2 to 6 years is 75% </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These data show that early transplantation should be carried out before transfusions are given for any patient with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> who has an HLA-identical family member </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>If sensitization to minor transplantation antigens contained in blood products is avoided, the incidence of marrow-graft rejection will decrease, and survival will improve </plain></SENT>
