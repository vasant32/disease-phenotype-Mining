<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report the long-term follow up of patients who underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from an HLA-matched sibling donor after this conditioning regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: We analyzed 61 consecutive patients transplanted from June 1991 to February 2010, following conditioning with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (200 mg/kg) and antithymocyte globulin (2.5 mg/kg/day Ã— 5 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Median age was 21 years (range 4-43); 41 of the 61 patients were adults </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Median duration of the disease before hematopoietic stem cell transplantation was 93 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> but 2 patients received bone marrow as the source of stem cells and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but 2 engrafted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cumulative incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> grade II-IV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> was 23% (95%CI 13-34) and 18 developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (cumulative incidence 32% at 72 months, 95% CI 20-46) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, a higher number of infused CD3 cells was associated with an increased risk of developing <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (P = 0.017) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>With a median follow up of 73 months (range 8-233), the estimated 6-year overall survival was 87% (95% CI 78-97) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At 72 months, the cumulative incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0010885'>avascular necrosis</z:hpo> was 21% and 12 patients presented with <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> dysfunction (cumulative incidence of 19%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Only one patient developed a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0751623" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">secondary malignancy</z:e> (Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo>) during follow up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">Cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> and antithymocyte globulin is an effective conditioning regimen for patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and is associated with low treatment-related mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Long-term complications include <z:hpo ids='HP_0010885'>avascular necrosis</z:hpo> and <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> dysfunction </plain></SENT>
