<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We examined the effect of ALG on human megakaryocyte progenitor cells (colony-forming unit-megakaryocyte, CFU-Meg) in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> human bone marrow mononuclear cells (MNC) were cultured in plasma clots with varying concentrations of ALG or non-immunized horse IgG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After 12 days of culture, significant megakaryocyte colony formation was observed in cultures containing ALG but not in cultures containing non-immunized horse IgG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The peak stimulatory effect seemed to occur with 10-25 micrograms/ml of ALG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When marrow MNC, depleted of adherent and T cells, were cultured in plasma clots with ALG, its stimulatory effect on megakaryocytopoiesis decreased markedly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, it was demonstrated that ALG stimulated marrow MNC to produce a factor stimulatory for CFU-Meg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The in vitro megakaryocytopoietic stimulatory effect of ALG may be related to its clinical efficacy in some patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
