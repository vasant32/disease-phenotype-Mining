<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This cytokine proved to be an effective hematopoietic growth factor with only mild side effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The rhIL-3 treatment led to increased overall bone marrow cellularity with trilinear stimulation of hematopoietic cells, except in most patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001880'>eosinophilia</z:hpo> and, in some instances, bone marrow <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition to the increase in the number of circulating neutrophilic granulocytes, platelets, and reticulocytes, an increase of peripheral blood monocytes and lymphocytes was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The histologic and cytologic findings support the concept that rhIL-3 stimulates the proliferation and differentiation of pluripotent hematopoietic progenitor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It appears to be a safe and efficient therapeutic modality in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Additional clinical studies are needed to determine which patients will profit most from rhIL-3 treatment </plain></SENT>
