<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Based on the concern that this may lead to later neuropsychologic impairment in children, a longitudinal study was conducted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty pediatric bone marrow transplant recipients, treated for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> or severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (SAA), and their sibling donors, were given a neuropsychological examination in 1986 and 1988 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A third follow-up study of patients treated before 12 years of age was undertaken in 1990-91 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We present longitudinal data on patients treated with BMT when 3-11 (n = 15) and 12-17 (n = 11) years old </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No neuropsychological deficits were found in the older group, or among non-irradiated SAA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the first follow-up, children treated with BMT, including TBI at 3-11 years of age, performed less well than donors on tasks involving perceptual and fine-motor speed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the second follow-up, this group of patients also demonstrated a slight deficit in non-verbal problem solving </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An additional relative decline in verbal reasoning was noted in the third follow-up, 5.5-10 years after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Alertness to signs of developmental difficulties in children treated with BMT, including TBI, is recommended </plain></SENT>
