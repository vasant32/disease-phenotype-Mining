<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> AA patients, diagnosed and treated in one clinic in 1998-2005, were included in the trial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In severe and very severe AA (SAA/VSAA) the patients (n = 19) received combined immunosuppressive therapy (IST) with antithymocytic globulin (ATG) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> (CsA), in non-severe AA (NSAA) the patients (n = 9) were given monotherapy with CsA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Allogenic transplantation of bone marrow (alloTBM) was made in 4 young patients with SAA/VSAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The diagnosis of AA was established in 33 patients (19 males and 14 females): NSAA in 9, SAA in 19, VSAA in 5, idiopathic--in 26, posthepatic--in 5, associated with pregnancy--in 2 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Age median was 20 years (13-53) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The clone of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004818'>paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>) was identified in 7 of 33 patients (21%), antigen HLA-DRB1 *15 in 6 of 11 patients (55%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In median of 26-month follow-up 31 patients (94%) were alive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In IST, complete or partial remissions were obtained in 88% patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Median of the interval to achievement of transfusion independence made up 2.5 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients after alloTBM are in complete remission, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> extensive transplant against host reaction was observed in one case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Introduction of updated protocols provides long-term survival of more than 80% AA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>To optimize treatment outcomes, it is necessary to include newly diagnosed AA patients into ongoing multicenter studies </plain></SENT>
