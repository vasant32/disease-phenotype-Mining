<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Blood cell levels (granulocytes, monocytes, erythrocytes, lymphocytes, and platelets) were assessed and fitted to a flexible polynomial spline model, thus defining the (a) initial suppressive and (b) subsequent recovery phases for the subgroups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Results showed that relative to the overall magnitude of blood cell loss as well as to the maximum rate of suppression during the initial phase, the subgroups were generally ranked -S-AA much greater than +R-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MPD</z:e> greater than +R-nonMPD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Relative to the overall strength of the recovery response, the subgroups were generally ranked +R-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MPD</z:e> greater than +R-nonMPD much much greater than -S-AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In terms of overall maintenance levels of circulating blood cells during the recovery phase, however, the +R-nonMPD subgroup consistently exhibited stronger responses than the +R-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MPD</z:e> subgroup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results tend to support our contention that selected subgroups of dogs have strong propensities to specific hematopathologies (i.e. <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>) under <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> irradiation and that these pathology-prone animals exhibit a series of marked differential hematopoietic responses during early preclinical phases, which serve effectively to prognosticate subsequent pathological progression </plain></SENT>
