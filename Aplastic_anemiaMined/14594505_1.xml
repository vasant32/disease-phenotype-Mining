<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previously, we and others have shown that fetal liver infusion (FLI) leads to autologous hematopoietic improvement in 40-54% of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, whether this recovery was spontaneous or the effect of the infused liver cells was not clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To dissect the role of FLI in autologous hematopoietic recovery, the colony-supporting potential of fetal liver-conditioned medium (FLCM) was evaluated in bone marrow (BM) cells of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> adult and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In both cases, each sample of FLCM supported the growth of colony-forming cells in semi solid culture medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The FLCM was assayed for the presence of four principal colony-stimulating cytokines, namely stem cell factor (SCF), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin-3 (IL-3), and erythropoietin (Epo) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>While GM-CSF, IL-3, and Epo were present in insignificant amounts or were altogether absent, 50-635 pg/ml of SCF was found in 8 of the 13 FLCM samples tested </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Preliminary results of bioneutralization assay indicated the possible role of SCF, secreted by the FL cells, in colony-supporting activity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> BM cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall, our in vitro study implicates the paracrine role of infused FL cells in regenerating autologous hematopoiesis in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
