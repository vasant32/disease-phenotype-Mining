<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Antilymphocyte globulin/antithymocyte globulin (ALG/ATG) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> A (CsA) (sequential intensified immunosuppressive therapy, SIIST), with or without hematopoietic growth factors (HGFs) were administered to 73 SAA patients in a prospective randomized clinical trial to test the effectiveness of the addition of HGFs for the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The response rate of SIIST with HGFs group was significantly higher than that of SIIST alone group (89.2% vs 63.9%), with lower rates of early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> (24.3% vs 55.3%) and mortality (4.0% vs 16.7%), shorter duration of cytopenia and blood transfusion dependence and faster recovery of bone marrow hematopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The addition of HGFs to SIIST was tolerated well in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in the treatment outcome of the two groups with GM-CSF plus Epo or G-CSF plus Epo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The use of HGFs in combination with SIIST could reduce early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and mortality rates and, therefore, improve the response rates in SAA patients </plain></SENT>
