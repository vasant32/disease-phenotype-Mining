<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Previous studies have demonstrated the defective <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSCs</z:chebi> and aberrant T cellular-immunity in AA using a microarray approach </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, little is known about the overall specialty of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we comprehensively compared the biological features and gene expression profile of BM-MSCs between AA patients and healthy volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In comparison with healthy controls, BM-MSCs from AA patients showed aberrant <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, decreased proliferation and clonogenic potential and <z:mp ids='MP_0006042'>increased apoptosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>BM-MSCs from AA patients were susceptible to be induced to differentiate into adipocytes but more difficult to differentiate into osteoblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Consistent with abnormal biological features, a large number of genes implicated in cell cycle, cell division, proliferation, chemotaxis and hematopoietic cell lineage showed markedly decreased expression in BM-MSCs from AA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conversely, more related genes with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, adipogenesis and immune response showed increased expression in BM-MSCs from AA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The gene expression profile of BM-MSCs further confirmed the abnormal biological properties and provided significant evidence for the possible mechanism of the destruction of the bone marrow microenvironment in AA </plain></SENT>
