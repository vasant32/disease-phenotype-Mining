<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One of the hallmark phenotypes of FA is cellular hypersensitivity to agents that induce DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs), such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27504">mitomycin C</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="172" ids="27504">MMC</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>FA is caused by mutation in at least 14 genes which function in the resolution of ICLs during replication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The FA proteins act within the context of a protein network in coordination with multiple repair factors that function in distinct pathways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SNM1B/Apollo is a member of metallo-β-lactamase/βCASP family of nucleases and has been demonstrated to function in ICL repair </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the relationship between SNM1B and the FA protein network is not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the current study, we establish that SNM1B functions epistatically to the central FA factor, FANCD2, in cellular survival after ICL damage and homology-directed repair of DNA double-strand breaks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We also demonstrate that <z:chebi fb="172" ids="27504">MMC</z:chebi>-induced chromosomal anomalies are increased in SNM1B-depleted cells, and this phenotype is not further exacerbated upon <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of either FANCD2 or another key FA protein, FANCI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, we find that SNM1B is required for proper localization of critical repair factors, including FANCD2, BRCA1 and RAD51, to <z:chebi fb="172" ids="27504">MMC</z:chebi>-induced subnuclear foci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our findings demonstrate that SNM1B functions within the FA pathway during the repair of ICL damage </plain></SENT>
