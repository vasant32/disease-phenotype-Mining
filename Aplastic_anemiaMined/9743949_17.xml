<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In contrast to bone marrow transplantation (BMT), however, patients after IST are not considered cured as high rates of relapse and development of clonal disease demonstrate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>From 11/93 to 9/97 114 children (65 m, 49 f; median age 9.5 y.) from 37 centers in Germany and Austria were registered in the SAA 94 study </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At d 112 61% of evaluable patients became independent of transfusions (IST response: CR + PR), 13% with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> blood counts (CR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>After 6 months 33% showed CR </plain></SENT>
