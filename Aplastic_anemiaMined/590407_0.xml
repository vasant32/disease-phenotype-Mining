<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This conclusion applied both when the cells were exposed to oxymetholone prior to culturing with erythropoietin and when the steroid was present in the cultures simultaneously with erythropoietin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Unlike those steroids having a direct effect on erythroid cells, oxymetholone also failed to increase the proportion of erythropoietin responsive cells in DNA synthesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The relevance of these observations to the therapeutic benefit of oxymetholone is discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>While the possibility that oxymetholone has to be metabolized to an active form cannot be excluded, the results suggest that oxymetholone does not seem to be erythropoietically active by a direct effect on erythroid cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The fact that it is a successful therapeutic agent in some patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> may be due to its proven ability to increase endogenous erythropoietin levels or to reduce <z:hpo ids='HP_0010972'>ineffective erythropoiesis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
