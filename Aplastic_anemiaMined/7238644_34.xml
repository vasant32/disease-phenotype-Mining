<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>From January 1972 to July 1974, 28 patients with bone marrow <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35610">cytostatic</z:chebi> treatment, were transfused with packed cells and platelet concentrates, both containing 10-20% of the amount of leukocytes present in whole blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of these patients, 26 (93%) became refractory to random platelets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Since July 1974, 68 patients have been given red cells filtered through cotton-wool, a procedure which removes over 97% of the leukocytes, and leukocyte-poor platelet suspensions obtained by an additional centrifugation step </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of this latter group, 16 patients (24%) became refractory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fifty-two recipients were non-refractory to random platelet transfusions after an exposure time of at least 6 weeks and maximally 32 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A possible explanation is that platelets are less immunogenic than leukocytes; on the other hand platelets may not be immunogenic at <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> with regard to induction of HLA antibodies, and the occurrence of the immunization is purely the result of the contamination with leukocytes in the red cell and platelet preparations </plain></SENT>
