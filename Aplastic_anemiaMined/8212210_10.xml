<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Despite vigorous hydration and frequent voiding in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients receiving <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, 135/977 (15% by Kaplan-Meier projection) developed HC (micro- or gross <z:hpo ids='HP_0000790'>hematuria</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100518'>dysuria</z:hpo>, bladder pain) between -11 and +100 days (median +22) after BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of these, 60 had severe HC, including major <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0178879,C1561646" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">urinary obstruction</z:e> (4/60), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal failure</z:hpo> (13/60), or need for surgical or chemical bladder cauterization (16/60) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>By univariate analysis, allogeneic BMT recipients had more frequent HC than autologous patients (17% vs. 9%, P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, allogeneic patients with adenoviruria were at increased risk for the development of HC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> conditioned with high dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> and total lymphoid irradiation had the highest rate of HC (22%) versus those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> (15%, P = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to further identify those factors independently associated with HC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> regression models, the factor most highly associated with the development of HC was the finding of adenovirus in the urine preceding the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000790'>hematuria</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>HC-related morbidity, and its associated increased hospitalization costs, frequently complicates BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Improved prophylactic measures, perhaps including the use of 2-mercaptoethane <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33543">sulfonate</z:chebi>, are needed, at least for allogeneic BMT patients with their attendant risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001486" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">adenovirus infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
