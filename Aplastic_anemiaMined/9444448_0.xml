<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> underwent long-term administration (10 weeks) of recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF) in doses from 50 to 800 micrograms/m2 per day by intravenous infusion or 50 to 100 micrograms/m2 per day by subcutaneous injection and re-combinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO) in doses ranging from 2000 to 8000 IU/m2 per day by intravenous injection three times a week for at least 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The goal was to evaluate whether therapy ameliorated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> in these patients as well as to determine its safety </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> assessable patients showed a substantial increase in absolute neutrophil count, with a recovery of myeloid components (granulocyte series) in the bone marrow, after 2 to 10 weeks of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An increase &gt; 1.5 g/dL in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (Hb) concentration was observed in 2 patients (10%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A decrease &gt; 50% in red cell transfusion requirement was observed in 2 patients (10%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Seven patients showed recovery of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, and platelet count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, there was no serious <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> before or during therapy, and side effects were mild </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of the 20 patients, 3 showed a dramatic improvement in severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> after 10 weeks of treatment accompanying a recovery of erythroid components in the bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>They no longer require red cell transfusions and have had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> Hb concentrations and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ferrokinetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that long-term administration of rhG-CSF and rhEPO may benefit some patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further studies will be necessary to elucidate the mechanism by which rhGCSF and rhEPO stimulate hematopoiesis and improve hematologic abnormalities in these patients </plain></SENT>
