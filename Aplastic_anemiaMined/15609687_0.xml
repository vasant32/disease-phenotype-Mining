<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 2002, she came to our hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The laboratory data revealed severe cytopenia according to the criteria by Camitta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A cytogenetic study revealed a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> female karyotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We demonstrated CD55-negative and CD59-negative clones in her erythrocytes and granulocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HLA-DR 1501 was negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> pulse therapy, the del(13q) (7/21 cells) was noted in her marrow cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>She was re-treated with ATG (rabbit serum), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> and G-CSF without particular cytogenetic changes after the therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Deletion of the 13q anomaly is rarely detected in patients with AA and its clinical significance in this disease is not well known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the literature, AA patients with the del(13q) responded well to immunosuppressive therapy, irrespective of the timing of the appearance of the del(13q) anomaly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further investigation will be needed to clarify the significance of del(13q) in AA </plain></SENT>
