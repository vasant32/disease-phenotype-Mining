<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We tried to prevent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948201" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">alloimmunization</z:e> in these patients by systematic use of leukocyte-free blood components with less than one million of contaminating leukocytes per unit of platelets or red cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our study group comprised 26 patients with a minimum of 10 platelet transfusions per patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These patients were compared with a historical reference group of 21 patients who had received standard blood products </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the leukocyte-free group none developed platelet refractoriness, in contrast to the reference group where 11 of the 21 patients became refractory to random platelets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median corrected platelet increment for random pooled platelets was significantly higher in the leukocyte-free group compared with the reference group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The increasing number of transfusions did not correlate with the development of platelet refractoriness; instead we propose that the lower limit of antigenic exposure is important </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that systematic use of leukocyte-free blood components effectively prevents development of platelet refractoriness and contributes to optimal supportive care of children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
