<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The pathogenetic mechanisms leading to marrow failure are diverse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The clinical finding, that most patients respond to immunosuppressive therapy implicates an immune pathophysiology of AAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On the other hand successful and long lasting reconstitution after allogeneic stem cell transplantation implicates, that a stem cell defect is a major pathogenetic factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We analyzed immunological and hematological parameters on 91 pediatric patients with AAA at time of diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We defined three distinct pathogenetic subgroups by analyzing the frequency of hematopoietic progenitors and the frequency of activated T-cells in patients bone marrow: type I: decreased percentage of hematopoietic progenitors; type II: increased percentage of activated T-cells; type III: increased percentage of pluripotent progenitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 51% of the AAA patients we found a relative decreased frequency of hematopoietic progenitors and 29% of the patients demonstrated an increased percentage of activated T-cells, 25% patients showed an increased percentage of pluripotent hematopoietic progenitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In order to characterize these distinct immunological subgroups, we investigated the plasma levels of IFN-gamma and IL15 as inhibitors and IL10 as stimulator of hematopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>IL15 plasma levels were significantly elevated in AAA patients when compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast we could not demonstrate a difference between IFN-gamma or IL10 plasma levels in AAA patients when compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>However for IL10 and IL15 we were able to define subgroups of patients with highly elevated plasma levels of the cytokines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that the immunopathogenesis of AAA can be <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneous</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>This <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> might reflect exposure to different exogenous agents or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> in intrinsic susceptibility </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The clinical impact of our findings needs to be assessed in long-term follow up of the patients </plain></SENT>
