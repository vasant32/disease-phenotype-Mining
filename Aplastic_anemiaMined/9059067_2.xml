<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Afterward the diagnosis was corrected to <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (RA) due to the reevaluation of the bone marrow smears </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In March, 1995, thirst and polyurea occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In April, 1995, bone marrow <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> biopsy showed the proliferation of atypical blasts (28%), and two months later, the number of the blasts increased (30%) and leukemic progression was noticed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Only 0.5 percent of the blasts showed weak peroxidase activity, and most of the blasts had CD13, CD33 and several <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001511" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Acquired Abnormality" abbrv="">adhesion</z:e> molecules as CD11a, CD11b, CD44, CD54 and CD56 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Karyotype of the bone marrow cells was 45, XX, -7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Her polyurea was caused by <z:hpo ids='HP_0000863'>central diabetes insipidus</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
