<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The greater the HLA disparity, the poorer the OS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>About 19 consecutive SAA/very SAA (VSAA) patients who received HSCT from haploidentical family donors in our center are reported in this study, 18/19 pairs had 2-3 loci mismatched </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 19 cases failed to respond to previous therapy and were heavily transfused before transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The conditioning regimen before HSCT included BU, CY and thymoglobulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The recipients received CsA, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="168396">mycophenolate</z:chebi> mofetil (MMF) and short-term MTX for GVHD prophylaxis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The source of stem cell grafts was a combination of G-CSF-primed BM and G-CSF-mobilized peripheral blood stem cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients achieved 100% donor myeloid engraftment; the median time for myeloid engraftment was 12 days (ranging from 10-29 days) and for platelets was 18 days (ranging from 8-180 days) with a cumulative platelet engraftment incidence of 84.21 ± 10.53% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The cumulative incidence was 42.1 ± 11.3% for grade II-IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD and 56.2 ± 12.4% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The OS was 64.6 ± 12.4% with a median 746-day (90-1970) follow-up for surviving patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These limited retrospective analysis data suggest that HLA-haploidentical HSCT for SAA patients without an HLA-identical sibling donor might be feasible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Further research to increase OS by decreasing GVHD while maintaining stable engraftment will be needed in the future </plain></SENT>
