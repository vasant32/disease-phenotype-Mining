<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among 43 women transplanted for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> following 200 mg/kg <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (CY), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 27 less than 26 years of age, but only five of 16 greater than 26 years of age recovered <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ovarian function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nine of the 43 have had 12 pregnancies, resulting in eight live births, and two elective and two <z:hpo ids='HP_0005268'>spontaneous abortions</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> eight children are <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nine of 144 women transplanted for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> following 120 mg/kg CY and 9.20 to 15.75 Gy total body irradiation (TBI) recovered ovarian function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two of these nine have had three pregnancies, resulting in two spontaneous and one elective abortion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The probability of having <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0747102" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ovarian failure</z:e> was 0.35 by 7 years for patients receiving CY alone and was 1.00 at 1 year for patients receiving CY plus TBI (P less than .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>By 7 years after transplant the probabilities of having <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ovarian function were 0.92 after CY alone and 0.24 after CY plus TBI (P less than .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed that TBI was the only factor significantly influencing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0747102" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ovarian failure</z:e> and that both TBI and greater patient age at transplant were significantly associated with a decreased probability of recovering <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ovarian function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data demonstrate that after high-dose CY, recovery of ovarian function occurs in younger women and in a minority of older women, but after CY and TBI, recovery occurs in only a few younger women and none of the older women </plain></SENT>
