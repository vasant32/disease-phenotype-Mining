<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The proband's stepbrother died of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0009315'>rectal adenocarcinoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The proband with progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> was studied in genetics and hematology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Family investigations suggest that the disorder was inherited as an <z:hpo ids='HP_0001417'>X-linked</z:hpo> recessive transmission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No specific chromosome aberrations were detected in both peripheral blood and bone marrow cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow biopsy revealed markedly <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151773" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypocellular marrow</z:e> without prominent reticulin fibers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hematopoiesis was assessed by assay of granulomonocytic (CFU-GM) colonies and clusters in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Numbers of CFU-GM were profoundly reduced in marrow cultures from our patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although a defect in the stromal microenvironment and lymphocyte mediated suppression could not be excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is possible that the defect is intrinsic to the hematopoietic stem cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277558" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">familial disease</z:e> described by this paper favors that the <z:mp ids='MP_0009563'>dyskeratosis</z:mp> congenita is <z:hpo ids='HP_0001417'>X-linked</z:hpo> with constitutional <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It is believed that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151773" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypocellular marrow</z:e> in DC is an inherited rather than an acquired condition </plain></SENT>
