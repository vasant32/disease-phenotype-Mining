<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied the effect of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17594">hydroquinone</z:chebi> (HQ), a toxic metabolite of <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> found in the bone marrow, on the human promyelocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> cell line (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60), which can be induced to differentiate to both monocyte and myeloid cells, and thus has been used as a surrogate for a granulocyte/macrophage progenitor cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Exposure of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60 cells to noncytotoxic concentrations of HQ for 3 hours before induction with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8116">phorbol</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30807">myristate</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="6" ids="15702,53394">TPA</z:chebi>) caused a dose-dependent inhibition of the acquisition of characteristics of monocytic differentiation, such as adherence, nonspecific esterase (NSE) activity, and phagocytosis, but had no effect on cell proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>HQ appeared to be affecting maturation beyond the monoblast/promonocyte stages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>HQ also prevented differentiation induced by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25-(OH)2D3]; however, the block occurred after the acquisition of adherence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>HQ at concentrations that inhibited monocytic differentiation had no effect on differentiation to granulocytes, suggesting that the block in the differentiation of these bipotential cells is a step unique to the monocytic pathway </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>HQ was unable to prevent differentiation induced by the macrophage-derived cytokine, interleukin (IL)-1, a differentiation factor for cells of the monocytic lineage </plain></SENT>
