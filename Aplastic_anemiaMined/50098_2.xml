<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 64-year-old woman with a syndrome of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100522'>thymoma</z:hpo>, severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0004313'>hypogammaglobulinemia</z:hpo>, seemingly <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cell-mediated immunity and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, was found to have virtually no immunoglobulin- (Ig) bearing peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, 7.8 +/- 3.4% of the PBL were positive for another B-cell marker, the receptor for aggregated IgG, while the remaining cells bound sheep erythrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Those cells which were aggregate-reactive appeared to be immature or incomplete B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cultures of peripheral blood leukocytes from the patient in various serum-containing media were studied by 3 independent technics for the development of lymphocyte surface Ig and for Ig in the culture supernatants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In vitro the patient's cells were able to develop surface Ig in media supplemented with fetal calf serum (FCS) or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> serum; in media supplemented with autologous serum, the cells developed no surface Ig </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>During the cultures in FCS, human Ig determinants became detectable in the medium, and both medium and cell-surface Ig underwent a shift from mu determinants early in the culture period to gamma and alpha determinants later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The development of Ig on the cells was not inhibited by the presence of autologous serum if FCS was included in the medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data support the concept that a factor, missing from this patient's serum, is required at an early stage in the maturation of the B cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001417'>X-linked</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0004432'>agammaglobulinemia</z:hpo> had a population of circulating lymphocytes with surface characteristics similar to the B cells of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0100522'>thymoma</z:hpo> case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, no Ig synthesis by this patient's cultured cells could be demonstrated, indicating a different level of block in the 2 cases despite their similarity at the level of the cell surface </plain></SENT>
