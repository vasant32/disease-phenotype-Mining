<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: <z:chebi fb="8" ids="35738">MAA</z:chebi> was defined as having a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151773" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypocellular bone marrow</z:e> and cytopenia in at least two cell lines not in the severe range </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twelve children met these criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-eight children with SAA were seen during the same interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="35738">MAA</z:chebi> were treated with immunomodulation with antithymocyte globulin and/or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> if they progressed to SAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Five patients with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="35738">MAA</z:chebi> progressed to SAA at a median interval of 18 months from diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The other seven patients required no therapy or only received transfusions for &lt; or = 6 months after diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The survival of the patients with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="35738">MAA</z:chebi> was significantly better than that of patients with SAA treated with immunomodulation (p = 0.022) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="35738">MAA</z:chebi> are alive at a median follow up of 7 years and are transfusion independent; only one patient currently receives therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Residual hematologic abnormalities in children with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="35738">MAA</z:chebi> included <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001882'>leukopenia</z:hpo>, and <z:mp ids='MP_0000248'>macrocytosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this small series of children with <z:chebi fb="8" ids="35738">MAA</z:chebi> the outcome was excellent and significantly better than in patients with SAA; more than half recovered with minimal or no therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Patients who progressed to SAA responded well to treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>A larger prospective study is needed to conclusively define the natural history of <z:chebi fb="8" ids="35738">MAA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
