<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The electrophoretic patterns of a series of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and pathological human sera and plasmas have been obtained using the schlieren scanning method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>From these patterns the mobilities and concentrations of the electrophoretically distinct protein components have been computed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The mobilities fall into five well defined groups corresponding to albumin, alpha, beta, and gamma globulins, and fibrinogen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The concentrations of the different components in pathological sera have been compared with those in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> sera, and the following tentative generalizations may be made </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The albumin/globulin ratios for pathological sera have been consistently lower than those for <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> sera </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The values of the alpha globulin/albumin ratio for the sera of the febrile patients studied were high, the average value being over twice the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The gamma globulin/albumin ratios for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and rheumatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> sera were also above <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Certain pathological conditions, notably <z:hpo ids='HP_0000100'>nephrosis</z:hpo>, were accompanied by large increases in a gamma globulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There is evidence that, in part at least, this consists of a labile lipo-protein </plain></SENT>
