<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>He was diagnosed with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> at 11-yr of age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>He had received continuous transfusions because an HLA-matched marrow donor was unavailable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Following a continuous, approximately 5-yr transfusion, he was noted to develop <z:mp ids='MP_0005638'>hemochromatosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>He had a <z:hpo ids='HP_0001644'>dilated cardiomyopathy</z:hpo> and required <z:chebi fb="40" ids="35498">diuretics</z:chebi> and digitalis, multiple <z:chebi fb="32" ids="24621">endocrine</z:chebi> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001410'>liver dysfunction</z:hpo>, generalized <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, and skin <z:hpo ids='HP_0001000'>pigmentation</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total volume of red blood cell transfusion before <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">deferoxamine</z:chebi> therapy was about 96,000 mL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>He received a regular iron chelation therapy (continuous intravenous infusion of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">deferoxamine</z:chebi>, 50 mg/kg/day for 5 days q 3-4 weeks) for approximately seven years after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of multiple organ failures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>His cytopenia and organ dysfunctions began to be gradually recovered since about 2002, following a 4-yr <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">deferoxamine</z:chebi> treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>He showed completely <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ranges of peripheral blood cell counts, heart size, and liver function two years ago </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>He has not received any transfusions for the last four years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This finding suggests that a continuous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">deferoxamine</z:chebi> infusion may play a role in the immune regulation in addition to iron chelation effect </plain></SENT>
