<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To detect <z:hpo ids='HP_0004818'>paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>) clone in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Flow cytometric technique along with antibodies against CD59 was used to estimate the amount of GPI-P deficient cells, characteristic of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 23 cases of AA studied, 13 possessed no excessive percentage of CD59(-) cells in peripheral PMNs and RBCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eight of these 13 cases underwent bone marrow examination, and no increase of CD59(-) mononuclear cell (MNC) was found either </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three other AA patients had slightly increased amount (&gt; 5%) of CD59(-) cells in both peripheral blood and bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In seven cases, percentages of CD59(-) cells were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in peripheral RBCs and PMNs but increased in bone marrow MNCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Measurement of CD59(-) cells in periperal blood and bone marrow by flow cytometry may serve as the best way of detecting <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> clone in AA, and thus could be used for the early diagnosis of AA-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> syndrome </plain></SENT>
