<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To explore the mechanism of integrated traditional Chinese and Western medicine (TCM-WM) therapy on <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (CAA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The RBC life span of 30 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human subjects and 30 patients with CAA were measured by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50076">51Cr</z:chebi> labelled technique before and after TCM-WM therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and distribution of RBC membrane protein granules were observed by freeze fracture etching and transmission electron microscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The half life of erythrocytes (RBC T1/2) was shortened in CAA cases and there was a significant difference compared to healthy control (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After therapy, the RBC life span prolonged and approached the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Before treatment, there existed abnormal in <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, decrease in amount and uneven in distribution of protein granules in protoplasmic face (PF) and extracellular face (EF) of RBC membrane </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After treatment, the protein granules of RBC membrane was improved and approached to control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp>, amount, quality and distribution of RBC membrane protein granule were closely related to its life span </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The therapeutic effect of TCM-WM was better than that of WM alone and it had a function both in stabilizing membrane protein and extending the RBC life span </plain></SENT>
