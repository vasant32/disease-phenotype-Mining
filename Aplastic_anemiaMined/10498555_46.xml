<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0004818'>Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</z:hpo> is frequently associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, although the basis of this relation is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To assess the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> status of patients with diverse marrow failure syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Correlation of cytofluorometric data with clinical features </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>SETTING: Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, Bethesda, Maryland </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS: 115 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, 39 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo>, 28 patients who had recently undergone bone marrow transplantation, 18 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> that was treated with chemotherapy, 13 patients with large granular <z:hpo ids='HP_0100827'>lymphocytosis</z:hpo>, 20 controls who had received renal allografts, and 21 healthy participants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>INTERVENTION: Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo>, or renal allografts received antithymocyte globulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>MEASUREMENTS: Flow cytometry was used to assess expression of GPI-anchored proteins on granulocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Evidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> was found in 25 of 115 (22%) patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>No patient with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> GPI-anchored protein expression at presentation developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> after therapy (n = 16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Nine of 39 (23%) patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> had GPI-anchored protein-deficient cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Abnormal cells were not detected in patients with constitutional or other forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> or in renal allograft recipients who had received antithymocyte globulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>Aplastic anemia</z:hpo> is known to respond to immunosuppressive therapy; in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo>, the presence of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> population was strongly correlated with hematologic improvement after administration of antithymocyte globulin (P = 0.0015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Flow cytometric analysis is superior to the Ham test and permits concomitant diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> in about 20% of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> (a rate similar to that seen in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The presence of GPI-anchored protein-deficient cells in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> predicts responsiveness to immunosuppressive therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Early emergence of GPI-anchored protein-deficient hematopoiesis in a patient with marrow failure may point to an underlying immune pathogenesis </plain></SENT>
