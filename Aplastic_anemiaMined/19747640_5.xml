<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We summarized results in 38 consecutive patients (median age=56 years) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> (n=35), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (n=2), or <z:hpo ids='HP_0005584'>renal cell carcinoma</z:hpo> (n=1), who underwent salvage hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) for allograft rejection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In 14 patients, the original donors were used for salvage HCT, and, in 24 cases, different donors were used </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Conditioning for salvage HCT consisted of fludarabine (Flu) and either 3 or 4 Gy total body irradiation (TBI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sustained engraftment was achieved in 33 patients (87%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Grafts were rejected in 5 patients (13%), 4 of whom had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011974'>myelofibrosis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>With a median follow-up of 2 years (range: 0.3 to 7.8 years), the 2- and 4-year estimated survivals were 49% and 42%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The 2-year relapse rate and nonrelapse mortality (NRM) were 36% and 24%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 2-year cumulative incidences of grades II-IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and moderate-severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (aGVHD, cGVHD) were 42% and 41%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In this cohort, TBI dose, grafts from original versus different donors, related versus unrelated donors, and HCT comorbidity scores did not have an impact on outcomes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We concluded that graft rejection after allogeneic HCT could be overcome by salvage transplantation using conditioning with Flu and low-dose TBI </plain></SENT>
