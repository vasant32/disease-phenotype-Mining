<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We here present two related XLP patients in different stages of disease that were both treated successfully with alloSCT using a matched unrelated donor </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Based on these results and in order to improve the final outcome, we conclude that alloSCT should be recommended in both symptomatic and asymptomatic XLP patients </plain></SENT>
