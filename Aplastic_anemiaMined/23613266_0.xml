<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As a result, many patients with benign BM failure that should be managed as AA are diagnosed as having <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, due to the absence of BM hypocellularity and the presence of dysplastic signs in the BM, and are treated inappropriately with toxic therapies, such as hypomethylating agents, and stem cell transplantation from unrelated donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>BM failure syndromes need to be managed in ways appropriate to their pathophysiology, which is more accurately determined by using markers such as the presence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24410">glycosylphosphatidylinositol</z:chebi>-anchored protein-deficient cells and HLA-A lacking leukocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We recently found that plasma thromobopoietin level is one of the most useful markers for distinguishing benign and pre-leukemic BM failure syndromes </plain></SENT>
