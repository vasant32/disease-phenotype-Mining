<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This pathological prion protein is very resistant to conventional inactivation methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The risk of transmission of TSE, such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022336" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease</z:e> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022336" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">CJD</z:e>), by biopharmaceutical products prepared from human cells must be taken into account </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The nanofiltration process has been proved to be effective in removing viruses and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036457" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="rida">scrapie</z:e> agent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The major advantages of this technique are flexibility and efficacy in removing infectious particles without altering biopharmaceutical characteristics and properties </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This study focused on the removal of human PrP(sc) by means of a nanofiltration method after spiking a Lymphoglobuline solution with a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022336" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">CJD</z:e> brain homogenate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Lymphoglobuline equine anti-human thymocyte immunoglobulin is a selective <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressive agent</z:chebi> acting mainly on human T lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The therapeutic indications are: immunosuppression for transplantation: prevention and treatment of graft rejection; treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In our study, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022336" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">CJD</z:e> homogenate was spiked at three different dilutions (low, moderate and high) in the Lymphoglobuline product </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The nanofiltration process was performed on each sample </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Using the western blot technique, the PrP(res) signal detected in nanofiltrates was compared to that obtained with a reference scale (dilution series of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022336" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">CJD</z:e> brain homogenate in Lymphoglobuline detected by western blot and elaborated on 3.3 log) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>After nanofiltration, the PrP(res) western blot signal was detected with a significant reduction in the less dilute sample, whereas the signal was undetectable in the two other samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These are the first data in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022336" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">CJD</z:e> demonstrating a clearance between 1.6 and 3.3 log with a Lymphoglobuline recovery of over 93% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The nanofiltration process confirms its relative efficacy in removing human <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022336" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">CJD</z:e> PrP(sc) </plain></SENT>
