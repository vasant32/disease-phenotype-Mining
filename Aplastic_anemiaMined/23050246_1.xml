<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> is subjected to wide variation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Most cases are acquired and immune-mediated but there are also inherited forms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>AIM: The study was conducted to assess the magnitude of the problem, morphological changes and determinants of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> in North Bengal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study had been conducted for a period of one year among 5 to 70 years age group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Initially complete blood count followed by bone marrow examination was done for diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Out of 48 cases, 38 (79.17%) had hypocellular diagnosed as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, 5 (10.42%) each had normocellular and hypercellular bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Histopathology shows that 30 (78.95%) cases had increased iron stores in bone marrow and 8 (21.05%) cases had decreased iron stores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Subjects less than 20 years of age mostly (31.58%) suffered from non-severe disease in contrast to subjects in higher age groups who had severe or very severe disease, though the trend was not significantly different (Ï‡(2) for linear trend 0.171, P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The study shows <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> is a common <z:hpo ids='HP_0001871'>hematological abnormality</z:hpo> among peripheral <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> in North Bengal region where males were affected more than females </plain></SENT>
