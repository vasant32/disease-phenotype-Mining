<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>Aplastic anemia</z:hpo> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> is a well characterized clinical entity, and clinical <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> is also prevalent in the Far East </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We performed a prospective case-control study to determine risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> in Bangkok and two rural regions during 1989 to 1994 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 375 cases were identified, along with 1,174 hospital controls matched for age and sex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Historical data were collected by trained interviewers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sera from a subset of cases (N = 177) and controls (N = 183) were tested for antibodies to <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> viruses A, B, and C and <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> B surface antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no evidence of association of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> B or <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Previous exposure to <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> A, as determined by immunoglobulin G (IgG) seropositivity, was significantly associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>: the relative risk adjusted for confounding was 2.9 (95% confidence interval 1.2-6.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The same association also existed for persons under age 25 years, in whom the prevalence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> A IgG was lower than in the total population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, no patients showed evidence of recent <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> A (immunoglobulin M [IgM] seropositivity) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that exposure to a <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> virus is a risk indicator for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> in Thailand, and while itself unlikely to be etiologic, <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> A may be a surrogate marker for another enteric microbial agent </plain></SENT>
