<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The endothelium seems to be actively involved in such processes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Over a period of 2 years we evaluated various hemostatic factors, associated or not with endothelial stimulation, in 44 patients with BMT (40 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> and 4 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemias</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Factor VIII activity (VIII:C), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042974" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">von Willebrand</z:e> factor antigen (vWF:Ag), tissue plasminogen activator antigen (tPA), plasminogen activator inhibitor activity (PAI-1), antithrombin III, protein C and protein S were assayed before and 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Factor VIII:C, vWF and tPA were found to be significantly increased 1-6 months after BMT, returning to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft versus host disease</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> or cyclosporin treatment had significantly higher VIII:C, vWF and tPA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The increase in these factors implies lasting stimulation of their release and/or synthesis from endothelial cells that is enhanced by some complications of BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The degree and character of these changes could favor activation of thrombotic processes </plain></SENT>
