<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have assessed the effectiveness of infusing large numbers of highly purified haploidentical CD34+ cells after immunoablative conditioning in three patients who had failed intensive immunosuppression, lacked unrelated donors, and had active or recent serious <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>One patient rejected the first infusion, but engrafted after a second infusion from the same donor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This patient died 4 months after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation with no evidence of lymphoid reconstitution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two patients experienced mixed chimerism requiring treatment with antibodies and/or donor lymphocyte infusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Both currently survive more than 1 year after transplantation with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> blood counts, 100% donor engraftment, effective lymphoid reconstitution, and no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We observed functional thymopoiesis as measured by lymphocyte immunophenotyping, T cell receptor excision circles and T cell receptor Vbeta spectratyping complexity analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further study is required to validate the initial promise of these preliminary observations </plain></SENT>
