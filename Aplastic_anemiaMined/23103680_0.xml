<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OS and EFS at 10 years were as high as 89.7+/-1.7% and 85.5+/-2.0%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Five cases of late <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> (LM) were identified (<z:hpo ids='HP_0100697'>malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002890'>thyroid carcinoma</z:hpo>, colon <z:mp ids='MP_0002038'>carcinoma</z:mp>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002884'>hepatoblastoma</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cumulative incidence of LM was 0.8% at 10 years and 2.5% at 20 years, respectively, which was lower than that in previous reports </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This low incidence is in keeping with the low occurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0007114" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">skin cancer</z:e> in Japanese population and of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD in our study group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Radiation-containing conditioning was not significantly associated with the incidence of LM after HSCT probably because of absolute low patient number who developed LM in our series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In terms of LM development after HSCT, low-dose TBI in HSCT for SAA to avoid graft rejection, which is commonly used in Japan, might be tolerable in the Japanese population because of its low incidence </plain></SENT>
