<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Their blood sera and secretions of the nasal cavity were examined in the indirect hemagglutination (IHA) test with dried standard erythrocyte diagnostic preparations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CVI was shown to be activated in three year cycles in immunodeficient patients, which occurred, respectively, in 66.1, 56.9, 47.8 and 51.6% of cases in the above mentioned groups of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 87% of cases CVI was associated with other respiratory pathogens, the following being prevailed: respiratory syncytial virus (37.9%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0030389" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">parainfluenza</z:e> virus (32.2%) and Mycoplasma pneumoniae (36.8%) </plain></SENT>
