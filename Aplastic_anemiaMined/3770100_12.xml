<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Several studies suggest that serum factors (thrombopoietins) regulate thrombopoiesis by altering the number, size, ploidy, and maturation rate of megakaryocytes (MK) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Various in vivo systems have been used to quantitate these events </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, an in vitro system was developed to monitor terminal cytoplasmic maturation of isolated human MK </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MK enriched by elutriation, which eliminated the MK progenitors, were suspended in culture with serum from either <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> donors (NABS) or patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AAS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In cultures composed of small platelet <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi>-positive mononuclear cells and morphologically immature MK, development was characterized by sequential shifts in MK through morphologically recognizable maturation stages I, II, III, and IV over eight days of incubation (I and II only; then I, II, III; II, III, IV; III and IV; then IV only) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Platelet formation coincided with the appearances of stage IV cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cultures composed of a mixture of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> stages followed a similar maturation sequence, only at an accelerated rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AAS</z:e> resulted in the more rapid appearances of the mature cells in either system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study indicates that human MK can undergo terminal cytoplasmic maturation in vitro, and that altering culture conditions (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AAS</z:e> for NABS) can accelerate the rate of maturation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three major events occur during megakaryocytopoiesis: proliferation of the progenitor cells, polyploidization, and cytoplasmic maturation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Now it is possible to study the terminal steps of differentiation independent of proliferative events </plain></SENT>
