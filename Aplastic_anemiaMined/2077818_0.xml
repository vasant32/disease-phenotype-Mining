<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis was made on the basis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001878'>hemolytic anemia</z:hpo>, a positive Ham test and <z:mp ids='MP_0000327'>hemosiderinuria</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Six patients had primary <z:hpo ids='HP_0004818'>paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</z:hpo> evolved from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These four patients also had a milder form of the disease, Over long periods of the follow-up, large variations of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> values and red blood cell counts were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Both absolute and percent reticulocyte counts were increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Erythroblast counts in the bone marrow were 3-5 times higher than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Reticulocyte counts in the bone marrow were 3-5 times higher than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Reticulocyte counts showed wide variations but substantially smaller than those in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001890'>autoimmune hemolytic anemias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Serum iron was either <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or increased, while the bone marrow iron store was high or low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, the finding of urinary hemosiderin in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases spoke against <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of iron stores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The red blood cell life span was moderately shortened </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Kinetic studies with 59Fe showed a high red blood cell iron incorporation, while the curves frequently had irregular shapes (broken curve) or an early, abrupt fall </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Studies of late erythroid progenitors (CFU-E) indicated that this compartment was preserved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Even after long observation periods was no stem cell pool <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> due to an increased red blood cell demand observed </plain></SENT>
