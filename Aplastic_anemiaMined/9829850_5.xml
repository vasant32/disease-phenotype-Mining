<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here, we report the case of a previously healthy, 65-year-old patient who was found simultaneously to have a spindle-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0100522'>thymoma</z:hpo> and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001908'>hypoplastic anemia</z:hpo> with a mild infiltration of the bone marrow by CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes, CD16+ natural killer cells, and a decrease in blood CD4/CD8 ratio </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cultures of marrow erythroid progenitors demonstrated serum inhibitor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>While steroids, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> and antilymphocyte globulin failed to improve hematopoiesis, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> A (Cy-A) led to a partial, stable remission that was sustained for 4 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Since Cy-A has been associated with good responses in three cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100522'>thymoma</z:hpo>-associated red cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath>, we recommend its use in cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100522'>thymoma</z:hpo>-associated cytopenias refractory to steroids and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
