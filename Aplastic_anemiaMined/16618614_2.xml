<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A 46-year-old woman developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD after bone marrow transplantation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">KCS</z:e> with corneal melting and calcium deposits were noted in the left eye </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Penetrating keratoplasty was performed because of <z:hpo ids='HP_0100583'>corneal perforation</z:hpo>, but poor re-epithelialization and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_36'>calcium deposition</z:mpath> recurred </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After regraft, AMT and tarsorrhaphy, the corneal graft remained clear for 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, breakdown of the corneal epithelium occurred 3 weeks after spontaneous separation of tarsorrhaphy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Six months later, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100583'>corneal perforation</z:hpo> recurred again along with exacerbation of GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Regraft was performed, but the patient refused tarsorrhaphy and AMT </plain></SENT>
