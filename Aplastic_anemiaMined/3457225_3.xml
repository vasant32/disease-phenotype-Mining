<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A patient presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> erythromyelosis (DiGuglielmo) which was developed after 3 yr of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>Aplastic anemia</z:hpo> differed from the classical form, since erythroid cells and megakaryocytes were relatively preserved in the bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Treatment with <z:chebi fb="5" ids="50113">androgens</z:chebi> induced the increase of hematocrit and reticulocyte as well as general improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The sudden appearance of hemorrhagic syndrome due to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> was associated with aggravation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001913'>granulocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the bone marrow, giant multinuclear proerythroblasts with bizarre nuclear <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> and <z:chebi fb="61" ids="27565">PAS</z:chebi> positivity with coarse granules was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serum erythropoietin (Ep) level was high </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow cells culture in vitro revealed two types of erythroid colonies: typical and giant multinuclear cells, both benzidine-positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The number of colonies was irrespective to the Ep dose. "Autonomous" Ep independent growth of these colonies was also demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The number of colonies was more than 3 times higher per number of cells seeded when compared to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normals</z:mpath>, which indicated malignant proliferation and Ep independent growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Treatment with <z:chebi fb="1" ids="50667">6-mercaptopurine</z:chebi> and transfusions was without effect and the patient died after 15 days with signs of cerebral <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
