<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 20 consecutive patients who developed respiratory syncytial virus <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> after bone marrow transplantation and who had high-resolution CT of the chest performed within 24 hr after the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of symptoms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The CT scans were reviewed by two chest radiologists who assessed the pattern and distribution of findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Bone marrow transplantation was performed on 12 male and eight female patients ranging from 3 to 48 years old (mean age, 25 years) for treatment of various forms of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (n = 12), severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (n = 6), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015625" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Fanconi's syndrome</z:e> (n = 1), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004818'>paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</z:hpo> (n = 1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sixteen patients (80%) had abnormal CT findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The predominant patterns of abnormality on high-resolution CT scans were small centrilobular nodules (10/20, 50%), air-space consolidation (7/20, 35%), ground-glass opacities (6/20, 30%), and bronchial wall thickening (6/20, 30%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The abnormalities were distributed in the central and peripheral areas of the lungs in nine cases, only in the periphery in five cases, and only in the central regions in two cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The abnormalities were bilateral and asymmetric in distribution in 13 patients, bilateral and symmetric in two patients, and unilateral in one patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The most common high-resolution CT findings in patients with respiratory syncytial virus <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> after bone marrow transplantation consist of small centrilobular nodules and multifocal areas of consolidation and ground-glass opacities in a bilateral asymmetric distribution </plain></SENT>
