<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: AnWj is a high-prevalence red blood cell (RBC) antigen in the ISBT 901 series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Only nine reports of anti-AnWj have been published since it was first documented in 1972; two of these cases involved transfusion reactions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We present a case of a patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> who developed anti-AnWj with clinically significant <z:mp ids='MP_0010163'>hemolysis</z:mp> after transfusion of AnWj-positive RBCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A 56-year-old woman with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> developed a pan-reactive antibody with clinically significant <z:mp ids='MP_0010163'>hemolysis</z:mp> after transfusion of RBCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Investigations included antibody identification by serologic methods at the national immunohematology reference laboratory and the in vitro monocyte-monolayer assay (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="34840">MMA</z:chebi>) to predict clinical significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The antibody was identified as having specificity for the AnWj antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The posttransfusion <z:chebi fb="0" ids="34840">MMA</z:chebi> indicated that the antibody had complement-fixing capability highly likely to cause clinically significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221123" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemolytic transfusion reactions</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The patient required long-term transfusion support with AnWj-negative RBCs and Lu(a-b-) RBCs of the In(Lu) type which have reduced AnWj expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Cross-Canada and international collaboration was required to obtain rare units for transfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221123" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemolytic transfusion reaction</z:e> caused by anti-AnWj is reported in a patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> requiring allogeneic stem cell transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This is the second documented case of anti-AnWj to cause a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0221123" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemolytic transfusion reaction</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The case demonstrates the complexity of managing patients with rare antibodies and the importance of international collaboration in the management of these difficult cases </plain></SENT>
