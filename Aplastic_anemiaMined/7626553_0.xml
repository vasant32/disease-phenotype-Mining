<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVES: Immune suppression (IS) therapy has provided another opportunity of cure or improvement in the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> patients who cannot receive bone marrow transplantation due to many causes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There are a few reports regarding the factors that affect response, survival and prognosis after IS therapy, including antilymphocyte globulin (ALG) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we analysed our experience to determine the prognostic factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Statistically analysed were 172 patients, from April 1982 to July 1992, who were diagnosed as severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and treated with IS therapy, including ALG, at Catholic University Medical College, St </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mary's Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Among 172 severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (SAA) patients who entered the study from April 1982 to July 1992, 144 patients were analysed for response and 122 patient for survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>58.4% (84/144) responded after the first course of IS therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among those who did not respond on the first course an additional 44% (11/25) responded after the second course of IS therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Prognostic factors that might affect the response to the treatment and survival were analysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In a univariate analysis of patients with no previous history of treatment before is therapy, and a shorter interval between diagnosis and treatment, higher <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> levels before IS therapy, and higher granulocyte counts and combined use use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi>(CSA) were positively associated with response (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The combined use of CSA during IS therapy, younger age, lower monthly requirement of platelets transfusion before IS therapy, higher leukocyte counts, higher percent of polymorphonuclear leukocytes, lower percent of lymphocyte, higher bone marrow cellularity and response were positively associated with survival (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In a multivariate analysis, shorter interval between diagnosis and treatment, no combined use of hemopoietic stimulants, such as <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi>, and lesser total amount of transfusion were positively associated with Response (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Higher leukocyte counts before IS therapy and the combined use of CSA during IS therapy were significantly associated with longer survival (p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Patients with complete or partial response had excellent prognosis (96.7%-100% of 5 year survival rates) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In contrast, patients with no response after IS therapy had 45.1% of 5 year survival rates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: With these results from the retrospective study of IS therapy, we find many valuable factors that have an influence on response or survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>IS therapy improves the survival of responded patients with SAA, and we confirmed that IS therapy is an important therapeutic tool for the SAA patients who are not feasible candidates for bone marrow transplantation </plain></SENT>
