<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The impact of early detection of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010823" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">CMV infections</z:e> in allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) and of early treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="465284">ganciclovir</z:chebi> is still uncertain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: 98 patients undergoing allogeneic BMT for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> (n = 91) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (n = 7) were monitored weekly for the expression of the lower matrix protein pp65 of cytomegalovirus (CMV) on peripheral blood cells (PB) and urine sediments (U) as detected by C10 and C11 monoclonal antibodies (Clonab, Biotest) and immunoperoxidase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cytospin preparations were also studied in patients with clinically documented interstitial <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients were considered to be infected with CMV if pp65 was detected in PB (n = 15) or BAL cells (n = 6), or in the presence of serum CMV-IgM with (n = 7) or without (n = 3) pp65-positive cells in urine sediments </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall actuarial risk at 300 days of developing a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010823" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">CMV infection</z:e> was 35% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CMV serum/status (IgG) pre-BMT of donor and/or recipient predicted the occurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010823" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">CMV infections</z:e> post-BMT: in neg/neg donor/recipient pairs (n = 17) the actuarial risk at 300 days was 0%, compared to 41% in pairs in which donor and/or recipient were CMV seropositive (n = 81) (p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>24/31 patients were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="465284">ganciclovir</z:chebi> (DHPG), and 17 survive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mortality of patients treated early with DHPG on the basis of CMV antigenemia was 18% compared to 42% for untreated patients (p = 0.9) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Pretransplant donor/recipient seropositivity accurately predicted transplant related mortality (TBM): 6% in neg/neg pairs vs 41% in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other combinations (p = 0.008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The risk of developing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010823" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">CMV infections</z:e> post-BMT can be predicted by pre-transplant serostatus, diagnosed by monitoring the expression of pp65-protein and correlates with transplant related mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The latter appears to be reduced by early treatment with DHPG </plain></SENT>
