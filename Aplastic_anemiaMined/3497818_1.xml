<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Recent studies suggest that megakaryocytopoiesis is governed by a dual-level regulatory process, with megakaryocyte colony-stimulating factor (Meg-CSF) primarily influencing proliferation of the committed precursors and thrombopoietin required for megakaryocyte ploidy amplification and for maturation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The authors have examined different sources of Meg-CSF in a microagar culture system with a view to their capacity to enhance megakaryocyte colony formation directly or via an indirect T-lymphocyte- or monocyte-mediated effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The comparative influences of phytohemagglutinin-stimulated leukocyte-conditioned medium (PHA-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LCM</z:e>), erythropoietin (Epo), sera of patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, and direct PHA addition to the culture were evaluated for their capacity to enhance megakaryocytic colony formation as well as for the maturation rate of megakaryocytes (Mk) grown in our microagar culture system </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Removal of T-lymphocytes and monocytes from the bone marrow sample caused a cessation of the enhancing effect of direct PHA addition to cultures stimulated with Epo, but did not influence the enhancing activities of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> serum (SAA), PHA-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LCM</z:e>, and Epo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results show that SAA serum, Epo, and PHA-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">LCM</z:e> induced Mk colony formation directly and therefore may act via a common mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Differences, however, were observed concerning their colony-stimulating potency and their influence on the Mk maturation rate </plain></SENT>
