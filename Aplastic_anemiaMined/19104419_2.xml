<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The indication of lung transplantation for patients with pulmonary complications of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) remains controversial, and only few such cases have been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We reviewed our experiences regarding living-donor lobar lung transplantation (LDLLT) in patients with pulmonary complications of HSCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We reviewed and assessed seven patients (age, 6-45 yr) who underwent LDLLT at Okayama University Hospital for pulmonary complications of HSCT (HSCT group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Their characteristics and postoperative results were compared with those of 41 LDLLT without HSCT patients (non-HSCT group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the HSCT group, indications for LDLLT included <z:hpo ids='HP_0011946'>bronchiolitis obliterans</z:hpo> (n=6) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002206'>pulmonary fibrosis</z:hpo> (n=1) that had developed after treatments involving HSCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Preexisting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic diseases</z:e> included <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> lymphocyte <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (n=4), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> promyelocystic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (n=1), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (n=1), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (n=1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the HSCT group, two patients died due to infectious complications, whereas five are currently alive (an overall survival of 71.4%) without any recurrence of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic diseases</z:e> (mean follow-up period, 35.7 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The mean of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> rejection episodes was 1.1 per patient in the HSCT group and 1.8 in the non-HSCT group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One of the seven HSCT (14.4%) and 10 non-HSCT (24.4%) patients have currently developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011946'>bronchiolitis obliterans</z:hpo> syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our results showed that LDLLT for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002093'>respiratory failure</z:hpo> because of pulmonary complications of HSCT could be an effective approach with less rejection episodes; however, it has a possibly higher risk of the development of infectious complications </plain></SENT>
