<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Polymerase chain reaction-amplified short tandem repeat genotyping was used for early confirmation of donor engraftment after PBSC transplantation (PBSCT) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Engraftment was prompt for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients; it was verified using a panel of 12 human polymorphic short tandem repeat loci from bone marrow as early as 7 days posttransplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This status was maintained until relapse, when mixed chimerism was detected using the polymerase chain reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A minimum resurgence of recipient cells to 1% of the population was required to detect chimerism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median times to recovery of the absolute neutrophil count to greater than 0.5 x 10(9)/L and the sustained platelet count to greater than 20 x 10(9)/L without transfusion were 10 and 12 days after PBSCT, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Six patients experienced <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD, Grade I in two patients and Grade II in four, including two HLA-haploidentical recipients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>Chronic</z:hpo> GVHD was noticed in three of the 11 patients who were followed for at least 100 days after PBSCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Ten patients were still alive at the latest follow-up and have been disease free for a median of 278 days (range 60-671) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Five patients died from causes other than graft failure: three from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> relapse and two from transplant-related complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The results confirm that G-CSF can be safely administered to healthy donors and that engraftment after allogeneic PBSCT is fast and durable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Complete chimerism can be detected early by genomic analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>PBSCT may offer an alternative to bone marrow transplantation </plain></SENT>
