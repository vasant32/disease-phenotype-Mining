<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The serological studies of his serum revealed: (1) the absence of platelet-reactive antibodies; (2) the absence of agglutinating or cytotoxic antibodies against leukocytes; (3) the presence of at least two granulocyte-specific antibodies, one with the specificity anti-NA2 and the other with an undefined specificity, both only detectable by indirect immunofluorescence, and (4) the presence of cytotoxic-negative fluorescence-positive peripheral-blood-mononuclear-cell-reactive antibodies, not directed against HLA-A, B or C antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The significance and implications of these findings are briefly discussed </plain></SENT>
