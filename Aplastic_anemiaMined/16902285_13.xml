<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the disease has been described 30 years ago, the etiology and pathomechanisms are still obscure, and consensus for therapy is lacking </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Numerous case reports of patients with EF exist but series are scarce </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eleven patients with EF from the Department of Dermatology, Kantonsspital Aarau, the University Hospital Basel and the Outpatient Clinic of Dermatology, Triemli Hospital Zurich, Switzerland, were retrospectively studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 4 patients the initial diagnosis was not recognized by the referring nondermatologists </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median age was 55 years, excluding the youngest patient ever diagnosed with EF (age = 1 year) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients showed an induration of the skin, which led to painful <z:hpo ids='HP_0001371'>contractures</z:hpo> in the joints in 3 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> but 2 patients demonstrated <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>edema</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A slight predominance of the upper extremities was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011838'>Sclerodactyly</z:hpo> was noticed in 1 patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Three patients reported an initial trauma at the affected site </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Two patients were tested positive for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006035" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">borreliosis</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>One patient subsequently developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000872'>Hashimoto thyroiditis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Visceral or extracutaneous involvement was absent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Eight patients had a full or partial recovery under <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> whereas in 2, improvement could be achieved only with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="2948">azathioprine</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of EF can be established by clinical, laboratory and histological findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In general, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> are highly efficacious in EF and only a minority of patients need other immunosuppressive or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35610">cytostatic</z:chebi> drugs </plain></SENT>
