<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The objectives of this study were to develop a physiological model for the metabolism of <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi>, based on studies in laboratory animals, and to use this model to predict <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> metabolism in people to concentrations near the current permissible exposure limits </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Model simulations predicted that for 8-h inhalation exposures to below 10 ppm, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17594">hydroquinone</z:chebi> metabolites would predominate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="17594">Hydroquinone</z:chebi> is associated with pathways leading to the formation of the putative toxic metabolite, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16509,39439">benzoquinone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Lower levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38407">muconic acid</z:chebi>, a marker for the putative toxic metabolite, muconaldehyde, were predicted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At concentrations above 10 ppm, detoxification metabolites such as the <z:chebi fb="1" ids="30396">phenyl</z:chebi> conjugates predominate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Predictions of <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> metabolism in humans based on our physiological model may have important implications for risk assessment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Because there may be preferential production of a putative toxic metabolite at low exposure concentrations, linear extrapolation of toxicity observed at high concentrations may underestimate risk at low exposure concentrations </plain></SENT>
