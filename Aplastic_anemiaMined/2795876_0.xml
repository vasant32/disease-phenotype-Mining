<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These fibroblasts were treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi> as well </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow fibroblasts of healthy subjects and patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, and the supernatant of their conditioned medium significantly inhibited <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> erythroid colony formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A significantly marked inhibition of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> erythroid colony formation was observed of bone marrow fibroblasts (or the conditioned medium) of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, when compared with that of the bone marrow of healthy subject fibroblasts (or the conditioned medium) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>By treating both groups of the bone marrow fibroblasts with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi> the inhibition was slightly improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>From the above experimental results, it was suggested that the bone marrow fibroblasts and the conditioned medium inhibited <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> erythroid colony formation through humoral factors secreted by the fibroblasts, and through contact between the fibroblasts and erythroid colony formation cells </plain></SENT>
