<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with posthepatitis AA had decreased proportions of T4 cells, increased proportions of T8 cells, and decreased T4:T8 ratios </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with constitutional AA had varied immunologic findings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were no significant abnormalities in lymphocyte subsets in patients with idiopathic AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the 12 patients who were treated with antithymocyte globulin (ATG), six (50%) responded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nine of these patients are living 3-27 months after treatment; three of the nine are transfusion dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>T-cell subsets were not helpful in predicting the response to ATG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Measurements of other immunologic mediators may be more useful with regard to pathophysiology and prognosis in AA </plain></SENT>
