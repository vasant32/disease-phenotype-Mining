<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In a small fraction ( approximately 2%) of cases of childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) clinical presentation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> is preceded, some 2-9 months earlier, by a transient, remitting phase of nonclassical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, usually in connection with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The potential "preleukemic" nature of this prodromal phase has not been fully explored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have retrospectively analyzed the blood and bone marrow of a child who presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> 9 months before the development of ETV6-RUNX1 fusion gene positive ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>High resolution SNP genotyping arrays identified 11 regions of loss of heterozygosity, with and without concurrent copy number changes, at the presentation of ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases of copy number change, the deletion or gain identified by single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis was confirmed in the ALL blasts by FISH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Retrospective analysis of aplastic phase bone marrow showed that the ETV6-RUNX1 fusion was present along with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the additional genetic changes assessed, albeit subclonal to ETV6-RUNX1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These data identify for the first time the leukemic genotype of an <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> preceding clinical ALL and indicate that multiple secondary genetic abnormalities can contribute to a dominant subclone several months before a diagnosis of ALL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data have implications for the biology of ALL and for management of similar patients </plain></SENT>
