<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Serum from eight children with AA did not inhibit colony formation when added to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> adult bone marrow cells in culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The defect in AA residues in the stem cell, with involvement of the CSA-producing cells in some cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The serum of these patients does not contain an inhibitor of granulopoiesis </plain></SENT>
