<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>For young adults and children who have a bone marrow donor who is a genotypic or phenotypic sibling match, bone marrow transplantation is now the preferred treatment for severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For those who lack such a matched donor, use of matched unrelated donors and family member donors who are mismatched for a single HLA antigen have been successful and appear to be the treatment of choice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients lacking either of these alternatives should receive antilymphocyte globulin, either alone or combined with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> as a first step </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although the success rate of marrow transplants in our series using mismatched family donors is similar to that following treatment with antilymphocyte globulin, several caveats must be kept in mind </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>First, the results reported with use of alternative donors must be confirmed with study of larger numbers of patients and longer follow-up </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Second, the preparative regimen given prior to bone marrow transplantation destroys the patient's residual bone marrow, whereas antilymphocyte globulin <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> A and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="50113">androgens</z:chebi> do not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The sequence of immunosuppression followed by transplantation with alternative donor marrow should produce greater long-term hematopoietic improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, when marrow transplant follows one or more courses of immunosuppressive therapy, nonengraftment is then a problem because of sensitization to blood cell antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It should also be kept in mind that studies done in children, especially in those younger than 6 years old, show that these patients respond better to transplantation than to treatment regimens not including marrow transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, for the child with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, every effort should be made to identify a suitable bone marrow donor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Finally, we need to determine the specific components of the conditioning regimen and the constitution of the donor marrow necessary for engraftment and to minimize potential long-term complications, and there should be only a tolerable degree of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Many of the transplant-related problems that plagued us in the 1970s have still not been fully resolved, but many have shown improvement </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>As we enter the 1990s, increasing the pool of marrow donors for patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> who lack an HLA-matched sibling will continue to be a top priority for research </plain></SENT>
