<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) and failure of engraftment have limited the widespread application of this technology to nonmalignant <z:mp ids='MP_0002054'>disease states</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The use of purified bone marrow stem cells has been suggested as an approach to promote engraftment yet avoid GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although bone marrow stem cells, purified by cell sorting, engraft and repopulate lethally irradiated genetically identical recipients, they do not engraft in major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-disparate allogeneic recipients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We report for the first time the characterization of a novel cell population of donor bone marrow origin, separate from the hematopoietic stem cell, that facilitates engraftment of purified allogeneic bone marrow stem cells in an MHC-specific fashion without causing GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although 1,000 purified stem cells (c-kit+/Sca-1+/lineage-) reliably repopulate syngeneic mouse recipients, 10 times that number do not engraft in MHC-disparate allogeneic recipients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The addition of as few as 30,000 facilitating cells (CD8+/CD45R+/TCR-) is sufficient to permit engraftment of purified stem cells in MHC-disparate recipients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cell surface phenotype of this purified cellular population differs significantly from other characterized lineages of lymphoid or myeloid origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Based on multiparameter rare-events cell sorting, the facilitating fraction is CD8+, CD3+, CD45R+, Thy 1+, class IIdim/intermediate but alpha beta-TCR- and gamma delta-TCR- </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This cellular population comprises approximately 0.4% of the total bone marrow and is separate from the hematopoietic stem cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The coadministration of purified facilitating cells plus stem cells to optimize engraftment yet avoid GVHD may expand the potential application of bone marrow transplantation to <z:mp ids='MP_0002054'>disease states</z:mp> in which the morbidity and mortality associated with conventional BMT cannot be justified </plain></SENT>
