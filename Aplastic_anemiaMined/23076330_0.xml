<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We describe a young woman with profound <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> whose serum iron studies were incongruous with what we expected from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001891'>iron deficiency anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Her high serum iron was not fully explainable until we examined the patient and noticed a large black tattoo on her left flank area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Apparently <z:chebi fb="27" ids="50820">iron oxide</z:chebi> in the ink used for the tattoo was absorbed transcutaneously and led to high serum iron in the face of the other data, which suggested <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0240066" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron deficiency</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>She was slow in mobilizing her serum iron for erythropoiesis and we discovered that there was a concurrent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> B19 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0205882" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">parvovirus infection</z:e>, which impeded utilization of the iron for red blood cell production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We believe that this case report reinforces the imperative to always do a careful physical examination with any patient who has <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, and also illustrates the potential toxicity of tattoo ink </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The impairment of utilization of the serum iron because of the patient's <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> B19 <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0205882" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">parvovirus infection</z:e> demonstrates the many consequences of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0858744" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection induced</z:e> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
