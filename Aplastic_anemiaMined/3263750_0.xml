<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The immunophenotyping results were correlated to in vitro tests of NK cell cytotoxicity against K562 cells and of immunoglobulin (Ig) production after pokeweed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi> (PWM) stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A significant decrease was found both in the percentage of Leu 11 positive cells and in NK cell activity as compared to age- and sex-matched healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The decrease in NK cell activity could not be entirely compensated by an increase in effector/target cell ratios, thus suggesting not only a quantitative but also a functional defect in NK cells of the AA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three of four AA patients tested showed no major increase of Ig production after PWM stimulation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> these three patients also had fewer "functional T helper" cells (Leu3+/Leu8-) and increased numbers of T suppressor/cytotoxic cells (Leu2+) when compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant differences in numbers of B lymphocytes (B1+) could be found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our findings suggest a possible linkage between quantitative and qualitative abnormalities in lymphocyte subsets in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, no evidence was found to support the hypothesis of increased NK cell activation behind the hemopoietic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> in this disease </plain></SENT>
