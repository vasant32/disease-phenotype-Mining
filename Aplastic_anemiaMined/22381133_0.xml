<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the incidence and types of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> in a large cohort of paediatric patients with AA referred to eight AIEOP (Italian Association of Paediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>Oncology</z:hpo> and Haematology) centres in Italy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The study included 78 patients, 45 boys and 33 girls, median age 9.29 yrs (1st-3rd quartile 3.59-13.09) diagnosed with AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During the study period, 111 infectious episodes were observed in 42 (54%) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fifty-one (46%) episodes were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> of unknown origin and 60 (54%) were documented <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> (DI) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The rate (episodes/1000 d at risk) was similar in severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and very severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> both before and after day 120 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>During the first 120 d from diagnosis, the cumulative risk of a DI was 21% (95% CI 12-29) with the last episode at day 117, but the 50% of episodes were observed in the first 24 d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After day 120, the cumulative risk of DI was again 21% (95% CI 12-29), with the last episode at day 445 of follow-up, with 50% of episodes observed in the first 120 d of observation (240 d from the diagnosis of AA) </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>No association was found between gender, age at diagnosis, response at day +120 and at day +180, use of G-CSF and occurrence of IEs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The actuarial overall survival at 5 yrs was 90% Â± 3.6 </plain></SENT>
