<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The clinical data of the children with newly diagnosed HAAA from January 2007 to December 2008 were respectively studied, including clinical manifestations, and blood routine, bone marrow examination, <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> serology and immune function results as well as treatment and prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A total of 8 children were confirmed as HAAA, accounting for 4.9% in children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were 7 males and 1 female </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median age was 7.5 years (range 4.4 to 10.3 years) at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They had negative serologic results and the causes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> could not be identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median interval from <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> occurrence to blood cell reduction was 6 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Three cases were diagnosed as severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and 5 cases as very severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Severe T cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0947760" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">immune disorders</z:e> were found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 8 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The percentage of Ts cells increased and the percentage of Th cells decreased significantly in the 8 children with HAAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Four children survived after immune suppress treatment, three children died within one month after diagnosis and one child required own discharge without treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: HAAA is more frequent in male school children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The children with HAAA have severe T cell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0947760" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">immune disorders</z:e>, with a higher early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Immune suppress treatment is effective </plain></SENT>
