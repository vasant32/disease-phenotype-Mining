<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have used a novel method to conduct non-myeloablative stem cell transplantation (NST), making the following changes in previous methods: Use of the cheapest conditioning drugs, tailored number of apheresis sessions in the donors, elimination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="465284">ganciclovir</z:chebi> and IgG, outpatient conduction when possible, diminished number of transfusions of blood products and diminished number of donor lymphocyte infusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>With this method, we have prospectively conducted 70 allografts in patients with different diseases: <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>Chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002875" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thalassemia major</z:e>, relapsed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkins disease</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1260899" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="BDS">Blackfan-Diamond syndrome</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In them, the median granulocyte recovery time to 0.5 x 10(9)/L was 11 d, whereas the median platelet recovery time to 20 x 10(9)/L was 12 d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients did not need red blood cell transfusions and 17 did not need platelet transfusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In 55 individuals (78%), the procedure could be completed fully on an outpatient basis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Follow-up times range between 30 and 800 d.: Four patients failed to engraft and recovered endogenous hemopoiesis; 16 patients (23%) developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) whereas 28 (49%) developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thirty two patients (47%) have died: 21 with a relapsing disease and seven as a result of GVHD; the median post-trasplant survival (SV) was 420 d., whereas the 12-mo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>SV was 42% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The 100-day mortality was 3.8% and the transplant-related mortality was 14.2% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The median cost of the allografts was 18,000.00 US dollars </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This method could be particularly adequate in developing countries, where very few individuals can afford the cost of a conventional bone marrow transplantation procedure </plain></SENT>
