<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Wagner's Method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We were able to determine presumable composition of the glue chemical components </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The different substances were evaporated at different times fixed by appropriate peaks on chromatogram </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There have been at least five toxic substances identified within the glue composition, which are used as industrial or household chemical goods and as some authors explain, may be used as inhaling psychoactive substances </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These substances are: <z:chebi fb="2" ids="16716">benzol</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi>), <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17578">toluene</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17578">toluol</z:chebi>), <z:chebi fb="43" ids="15882">phenol</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="9" ids="15882">carbolic acid</z:chebi>), <z:chebi fb="59" ids="35255">chloroform</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="15347,51867">methyl-ketone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The glue is inhaled with a small <z:chebi fb="73" ids="53226,53227">polyethylene</z:chebi> bag </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The substances are evaporated during inhalation and join arterial blood through lungs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In several minutes leap forward a situation similar to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001969" disease_type="Mental or Behavioral Dysfunction" abbrv="">alcohol intoxication</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The evaporated substances characterized by strong toxicity and influence to the organism in different ways </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> glue abuse is serious, such as lethal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, marrow damage, chromosome aberrations, functional disorders of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi>, dystrophic changes in myocardium, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo>, liver <z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>atrophy</z:mpath> and so on </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Abuse of the glue "RAZI" can lead to very serious medical consequences and represents emerging public health problem in Georgia </plain></SENT>
