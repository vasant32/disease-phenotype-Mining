<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>He worked in a petroleum resin-producing factory and had been exposed to low-level <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> while packaging the powder resin and pouring lime into a deactivation tank </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>According to the yearly environmental survey of the working area, the airborne <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> level was approximately 0.28 ppm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Exposure to <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi>, a common chemical used widely in industry, may progressively lead to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The hematotoxicity of <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> is related to the amount and duration of exposure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Most risk predictions for <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> exposures have been based on rubber workers who were exposed to high concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the petroleum industry, the concentration of <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> is relatively low, and there are disputes over the toxicity of low-level <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> because of a lack of evidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In this paper we report the case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> induced by low-level <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> exposure </plain></SENT>
