<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For this purpose BM T-enriched cells from 11 AA patients and 9 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals were incubated with ALG (0-1000 micrograms/ml) or PHA (0%-10%) for 1 day, and the supernatants were tested for suppression/enhancement of granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming unit (CFU-GM) growth and for release of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) assayed with the enzyme-amplified sensitivity immunoassay (EASI) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The production of colony-stimulating activity (CSA) by T cells primed with ALG and tested in the absence of exogenous GM-CSF correlated with the dose of ALG in priming cultures up to 14% EG (100% EG = CFU-GM growth with 30 ng/ml of GM-CSF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The amount of GM-CSF in the supernatants paralleled their capacity to sustain CFU-GM growth (up to 3.5 ng/ml of GM-CSF) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Production of CSA or GM-CSF from T cells primed with PHA was significantly lower </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Supernatants of PHA-primed T cells, when added to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> BM cells in the presence of exogenous GM-CSF, produced a dose-dependent inhibition of CFU-GM growth (down to 13% +/- 10% EG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The same supernatants contained detectable amounts of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha (21 +/- 6.7 IU/ml and 4.6 +/- 2.9 ng/ml, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>IFN-gamma production from severe AA (SAA) T cells in response to PHA was significantly superior to the IFN-gamma production from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> T cells (21 +/- 6.7 IU/ml vs 9.5 +/- 7.1 IU/ml, p = 0.02).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
