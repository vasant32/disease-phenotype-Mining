<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In TNT exposed humans, the notable toxic manifestations have included <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, toxic <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000518'>cataract</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002240'>hepatomegaly</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002896'>liver cancer</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we developed methods to biomonitor workers exposed to TNT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The workers were employed in a typical ammunition factory in China </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The controls were recruited from the same factory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We determined <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (Hb) adducts and urine metabolites of TNT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hb-adducts of TNT, 4-amino-2,6-dinitrotoluene (4ADNT) and 2-amino-4,6-dinitrotoluene (2ADNT), and the urine metabolites of TNT, 4ADNT and 2ADNT were found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the workers and in a few controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>4ADNT was the main product </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although the levels of 2ADNT correlated well with 4ADNT, 2ADNT was not found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Therefore, 4ADNT was the best marker of exposure for Hb-adducts and urine metabolites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The levels of the urine metabolites and Hb-adducts were related to the health status of the workers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The Hb-adduct 4ADNT was statistically significantly associated with risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002240'>hepatomegaly</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001744'>splenomegaly</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000518'>cataract</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The odds ratio (OR) for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000518'>cataract</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001744'>splenomegaly</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002240'>hepatomegaly</z:hpo> were 6.4 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.4-29.6], 9.6 (1.1-85.3) and 7.6 (1.3-43.7), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No correlation was found between urine metabolites and health effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>These results were tested for confounding factors like age, workyears, smoker status, smoke years, cigarettes per day and <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> B status using stepwise forward logistic regression analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>In the case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001744'>splenomegaly</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> B status is a confounder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>In the case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000518'>cataract</z:hpo>, age is a confounder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>The Hb-adduct, 4ADNT, is a good biomarker of exposure and biomarker of biological effect </plain></SENT>
