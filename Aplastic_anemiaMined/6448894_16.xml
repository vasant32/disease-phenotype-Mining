<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Forty-four patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> were given marrow grafts from siblings selected on the basis of HLA-A and -B identity and mutual nonreactivity of their lymphocytes in mixed leukocyte culture (MLC) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty-two to 1089 days after grafting, their lymphocytes (of donor origin) were tested for reactivity in MLC to lymphocytes from the host (cryopreserved before grafting), the marrow donor, and unrelated individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Lymphocytes from 14 of 22 long-term survivors with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-vs-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) showed unidirectional reactivity in response to host lymphocytes manifested as high stimulation indices (SI) and high relative responses (RR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Lymphocytes from only 1 of 12 long-term survivors without <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD showed unidirectional reactivity to host lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Statistical analysis showed that lymphocytes from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD displayed anti-host responses that were significantly higher than those of lymphocytes from either marrow donors (p &lt; 0.001) or patients without GVHD (p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Lymphocytes from 5 patients with and 5 without <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD, tested shortly after marrow grafting, failed to show responses to host cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results are consistent with a participation of cell-mediated immunity of graft against host in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD </plain></SENT>
