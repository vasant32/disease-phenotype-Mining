<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN: Approximately 79 patients with AA (age, 37 +/- 17 years) and 66 control patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0100753'>schizophrenia</z:hpo> (age, 33 +/- 12 years) were examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Records were reviewed for demographic, clinical, and radiographic information </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Prior medical therapy, laboratory values, disease duration, and medical treatment response were noted for patients with AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Odds ratios (OR) and 95% CI were calculated for oral manifestations in cases and in control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Univariate analysis identified important variables for logistic regression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Patients with AA presented more frequently with oral <z:hpo ids='HP_0000967'>petechiae</z:hpo> (OR = 49; 95% CI, 2.9-825), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000212'>gingival hyperplasia</z:hpo> (OR = 27; 95% CI, 1.6-463.5), spontaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000225'>gingival bleeding</z:hpo> (OR = 27; 95% CI, 1.6-463.5), and herpetic lesions (OR = 27; 95% CI, 1.6-463.5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Prior <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> use was associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000212'>gingival hyperplasia</z:hpo> (P =.0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No other predictors for oral manifestations or treatment outcomes were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Oral soft tissue changes and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> were more common in patients with AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Prior <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> use was predictive of the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000212'>gingival hyperplasia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
