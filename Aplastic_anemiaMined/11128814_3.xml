<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We also examined the impact of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD on survival and identified patients at low risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD in whom immunosuppression might be stopped safely early after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among 489 patients with either grade 0 or I <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD, 33% developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Overall survival was 70%, and relapse-free survival was 63% at 8 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Risk factors for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD were found to include donor buffy coat infusions among patients given transplants for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (relative risk [RR] = 2.9, P = .05), patient-donor sex/parity combination (likelihood ratio test, P &lt; .001), grade I <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD (RR = 1.6, P = .003), and active <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010823" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">cytomegalovirus infection</z:e> (RR = 1.5, P = .05) before day 60 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Among 45 patients aged &lt;19 years who had male donors, only 1 developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This group had an overall survival rate of 65% and a relapse-free survival rate of 54% at 8 years post-transplantation-a result not better than that among the entire cohort </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The lack of improvement in survival in the low-risk group was related to a high rate of relapse of the underlying diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, the development of de novo <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD does not have a negative impact on patient survival; the adverse effect from increased transplantation-related complications is offset by a lower relapse rate, the result of an allogeneic graft-versus-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> effect </plain></SENT>
