<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Analysis of additional endpoints may help in treatment decisions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a single-center study, patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> treated with IS (n=155) or BMT (n=52) were compared for survival, event-free survival, and quality-adjusted time without symptoms and toxicity (Q-TWiST) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Probability of overall and event-free survival at 15 years was similar among both groups (BMT 51+/-15% and 25+/-14%, IS 53+/-10% and 27+/-8%), with more early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in the transplant group and more late <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> in the IS group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were differences in terms of mean duration of seven analyzed health states: time with symptoms from treatment-related toxicity (IS 0.36 years, BMT 0.27), transfusion dependency (IS 0.66 years, BMT 0.1 years), partial remission (IS 3.27 years, BMT 1.42), and secondary clonal disorder (IS 0.68 years, BMT 0.04) was significantly longer for IS compared to BMT (p&lt; or =0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients treated with BMT spent more time with extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GvHD) (IS 0 years, BMT 0.96, p&lt;0.023) and in CR without drugs (IS 1.22 years, BMT 2.43, p=0.056) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, survival, event-free survival, and Q-TWiST are similar </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>BMT-treated patients had longer periods free from symptoms, while IS-treated patients needed closer medical care, transfusion support, and medications </plain></SENT>
