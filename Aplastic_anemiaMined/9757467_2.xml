<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>On admission, she was drowny, CT showed a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> (SAH) in the right Sylvian fissure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Angiography demonstrated a complete occlusion of the superior sagittal sinus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The SAH was assumed to be originated from rupture of the right Sylvian vein, which was irregularly dilated on angiography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The dural sinus <z:mp ids='MP_0005048'>thrombosis</z:mp> was thought to be caused by a long term use of metenolone <z:chebi fb="49" ids="30089,47622">acetate</z:chebi>, and it was discontinued </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>But her platelet count dropped due to the aggravation of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, and she developed repeated hemorrhagic infarction </plain></SENT>
