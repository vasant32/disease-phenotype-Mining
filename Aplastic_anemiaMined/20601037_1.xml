<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Seventeen patients received transplants from mismatched donors via high-resolution DNA typing (8 of 8) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-eight patients received bone marrow and 12 peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">Graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) prophylaxis consisted of tacrolimus and short-course <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients achieved engraftment, and the median days of neutrophil and platelet recovery were 13 days and 20 days, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 5-year estimated overall survival was 88.0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cumulative incidences of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> grade II-IV GVHD (aGVHD) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD (cGVHD) were 46.0% and 50.3%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only an HLA-mismatched donor was associated with the occurrence of aGVHD on multivariate analyses, whereas prior aGVHD and the use of PBSCs were associated with the occurrence of cGVHD on univariate analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the excellent outcomes of u-SCT with TBI-800/Cy-120 suggest that u-SCT may be applicable to patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> even without prior treatment with immunosuppressive therapy, which will require testing in prospective trials in the future </plain></SENT>
