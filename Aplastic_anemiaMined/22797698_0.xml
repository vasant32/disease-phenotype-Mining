<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) is an immune-mediated bone marrow (BM) failure attacked by autoreactive effector T cells and BM is the main target organ </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs) were believed to control development and progression of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunity</z:hpo> by suppressing autoreactive effector T cells, but little was known regarding the function of Tregs in AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Our study demonstrated that both peripheral blood (PB) and BM had decreased frequencies of Tregs, accompanied with a reversed lower ratio of Treg frequencies between BM and PB in AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PB Tregs in AA had impaired migratory ability because of lower CXCR4 (but not for CXCR7) expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, we first showed that impairment of Treg-mediated immunosuppression was intrinsic to Tregs, rather than resistance of effector T cells to suppression in AA by coculture assays and criss-cross experiments in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, Tregs in AA were less able to inhibit interferon-Î³ production by effector T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Defective immunosuppression by Tregs could contribute to <z:mp ids='MP_0001606'>impaired hematopoiesis</z:mp> conducted by effector T cells in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our study provided powerful evidence that impairment of Tregs played a critical role in the pathophysiology of AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, patients with AA might greatly benefit from a Treg-oriented immunosuppressive strategy </plain></SENT>
