<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A total of 101 previously untreated patients (median age, 54 years; range, 19 to 75 years) were randomized to receive antithymocyte globulin (ATG) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> (CyA) (G-CSF- group) or ATG, CyA, and G-CSF (G-CSF+ group) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the G-CSF+ group, the hematologic response rate at 6 months was higher (77% vs 57%; P = .03) than in the G-CSF- group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>No differences were observed between the groups in terms of the incidence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> and febrile episodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There were no differences between the G-CSF- group and the G-CSF+ group in terms of survival (88% vs 94% at 4 years), and the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>)/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> (AL) (1 patient vs 2 patients) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the relapse rate was lower in the G-CSF+ group compared with the G-CSF- group (42% vs 15% at 4 years; P = .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Further follow-up is required to elucidate the role of G-CSF in immunosuppressive therapy for adult SAA </plain></SENT>
