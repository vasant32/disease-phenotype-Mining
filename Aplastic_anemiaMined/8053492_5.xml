<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To assess p53 expression in the hematopoietic cells of the bone marrow in premalignant as well as malignant conditions, we examined immunohistochemically bone marrow biopsies from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, n = 51), <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> (n = 42) and as a nonneoplastic condition, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (n = 20) and samples from individuals who had no hematological disorder (control, n = 12) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nuclear accumulation of p53 protein was found in seven of 51 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (14%) and two of 42 <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> patients (5%), whereas patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and control subjects were uniformly negative for p53 protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the bone marrow of patient with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, p53-positive cells constituted about 5 to 30% of the total bone marrow cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two-color immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the p53-positive cells were also positive for the myeloid cell marker </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Half of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases that evolved to overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (seven of 14) exhibited positive p53 reaction in the bone marrow at the time of initial diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This frequency (50%) was significantly higher than that in de novo <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the seven <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases that exhibited p53 expression at the time of initial diagnosis developed overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> later, and p53 expression was maintained throughout the progression of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that p53 mutations that occur in the myeloid cells in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> may confer a growth advantage to these cells resulting in the progression to overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Thus, immunohistochemical examination for p53 is very useful for predicting the evolution to overt <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
