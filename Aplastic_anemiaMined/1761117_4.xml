<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>35 persons received single FLI; those with recurrence or no response received two or more FLI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>8 received two; 7, three; 2, four; and 1, six FLI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There was a slow and incomplete autologous hematopoietic improvement in 40% and expected survival of 52% at 1 year, 45% at 2 yr, and 37% at 5 yr (Kaplan Meier estimate) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was rise in fetal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (Hb), 0-15.7%, (M-3.5) among responders in 3-20 (M-6) months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients who survived for more than 12 months had, on average, a longer duration of disease (4 months or more), and higher granulocyte and platelet counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Statistically, however, these differences were not significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Reticulocyte count was significantly lower in those who survived beyond 12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>1 patient developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> undifferentiated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> 3 yr post-FLI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The study indicates that fetal liver infusion is likely to benefit about 40% of individuals suffering from severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Longer surviving patients, however, may be at risk of developing clonal diseases </plain></SENT>
