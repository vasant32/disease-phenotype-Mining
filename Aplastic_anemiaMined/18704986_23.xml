<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: The authors investigated the risk of delayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0022658" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">kidney disease</z:e> (CKD) in 1190 adult hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) survivors who underwent HCT for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> between 1976 and 1997 and survived for at least 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: CKD was defined as a sustained elevation of serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> that indicated a glomerular filtration rate of &lt;60 mL per minute per 1.73 m2 for &gt; or =3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The median age at HCT was 35 years (range, 18.1-68.6 years), and the median length of follow-up was 7.1 years after HCT (range, 1-24.3 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Sixty patients with CKD were identified, resulting in a cumulative incidence of 4.4% at 5 years (autologous HCT, 3.8%; matched-sibling HCT, 4.5%; unrelated donor HCT, 10%; P = .09 compared with autologous HCT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Older age at HCT (relative risk [RR] per 5-year increment, 1.33; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2-1.5), exposure to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> without tacrolimus (RR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.1-3.4) or with tacrolimus (RR, 4.59; 95% CI, 1.8-11.5), and a primary diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> (RR, 2.51; 95% CI, 1.1-5.6) were associated with an increased risk of delayed CKD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the authors identified a subpopulation of patients who underwent HCT and remained at increased risk for CKD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The current findings set the stage for appropriate long-term follow-up of vulnerable patients </plain></SENT>
