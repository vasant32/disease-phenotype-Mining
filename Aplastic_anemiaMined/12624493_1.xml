<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 39-year-old woman with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (SAA) was transferred to our institution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>She also had autoimmune <z:hpo ids='HP_0100646'>thyroiditis</z:hpo> with several positive autoantibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clonal or oligoclonal T-cell proliferation was demonstrated by determining the size distribution of the complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) of T-cell receptor beta-chain (TCR-Vbeta) subfamilies in the patient's bone marrow and peripheral blood cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results suggested that hematopoiesis was suppressed by immune-mediated mechanisms </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Immunosuppressive therapy for SAA using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> (CsA) alone or concurrent CsA and antithymocyte globulin (ATG) failed to induce a hematological response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The intensity of the autoantibodies, however, partially decreased during this period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, the CD4/CD8 ratio was inverted after immunosuppressive therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These observations indicate that, in a subset of SAA, immune-mediated hematopoietic suppression cannot be successfully treated by conventional immunosuppressive therapy, even though a substantial improvement in the underlying immunological changes can be achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Other therapies such as hematopoietic stem cell transplantation or more intensified repeated ATG therapy may be necessary for such patients </plain></SENT>
