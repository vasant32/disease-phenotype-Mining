<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have encountered four patients who experienced six episodes of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001342'>intracerebral hemorrhage</z:hpo>; 3, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo>; 2, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100309'>subdural hematoma</z:hpo>; 1,) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>Intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> occurred without traumatic episodes, and was followed by frequent hemorrhagic episodes in other parts of about one year duration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This disease is considered to recur after a short interval </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The site, type and degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> varied, and therefore <z:hpo ids='HP_0002170'>intracranial hemorrhage</z:hpo> seemed to be caused not only by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> but also by multifactorial hemorrhagic tendency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Transfusion of platelet rich plasma, and administration of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="17754">Glycerol</z:chebi> and steroids produced good results for conservative therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Continuous spinal drainage for <z:hpo ids='HP_0002138'>subarachnoid hemorrhage</z:hpo> was a relatively safe and useful means of management </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the patients who showed precipitous deterioration, the CT scan findings indicated that the high-density-area was diffusely spread with an unclear border, just like "contusional <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp>" </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>For such severe cases, blood evacuation with craniotomy and emergency splenectomy are considered to be valuable </plain></SENT>
