<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Thirty-four cases of CAA were treated by PRP liquid associated with stanozolol, course of 3 week treatment, and control group (17 cases of CAA) was treated by stanozolol alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Effective rate was 85.3% in treatment group, and that of control group was 58.8%, there was significant difference between them (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Symptom remission of treatment group was earlier than that of control group, symptom scoring between two groups, the difference was highly significant (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Blood cell had a distinct elevation after treatment with PRP associated with stanozolol, and had a significant difference in comparing with pre-treatment in treatment group (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Side effect of PRP was not found during treatment of CAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: PRP associated with stanozolol to treat CAA has an additional effect, it can accelerate symptom remission without any additional side effect </plain></SENT>
