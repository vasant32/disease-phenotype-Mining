<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These were the underlying diagnosis and the type of prophylactic regimen used to minimize the risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> had a faster rate of reconstitution of the total white blood cell count to levels of both 500 and 1000 x 10(6)/l than patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> non-lymphoblastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (ANL), <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> (ALL) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (SAA), however, did not show a faster rate of reconstitution of blood neutrophils </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As well as being slower than patients with SAA for total leukocyte reconstitution, patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> were slower than patients with ANL and ALL in attaining a neutrophil count of 500 x 10(6)/l, and slower than patients with ANL in attaining a neutrophil count of 1000 x 10(6)/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients given cyclosporin as the sole <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressant</z:chebi> prophylactic regimen post-transplant had faster reconstitution to total leukocyte counts of 500 and 1000 x 10(6)/l and to neutrophils of 1000 x 10(6)/l than patients given <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> alone, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> and cyclosporin, or cyclosporin and T cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of the donor marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No other factors (including the pretransplant preparative regimen) were significant in influencing the rate of leukocyte or neutrophil reconstitution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When only patients given cyclosporin were analysed, those with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> continued to show a faster rate of leukocyte reconstitution to WBC 500 x 10(6)/l compared to patients with ANL, ALL or <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>, and a faster rate to WBC 1000 x 10(6)/l than patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
