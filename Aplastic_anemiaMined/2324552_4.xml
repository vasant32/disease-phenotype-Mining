<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Using Meg-CSF-enriched fractions, we established that the moiety has the following characteristics: 1) portions of the molecules having Meg-CSF activity have <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26667">sialic acid</z:chebi>, probably with a biantennary structure, and beta-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="28260">galactose</z:chebi> residues as the terminal and penultimate <z:chebi fb="96" ids="16646">sugars</z:chebi>; 2) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48343">disulfide</z:chebi> residues are an essential chemical group of the molecule and are located on its surface; and 3) Meg-CSF activity is stable in n-propanol, but not in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38472">acetonitrile</z:chebi> with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45892">trifluoroacetic acid</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Partial purification of Meg-CSF by a four-step procedure of <z:chebi fb="37" ids="16236,44730">ethanol</z:chebi> precipitation, CM Affi-Gel Blue chromatography, wheat germ agglutinin-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="2511">sepharose</z:chebi> chromatography, and high-resolution <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52254">hydroxyapatite</z:chebi> chromatography, yielded a concentrate with a 430- to 630-fold increase in specific activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The partially purified Meg-CSF fractions stimulated both human and murine megakaryocytopoiesis in vitro (CFU-meg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When analyzed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8984">sodium dodecyl sulfate</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53656">polyacrylamide</z:chebi> gel electrophoresis under nonreduced conditions, Meg-CSF activity was recovered in the 29-34 kDa molecular weight fractions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We have also shown that Meg-CSF, purified from the urine of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> patients, stimulated murine megakaryocytopoiesis and platelet production in vivo </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Final purification of human urinary Meg-CSF is currently in progress </plain></SENT>
