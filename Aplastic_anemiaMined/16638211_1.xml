<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The study was aimed to investigate the action of Panax Notoginosides (PNS, extracted from notoginseng herb) on the expression of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>-related proteins (Daxx, Fas) and transcription factors (NFkB, c-Rel) in the hematopoietic cells and to explore the mechanisms of supporting cells to survive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The colony formation of CFU-GM and CFU-E in human bone marrow was assayed in the presence of various concentrations of PNS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The viability of cells was assayed by trypan blue and the changes of cell <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> were observed with microscope </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The Annexin-V positive cells were detected by FCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three lineages of human myeloid <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60, erythroid K562, megakaryoid CHRF-288 and Meg-01 cells were incubated in addition of PNS (10 mg/L) for 14 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The nuclear or cytoplasm protein of cells was extracted and analyzed by Western blot with monoclonal antibodies against Daxx, Fas or NFkB, c-Rel </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results showed: (1) the proliferation on hematopoietic progenitor cells (CFU-GM and CFU-E) and four cell lines was promoted by PNS; (2) after the four cell lines were promoted by PNS and hungered through wiping off the sera, the viability of the four cell lines was high without significant morphological change and neither the detection of Annexin-V positive cells; (3) the expression of Daxx and Fas protein could be inhibited by PNS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Western Blot showed that Daxx in four cell lines treated by PNS were 33.3-61.5% lower than that in untreated controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The Fas protein was also descended in three cell lines of K562, CHRF-288 and Meg-01 by 33.3-71.4% respectively, while Fas protein in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60 cells was no detectable difference after PNS treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>(4) The transcription factors NFkB and c-Rel protein could be increased by PNS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The NFkB, c-Rel protein were also enhanced in three cell lines of K562, CHRF-288 and Meg-01 by (2.0-2.7) and (1.5-2.3)-fold respectively, while there were also no detectable difference in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">HL</z:e>-60 cells after PNS treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that PNS inhibites the expression of Daxx and Fas proteins, may decrease the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of the hematopoietic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The level of NFkB and c-Rel proteins can be enhanced by PNS, which not only stimulates the proliferation of cells, but also inhibits the activity of the waterfall of caspase and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of the hematopoietic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>PNS may treat the disease with over-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> of hematopoietic cells, as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
