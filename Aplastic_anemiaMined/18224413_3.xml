<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We mailed questionnaires to 454 hospitals with hematology divisions, of which 181 (40%) responded, and the records of 448 patients were collected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patient characteristics, hematological responses, and adverse effects were evaluated in 421 patients with sufficient data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 366 patients had idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA), 29 had other types of AA, and 25 had other diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The response rate (RR) at 6 months was 54% for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, and 53% for those with idiopathic AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Ten patients (2%) died within 30 days, and 11 (3%) died between 31 and 100 days after ATG therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 346 patients with moderate to very severe AA, who received their first ATG therapy, factors that influence the outcomes of ATG therapy were extracted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among 11 pre-treatment and therapy-related variables, three were found to be correlated with a higher RR: shorter duration of AA, no history of specific therapy for AA, and the use of CsA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Most notably, the RR of patients treated within 3 months of diagnosis, those between 3 months and 2 years, and those later than 2 years were 68% (130/190), 48% (54/113), and 13% (5/38), respectively </plain></SENT>
