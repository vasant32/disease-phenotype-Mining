<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The O2(-)-releasing capacity of AA neutrophils (0.85 +/- 0.36 nmol/5 min/1 x 10(5) cells, n = 13) was significantly (p &lt; 0.01) increased as compared with that of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> neutrophils (0.24 +/- 0.12 nmol/5 min/1 x 10(5) cells, n = 17) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>There was no close relationship between the O2(-)-releasing capacity and the peripheral blood neutrophil count or the plasma concentration of C-reactive protein </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The plasma concentrations of G-CSF and GM-CSF were not elevated to the detectable levels (&lt; 0.1 ng/ml and &lt; 0.2 ng/ml, respectively) in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients tested </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The priming effect of rhGM-CSF was consistently greater than that of rhG-CSF in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that neutrophils from AA patients are already primed in vivo for enhanced release of <z:chebi fb="38" ids="18421,29356">O2-</z:chebi> and that these neutrophil functions are further potentiated by rhG-CSF or rhGM-CSF </plain></SENT>
