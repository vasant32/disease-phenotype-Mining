<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Serum of 68 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> was tested for the presence of autolymphocytotoxins (auto-LTs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Prior to specific disease treatment, 16 patients (24%) displayed antibodies cytotoxic to their own lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These antibodies had the characteristics of cold-reactive lymphocytotoxins </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Their detection in patients' sera was found unrelated to a <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> or toxic cause of the disease or the patients' HLA genotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Broadly reactive anti-HLA antibodies were less frequent in pretreatment sera containing auto-LTs, suggesting that these autoantibodies could modulate alloantibody production </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, after specific disease treatment, the alloantibody frequency was comparable in patients with or without auto-LTs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We found no significant difference in response to antilymphocyte serum or bone marrow graft outcome in the patients in relation to the presence or absence of pretreatment auto-LTs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This observation suggests that the detection of these autoantibodies in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> has no clinical relevance </plain></SENT>
