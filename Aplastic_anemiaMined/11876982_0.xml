<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Plasma levels of sFas and sFasL and the expression of Fas antigen on mononuclear cell (MNC) membrane in 32 AA patients and 24 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls were assayed by ELISA and FACS, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The percentage of CD(34)(+)Fas(+) cells was significantly higher (P &lt; 0.05) in AA patients than that in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls, and the percentage of CD(34)(+)Fas(+) cells in severe AA patients was much higher than that in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> AA patients (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The percentage of CD(34)(+)Fas(+) cells was negatively correlated with the course of disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The levels of sFas were significantly lower (P &lt; 0.05) in AA patients than that in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls, and the sFas levels in severe AA were much lower than those in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> AA (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The percentage of CD(34)(+)Fas(+) cells was negatively correlated with sFas level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Fas/FasL system aberration is involved in the pathogenesis of AA </plain></SENT>
