<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Of these, 3858 (32%) were allogeneic, 8243 (68%) autologous transplants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of the autologous transplants 1384 (17%) were bone marrow derived, 6504 (79%) from peripheral blood stem cells and 355 (4%) combined bone marrow and peripheral blood stem cell transplants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the allogeneic transplants, 571 (15%) were peripheral blood stem cell transplants, the remainder, 3287 (85%) bone marrow transplants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Main indications were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> with 4408 transplants (36%), 2977 allogeneic (68%) and 1431 autologous (32%); <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo> with 4671 transplants (39%), 272 allogeneic (6%) and 4399 autologous (94%); severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> with 237 transplants (2%), 237 allogeneic (100%) and 0 autologous (0%); <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0280100" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">solid tumors</z:e> with 2399 transplants (20%), 17 allogeneic (1%) and 2382 autologous (99%); and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242354" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">congenital disorders</z:e> with 294 transplants (2%), 294 allogeneic (100%) and 0 autologous (0%) and others with 92 transplants (1%), 61 allogeneic (66%) and 31 autologous (34%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were major differences between participating countries </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The absolute numbers of teams and transplants per country differ widely and range from 0.2 to 33.3 teams per 10 million inhabitants (median 5.8); 3.2 to 733.3 total transplants per 10 million (median 200); 0.7 to 210 allogeneic transplants per 10 million (median 65); 0.3 to 700 autologous transplants per 10 million (median 122); 0 to 47.7 unrelated transplants per 10 million inhabitants (median 8.7) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There is also a difference in the relative number of transplants for the individual indications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The coefficient of variation for selected diseases was calculated for those 14 countries with a minimum of 100 transplants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A narrow coefficient of variation indicates consensus amongst grafting physicians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>It is narrowest for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> in allogeneic transplants (36.7%) and for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> in autologous transplants (44.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These data reflect the present status of blood and marrow transplantation in Europe and provide a basis for patient counselling and health care planning </plain></SENT>
