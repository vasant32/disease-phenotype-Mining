<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To study the role of immunological factors in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>(AA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Phenotype of T lymphocytes in bone marrow and CFU-GM yields of bone marrow mononuclear cells with or without T cells were assayed with APAAP and semi-solid culture method, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The percentage of lymphocytes in bone marrow of AA patients was higher than that of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls, and the lymphocytes were mainly CD8 and CD25 positive cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Changes of T lymphocyte subsets in peripheral blood of AA patients did not completely reflect the changes in the bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In some AA patients, increased percentage of CD8+ cells was found in bone marrow, while it was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in peripheral blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The CFU-GM yields of bone marrow cells of AA patients were much lower than that of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls, and were markedly improved by removing T cells before culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The abnormalities of cell-mediated immune response played important roles in the pathogenesis of AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The changes of T lymphocytes in bone marrow were more meaningful than that in peripheral blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is suggested that bone marrow T lymphocyte and its subsets should be routinely examined in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the AA patients diagnosed so as to assess the indication and predict the effectiveness of immunosuppresive therapy </plain></SENT>
