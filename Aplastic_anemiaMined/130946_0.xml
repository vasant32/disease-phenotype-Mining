<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The capacity of leukocytes from 28 of 53 patients to stimulate was diminished or absent, wheras their ability to respond remained comparable to that of cells from their HLA-identical siblings </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Leukocytes from the group of patients with the lowest peripheral lymphocyte count were least stimulatory </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results indicate that in acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> there exists a dissociation between stimulation and response in mixed culture </plain></SENT>
