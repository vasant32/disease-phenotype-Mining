<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The U6(+) 27 promoter cassette and siFas sequence were obtained by PCR method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The U6-siFas fragment was cloned into the multiple restriction site of pLXSN-EGFP and directly downstream of EGFP gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The resultant retroviral vector pLXSN/EGFP-siFas was packaged using PA317 cell line and tittered using NIH3T3 cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>P815 cells were infected by the retroviral vector </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>EGFP expression in P815 was observed under fluorescent microscope and Fas inhibition effect was detected by immunohistochemistry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The results indicated that successfully constructed retrovirus vector pLXSN/EGFP-siFas was could not only deliver siRNA into mammalian cells efficiently and inhibit Fas expression in P815 cells, but also could express EGFP as marker and neomycine resistance gene to allow antibiotic selection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the successful construction of this retroviral vector would greatly facilitate the application of <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> interference and lay the foundation for therapeutic study of Fas inhibition in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
