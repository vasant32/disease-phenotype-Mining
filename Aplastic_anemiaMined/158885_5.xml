<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Prior to therapy his peripheral blood contained a very low number of myeloid progenitors but a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> number of cells forming lymphoid colonies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Moreover, peripheral blood lymphocytes of this patient were able to suppress in vitro formation of myeloid colonies but not lymphoid colonies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This suppression effect was found to be sensitive to <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> and antithymocytic globulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Following treatment with <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi>, during which an apparent hematological recovery was observed, the level of lymphoid progenitors fell, but myeloid committed cells returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and hematopoietic suppression was no longer detectable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that cells suppressing hematopoiesis may circulate in the peripheral blood of some patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and the detection and testing of suceptibility of these cells to immunosuppressive drugs may be helpful in monitoring treatment and prognosis </plain></SENT>
