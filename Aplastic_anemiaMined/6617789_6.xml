<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AA developed after 2 weeks to 6 months in selected strain combinations used and usually 60 to 90% of the mice died </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Clinical signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> did not occur and <z:mp ids='MP_0003643'>splenic atrophy</z:mp> rather than <z:hpo ids='HP_0001744'>splenomegaly</z:hpo> was the rule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Histologically these mice had a lesion of the hematopoietic microenvironment characterized by sinusoidal injury and stromal <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Others have demonstrated injury to hematopoietic stem cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>C3H/He LNC induced AA whereas C3H/HeJ LNC failed to induce AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The C3H/HeJ strain carries a macrophage defect and these results suggest that a macrophage-like cell may be a mediator of immunological injury in this experimental model </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> strain combinations evaluated were H-2k identical and Mls mismatched, certain Mls combinations resulted in AA and identical Mls mismatched but different strains did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both strong (Mlsd) and weak (Mlsc) stimulating LNC induce AA but simple Mls differences do not explain the AA as similar Mls combinations but different strain combinations fail to induce AA </plain></SENT>
