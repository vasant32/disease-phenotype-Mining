<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We herein hypothesized that the polymorphisms of TBX21 and STAT4 genes might contribute to the susceptibility of Chinese individuals to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) as T cell-mediated <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021053" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">immune disease</z:e> characterized by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We investigated the distributions of TBX21 (T-1993C and T-1514C) and STAT4 (rs7574862) polymorphisms in 202 adult patients with AA and 195 healthy controls by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The frequencies of T-1993C (but not T-1514C) genotype and allele distribution were significantly higher in AA patients than in controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The T allele (TT + TG genotypes) of STAT4 variant rs7574865 was associated with increased susceptibility of Chinese people to AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our results indicated that single nucleotide polymorphisms in TBX21 and STAT4 might contribute to susceptibility to AA in the Chinese population </plain></SENT>
