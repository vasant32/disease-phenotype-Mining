<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>After 8 weeks <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft versus host disease</z:e> (GVHD) developed and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After in vitro restimulation and following limiting dilution cloning, 15 proliferative (PLT) and 25 cytolytic (CTL) T cell lines specific for host PBMC but unreactive to donor PBMC were isolated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Only 1 of 10 clones which could be expanded sufficiently for testing recognized a target cell (haploidentical sister), and in only 4 instances could a restriction element be found in a panel study (3 times HLA-A2; once HLA-BW49) of 13 unrelated stimulators </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the 8 CTL clones testable after expansion, none showed a clear restriction and none recognized any of the family cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our data demonstrate that anti-patient reactive PLT and CTL lines can be found in PBMC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In no instance was segregation with HLA found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only HLA-class I restriction was detectable </plain></SENT>
