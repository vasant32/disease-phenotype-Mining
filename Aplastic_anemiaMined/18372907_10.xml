<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We reviewed the medical records of 24 consecutive patients treated with BMT for acquired AA using two different GVHD prevention strategies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ten patients were given alemtuzumab-based GVHD prophylaxis (50-60 mg in three divided doses on days -8, -7 and -6), and 14 patients were given conventional GVHD prophylaxis with calcineurin inhibitors plus MTX before the introduction of the alemtuzumab-based protocols </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> and 'serious GVHD' was significantly reduced in alemtuzumab-treated patients compared to conventionally treated patients [11 vs 64% (P=0.03), 0 vs 78% (P=0.002) and 0 vs 57% (P=0.007), respectively] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Engraftment time and rates of graft failure appeared similar in the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A significantly higher proportion of alemtuzumab-treated patients developed CMV reactivation compared to control patients (83 vs 12%; P=0.03); none developed CMV disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The rates of other infectious complications did not appear significantly different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that 50-60 mg of alemtuzumab given according to the current schedule significantly reduces the risk of GVHD without increasing the risk of graft failure or serious <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> </plain></SENT>
