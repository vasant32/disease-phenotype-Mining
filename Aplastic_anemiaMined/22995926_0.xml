<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there are limited reports on BSI after HSCT in pediatric patients in multiple centers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study was a retrospective cohort analysis of consecutive patients who underwent allogeneic and autologous HSCT at the Department of Paediatrics, Hokkaido University Hospital, between 1988 and 2009; the Department of Paediatrics, Sapporo Hokuyu Hospital, between 2007 and 2009; and the Department of Paediatrics, Asahikawa Medical University, between 1989 and 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 277 patients underwent HSCT during the study period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this multicenter analysis, cases of BSI after HSCT were recorded in the early posttransplant period (within the first 100 d), and BSI was observed in 24 of 277 HSCT patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis showed that nonmalignant disease was an independent factor associated with BSI after HSCT (hazard ratio 6.3 for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043194" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome</z:e> patients; confidence interval, 1.4-12.8; P = 0.012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0043194" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome</z:e> were the novel risk factors for BSI in pediatric patients after HSCT </plain></SENT>
