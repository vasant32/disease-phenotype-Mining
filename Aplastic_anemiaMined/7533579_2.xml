<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Ten patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) and seven patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> (RA) were treated with recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF) and erythropoietin (rhEpo) in combination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>rhG-CSF (5-20 micrograms/kg) and rhEpo (120-720 U/kg) were administered by s.c. injection three times a week for at least six months, and the administration was continued as maintenance therapy for as long as possible when hematological responses were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Six (60%) of the ten AA patients and four (58%) of the seven RA patients showed multilineage responses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of these responders, six patients achieved trilineage recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>While <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the responders were dependent on red blood cell transfusions and eight of them required platelet transfusions before treatment, they now no longer need transfusions of either red blood cells or platelets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A median treatment duration of 9 (range 1 to 28) months was required to achieve multilineage recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The responders showed an ability to maintain the multilineage recovery for 9+ to 47+ months and to tolerate long-term treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that the long-term treatment with rhG-CSF and rhEpo may benefit a substantial percentage of patients with AA and RA and provide an optional therapy for these patients </plain></SENT>
