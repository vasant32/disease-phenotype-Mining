<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Unexpected unidirectional reactivity was noted in MLC by the cells of an untransfused patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> against cells from her genotypically HLA identical brother </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To analyze this reactivity, lymphocytes from the patient were primed in vitro for six days with irradiated lymphocytes from the HLA identical brother and then cloned by limiting dilution in the presence of interleukin-2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Following a period of clonal expansion, the patient's cells were tested for specific proliferative (PLT) and cytolytic (CTL) activity against cells of the brother </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty-six clones demonstrated proliferative activity, 30 clones demonstrated cytolytic activity, and 114 clones showed neither </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No clone demonstrated both cytotoxic and proliferative activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Several patterns of specificity were seen for the cytolytic T cell (CTL) clones, including both allo- and autoreactivity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two distinct patterns of specificity were noted for the proliferative clones: one reactive to cells from DR3-positive males; the other reactive only to cells from certain DR2-positive males and females </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The DR3-restricted clones are presumably directed towards the H-Y minor histocompatibility antigen while the DR2-restricted clones are directed toward an undefined minor histocompatibility antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It is thus possible to isolate both alloreactive and autoreactive T cells from the peripheral blood of some untransfused patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
