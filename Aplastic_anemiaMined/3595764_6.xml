<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MK were cultured in the presence of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human AB serum (NABS) to mimic "<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>" development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The rate of maturation was not statistically altered by higher concentrations (10%-20%-30%) of NABS, or by the addition of bovine serum albumin (1.5%-3.0%), but was accelerated in the presence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> serum (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AAS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sera from eight different patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> were effective in accelerating terminal differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>MK-CSF, a <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> isolated from <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AAS</z:e>, specifically augments MK colony formation by two- to sixfold </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Similar doses of MK-CSF were ineffective in altering terminal cytoplasmic maturation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Anti-MK-CSF, a polyclonal antibody prepared against purified MK-CSF, neutralizes the ability of both purified MK-CSF and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AAS</z:e> to promote MK colony formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AAS</z:e> adsorbed with anti-MK-CSF still retained its ability to accelerate terminal differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Apparently, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AAS</z:e> contains at least two separate humoral factors, which can regulate in vitro human megakaryocytopoiesis: MK-CSF, which stimulates proliferation of the progenitors (CFU-MK), and a maturation factor, which accelerates cytoplasmic maturation of morphologically recognizable megakaryocytes </plain></SENT>
