<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this phase I trial, rhIL-1 beta (0.02-0.50 microgram/kg) was administered by 30-minute intravenous infusion once daily for 2 or 5 consecutive days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The dose was escalated with the subsequent cycle in the same patient if no hematologic response was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nineteen patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> received 60 courses of IL-1 beta </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Diagnoses included autologous bone marrow transplant (BMT) (n = 5), allogeneic BMT (n = 7) or idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (n = 6) and 1 patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Toxicities included <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> (89%), chills (85%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0000822'>hypertension</z:hpo> (89%), <z:hpo ids='HP_0002615'>hypotension</z:hpo> (57%) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo> (95%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No complications were life-threatening and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> either spontaneously resolved or were managed pharmacologically </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In 8 of 19 patients there was an <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo>, transient increase in neutrophil counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In 2 patients there was a transient increase in platelet count; however, no durable, clinically significant effects on peripheral blood counts were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, administration of rhIL-1 beta in this population of patients had limited efficacy and moderate toxicity </plain></SENT>
