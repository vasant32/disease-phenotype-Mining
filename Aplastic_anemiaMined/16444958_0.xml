<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The response rate of salvage IST was 61.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overall survival at 10 years was 84.0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Failure-free survival at 10 years was 62.0% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Clonal or malignant diseases developed in 2 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> due to <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> were observed only in elderly patients </plain></SENT>
