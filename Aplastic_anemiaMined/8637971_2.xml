<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A 41-year-old woman with a five-year history of SLE treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> was admitted to Cabrini Medical Center in New York </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The patient complained of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo>, chills, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002829'>arthralgias</z:hpo>, general malaise, <z:mp ids='MP_0000746'>weakness</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002094'>dyspnea</z:hpo> on exertion, and showed malar <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015230" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">rash</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000980'>pallor</z:hpo>, and a systolic ejection murmur along the left sternal border </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Admission work up included a CBC with evidence of moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo>, a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> EKG, and a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> chest X-ray </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient's <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> was symptomatic and required a transfusion of packed red blood cells (PRBC's) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow biopsy and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> revealed an <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1368107" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aplastic marrow</z:e> with few hypoplastic islands of hematopoietic elements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patient was treated with plasmapheresis, achieving immediate progress towards recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow culture studies (erythroid BFU-E, and myeloid CFU-GM) were done by incubating various titers of the patient's <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase plasma with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This was done to determine if the patient's plasma contained any hematopoietic inhibitory activity, as has been reported in other cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our experiments demonstrated marked inhibition of erymathropoiesis and myelopoiesis in vitro, when various titers of the patient's plasma were included in the culture media </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Control plasma produced no inhibition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These studies support the hypothesis that a circulating antibody which inhibits hematopoiesis may be produced in SLE patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, and be responsible for it </plain></SENT>
