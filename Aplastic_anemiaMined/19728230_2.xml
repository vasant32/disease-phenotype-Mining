<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Immunohematological studies did not show any abnormality and blood cultures from patients and blood bags were negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The ultrastructural findings, allied with current scientific knowledge, permitted the diagnosis of Bartonella sp. <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In face of this diagnosis, two possibilities should be considered: the first one is that the patient was already infected by the bacteria before the last RBC unit transfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The pathogen could be involved in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> etiology and in the failure to recover <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> levels, in spite of the transfusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The second possibility is that the RBC unit was contaminated with a Bartonella sp., which would have led to a state of shock, causing the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of the patient </plain></SENT>
