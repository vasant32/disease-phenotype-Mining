<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mutations in the FANCC gene account for 10-15% of cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>FA cells are abnormally sensitive to DNA-damaging agents such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27504">mitomycin C</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="172" ids="27504">MMC</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Transfection of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> FANCC into mutant cells corrects this hypersensitivity and improves their viability in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Four FA patients, representing the three major FANCC mutation subgroups, were entered into a clinical trial of gene transduction aimed at correction of the hematopoietic defect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three patients received three or four cycles of gene transfer, each consisting of one or two infusions of autologous hematopoietic progenitor cells that had been transduced ex vivo with a retroviral vector carrying the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> FANCC gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Prior to infusion, the FANCC transgene was demonstrated in transduced CD34-enriched progenitor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After infusion, FANCC was also present transiently in peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Function of the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> FANCC transgene was suggested by a marked increase in hematopoietic colonies measured by in vitro cultures, including colonies grown in the presence of <z:chebi fb="172" ids="27504">MMC</z:chebi>, after successive gene therapy cycles in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Transient improvement in BM cellularity coincided with this expansion of hematopoietic progenitors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A fourth patient, who received a single infusion of transduced CD34-enriched BM cells, was given radiation therapy for a concurrent gynecologic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The FANCC transgene was detected in her PB and BM cells only after recovery from radiation-induced <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath>, suggesting that FANCC gene transduction confers a selective engraftment advantage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>These experiments highlight both the potential and difficulties in applying gene therapy to FA </plain></SENT>
