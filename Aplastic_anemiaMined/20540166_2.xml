<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The characteristics and clinical outcome of 600 adult patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) that had successful cytogenetic studies at the time of diagnosis were retrospectively evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among these, 572 (95.3%) had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cytogenetics and 28 (4.7%) had abnormal cytogenetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The most frequent abnormality was <z:mp ids='MP_0004027'>trisomy</z:mp> 8 (n = 15), followed by <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7/deletion of 7q (n = 5), and deletion of 1q (n = 5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>There were no statistically significant differences with respect to gender, <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0004818'>paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</z:hpo>, or severity of disease between the patients in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and abnormal cytogenetics groups; however, the patients with abnormal cytogenetics were generally younger than those with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cytogenetics (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Abnormal cytogenetics was associated with a higher cumulative leukemic transformation rate (P &lt; 0.001) and lower leukemic transformation-free survival (P = 0.021) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, abnormal cytogenetics was an independent predictor of a poor response to immunosuppressive therapy (HR = 0.255; 95% CI = 0.077-0.839; P = 0.024) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These analyses suggest that patients with AA and abnormal cytogenetics have different clinical characteristics compared to patients with AA and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cytogenetics </plain></SENT>
