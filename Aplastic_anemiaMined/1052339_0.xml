<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>20.10(6) lymph node cells of a Wistar rat, sensitized against mouse liver antigens 10--15 days prior to the transplantation, during first 24 hrs after birth was studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:mp ids='MP_0001265'>runt</z:mp> disease developed in 100% recipients and was characterized by sharp disturbances of the formation of immuno- and hemopoietic systems </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> <z:mp ids='MP_0001265'>runting</z:mp> animals suffered from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001882'>leukopenia</z:hpo> with predominance of hyperlobular neutrophils and histio-monocytes in the peripheral blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The total number of cells in bone marrow decreased almost 15 times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The elimination of erythroid line was coupled with relative augmentation of undifferentiated myeloid and monocytoid cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The cellular pool of spleen increased twice and more </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The intensive proliferation of histio-monocytes and macrophages was accompanied by the destruction and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of lymphatic structures </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A suggestion is put forward to the effect that the incorporation of "not-self" genetic information, such as non-syngeneic lymphocytes, during the early postnatal period may not only induced some genuine immunological effects, but inhibit the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> way of differentiation in proliferating cell systems due to the lack of their mutual adaptation as well </plain></SENT>
