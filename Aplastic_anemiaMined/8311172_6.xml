<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>PURPOSE: The two major factors associated with lack of survival after allogeneic marrow transplant for severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> have been graft rejection and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft versus host disease</z:e> (GVHD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As a result, survival for patients transplanted in the 1970s was approximately 68% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Improved survival during the 1980s was primarily related to the decrease in the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD with the use of combination <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> for GVHD prophylaxis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although the incidence of graft rejection has not changed, the time to graft rejection has been delayed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred forty children &lt; 18 years of age received a marrow transplant for severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> at the Fred Hutchinson <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Research Center between May, 1971 and June, 1991 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Four recipients of syngeneic marrow received a simple marrow infusion, 119 recipients of HLA-identical family member marrow received <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (CY), 200 mg/kg; most recipients of alternative donor marrow received CY plus 12.0 Gy fractionated total body irradiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>GVHD prophylaxis was MTX only for 91 recipients of HLA-identical family member marrow, and was MTX plus CSP for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> other allogeneic marrow patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Estimates of graft rejection, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD, survival and event-free survival (EFS) were determined by the Kaplan-Meier method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Two recipients of syngeneic marrow achieved engraftment with donor marrow infusion only and two required immunosuppression with CY </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among the 119 recipients of HLA-identical family member marrow the type of GVHD prophylaxis did not influence graft rejection but non-transfused patients had 10% incidence of rejection compared to 22% for transfused patients (p = 0.1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients with late graft rejection survive whereas those with early rejection usually do not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD was 27% and 11% for MTX recipients and MTX plus CSP recipients, respectively (p = 0.11), and the probability of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD was 30% and 26%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Survival is 64% for recipients of MTX and 96% for recipients of MTX plus CSP (p = 0.007), but EFS was 60% and 71%, respectively (p = 0.48) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Recipients of partially matched family member or unrelated marrow donor grafts have transplants complicated by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> and GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Growth and development of CY only recipients is <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and several children have been born to these former patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: High dose CY is usually an effective preparative regimen for children with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and an HLA-identical family member marrow donor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Additional immunosuppression with anti-thymocyte globulin may result in a further decrease in graft rejection and improved EFS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Identification of a group of children who are unlikely to respond to immunosuppressive treatment could permit earlier transplantation for patients without HLA-identical family member donors available </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Children who receive CY only have <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> growth and development </plain></SENT>
