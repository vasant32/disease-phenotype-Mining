<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Serum ferritin analysis was performed before and after BMT at monthly intervals and/or according to the clinical condition of the patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serum ferritin increased considerably during the first 3 months following BMT and then decreased in patients with an uncomplicated course </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Ferritin levels in the serum of patients who had undergone BMT decreased gradually when complete remission was achieved, but increased with any clinical complication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Thus, elevation of serum ferritin concentration was predictable for clinical complications and for relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> with serum ferritin levels above 400 micrograms/l at time of BMT had a risk of relapse within 1 year, triple that patients with lower ferritin levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients who underwent BMT to treat severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> have completely recovered </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Accordingly, following an initial increase after BMT, serum ferritin levels returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> and remained so in line with the patients' good clinical condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The findings indicate that serum ferritin yields useful information in the clinical evaluation of patients undergoing BMT </plain></SENT>
