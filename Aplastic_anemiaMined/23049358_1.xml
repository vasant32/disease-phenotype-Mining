<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Secondary myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> comprise a group of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0277555" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">secondary diseases</z:e> following exposure to myelotoxic agents or due to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0242354" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">congenital diseases</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The improvement of anticancer agents and immunosuppressive drugs seem to be associated with an increased incidence of secondary myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Karyotyping of bone marrow is essential for diagnosis and prognosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Previous use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="22333">alkylating agents</z:chebi> and radiation are associated with clonal abnormalities such as recurrent unbalanced -5/5q-, -7/7q- and complex karyotypes, whereas <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50750">topoisomerase-II inhibitors</z:chebi> lead to changes such as the balanced 11q23 rearrangement, t(8;21), t(15;17) and inv(16) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To study the clinical and cytogenetic data of patients with secondary myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> who took <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35610">antineoplastic</z:chebi> and/or immunosuppressive drugs or progressed from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The clinical and cytogenetic characteristics of 42 patients diagnosed with secondary myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> in one institution were retrospectively evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of these, 25, 11 and 6 patients had had oncological diseases, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and other diseases, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Conventional cytogenetic and FISH analyses were performed for <z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>monosomy</z:mp> 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The cytogenetic study was conclusive in 32 cases with 84.4% of clonal abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>Monosomy</z:mp> 7 and complex karyotypes were present in 44.4% and 37%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A high prevalence of unbalanced abnormalities (96.3%) was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0004026'>Monosomy</z:mp> 7 was more prevalent in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo>/myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> after <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (66.6%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The median survival after diagnosis of myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> was only 5.7 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> cytogenetics was associated to better survival (p-value = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>There was a slightly worse trend of survival for patients with complex karyotypes (p-value = 0.057) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Abnormal karyotype was an independent risk factor for poor survival (p-value = 0.012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: This study enhances the importance of cytogenetic analysis of patients at the time of diagnosis of secondary myeloid <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasms</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
