<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, some chemicals documented in only a few cases to possess only a possibility of toxic potential may also be responsible for the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This report presents a case of a string musician with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient used a certain type of polish (komalak) to shine his musical instrument and did this frequently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>He presented with nasal <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp>, and a workup on admission revealed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>Aplastic anemia</z:hpo> was diagnosed on the basis of bone marrow histology results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An analysis for gene polymorphism related to the metabolic detoxification enzymes <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi> S-transferase and N-acetyltransferase 2 indicated that the patient was genetically susceptible to developing toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This case suggests that frequent use of this polish may cause a toxic effect that leads to <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Musicians should be made aware of the risks associated with these types of chemicals </plain></SENT>
