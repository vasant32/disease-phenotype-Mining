<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This European survey included 840 patients who received a first-line IST with (43%) or without (57%) G-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The incidences of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> in patients who did or did not receive G-CSF were 10.9% and 5.8%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A significantly higher hazard (1.9) of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>/<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> was associated with use of G-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Relapse of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> was not associated with a worse outcome in patients who did not receive G-CSF as first therapy, whereas relapse was associated with a significantly worse outcome in those patients who received G-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results emphasize the necessity of the current European randomized trial comparing IST with or without G-CSF and to alert physicians that adding G-CSF to IST is currently not standard treatment for SAA </plain></SENT>
