<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, which is characterized by immune-mediated <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow hypoplasia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo>, can be treated effectively with immunosuppressive therapy or allogeneic transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One third of patients have disease that is refractory to immunosuppression, with persistent, severe cytopenia and a profound deficit in hematopoietic stem cells and progenitor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thrombopoietin may increase the number of hematopoietic stem cells and progenitor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We conducted a phase 2 study involving patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> that was refractory to immunosuppression to determine whether the oral thrombopoietin mimetic eltrombopag (Promacta) can improve blood counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-five patients received eltrombopag at a dose of 50 mg, which could be increased, as needed, to a maximum dose of 150 mg daily, for a total of 12 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Primary end points were clinically significant changes in blood counts or transfusion independence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients with a response continued to receive eltrombopag </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eleven of 25 patients (44%) had a hematologic response in at least one lineage at 12 weeks, with minimal toxic effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Nine patients no longer needed platelet transfusions (median increase in platelet count, 44,000 per cubic millimeter) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Six patients had improved <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> levels (median increase, 4.4 g per deciliter); 3 of them were previously dependent on red-cell transfusions and no longer needed transfusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Nine patients had <z:mp ids='MP_0000219'>increased neutrophil counts</z:mp> (median increase, 1350 per cubic millimeter) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Serial bone marrow biopsies showed normalization of trilineage hematopoiesis in patients who had a response, without increased <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Monitoring of immune function revealed no consistent changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with eltrombopag was associated with multilineage clinical responses in some patients with refractory severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
