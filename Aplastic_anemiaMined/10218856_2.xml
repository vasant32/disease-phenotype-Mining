<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Preparative therapy was <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (CY) 200 mg/kg over 4 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>GVHD prophylaxis was with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> (CsA) for a year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After an 8 year follow-up during which the patient was well with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> blood counts, graft failure occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>At this time marrow chimerism studies demonstrated that 85% of hemopoiesis was of recipient origin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The patient was re-engrafted from the same donor after conditioning with CY 200 mg/kg over 4 days plus rabbit antithymocyte globulin (ATG) 3.5 mg/kg/day for 3 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After 140 days follow-up he has a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> blood count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The possible causes of the graft failure are discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This case demonstrates that, although rarely, very late graft failure may occur after BMT for AA and highlights the need for long-term monitoring even in apparently successfully transplanted patients </plain></SENT>
