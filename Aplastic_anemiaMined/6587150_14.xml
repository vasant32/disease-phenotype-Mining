<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Farmers had significantly elevated risks of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153340" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer of the lip</z:e> (PMR = 191, P = .05), stomach (PMR = 119, P less than .0001), and prostate gland (PMR = 113, P less than .001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In addition, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> was higher than expected (PMR = 122, P less than .01), as was <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (PMR = 174, P less than .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The elevated risks were fairly consistent over the 29-year period for stomach, prostate gland, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0153340" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">lip cancer</z:e>, as well as for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The PMR for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> was highest for the years 1950-59 and declined over the next 19 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Farmers also showed significant mortality deficits for several important <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> sites, including esophagus (PMR = 59, P less than .0001), colon (PMR = 84, P less than .001), larynx (PMR = 62, P less than .01), and lung (PMR = 66, P less than .0001) for the period 1950-78 </plain></SENT>
