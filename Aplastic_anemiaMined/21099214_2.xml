<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the treatment efficacy and tolerance of anti-human T lymphocyte porcine immunoglobulin (p-ALG) plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> A (CsA) in acquired severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (SAA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Forty-eight SAA patients [31 males and 17 females; 17 with very SAA (VSAA)] were treated with p-ALG plus CsA and were analyzed retrospectively according to early mortality, response rate and quality, survival rate, toxicity, and complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>They were stratified further by gender, age, disease severity, interval from diagnosis to treatment, and preexisting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULT: The median age was 28 years (range 13-64) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The interval from diagnosis to treatment was 45 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The median neutrophil count was 0.178 × 10⁹/l </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The overall response was 83.3% (54.2% complete and 29.2% partial) with a 90-day median time (range 23-380), and 10.4% died of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> within 30 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The 1.5-year survival was 87.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>vSAA patients had less response, a higher early mortality, and less survival (64.7, 29.4, 51.8%) compared to SAA patients (93.5, 0, and 100%, respectively; p &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Groups with different age, gender, intervals between diagnosis and treatment, and preexisting <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> had the same response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Mild toxicities were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: p-ALG plus CsA is a reliable and well-tolerated treatment for SAA, and it has the great advantage of a much lower cost compared to horse/rabbit ATG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>VSAA was a poor predictive factor for the response rate </plain></SENT>
