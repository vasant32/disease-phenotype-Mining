<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Measurements of plasma glycocalicin (GC) and reticulated platelets (RP) have been reported to be useful for classifying <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0040034" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombocytopenic disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there have been no reports comparing the clinical usefulness of the two methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We measured GC and RP levels simultaneously in 39 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001973'>idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi>), 15 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA), and 17 patients with hypoplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> (HypoT) due to chemotherapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The GC index (GC level normalized for the individual platelet count) and the percentage of RP (%RP), a parameter of platelet life span, were very high (7.5 +/- 11.4 and 20.8 +/- 13.0%, respectively) in patients with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> as compared with those of healthy subjects (1.3 +/- 0.5 and 7.9 +/- 2.5%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, 6 AA patients and 14 HypoT patients, in whom platelet life span is thought to be <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, also had an elevated GC index, suggestive of a false positive result </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The RP, a parameter of platelet production, was low in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> AA and HypoT patients except for one in each case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the GC level, an additional parameter of platelet production, was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in 4 AA and 8 HypoT patients, indicating that it is not a sensitive indicator </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the RP and %RP are more feasible markers of thrombopoiesis and platelet life span, respectively, than the GC level and GC index </plain></SENT>
