<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036830" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">serum sickness</z:e> has been described with the use of ATG, few cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> intravascular <z:mp ids='MP_0010163'>hemolysis</z:mp> have been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report a case of apparent ATG-related <z:mp ids='MP_0010163'>hemolysis</z:mp> in a patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and a <z:hpo ids='HP_0004818'>paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>) clone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CASE REPORT: A 62-year-old, group A, RhoD+ man with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and an 11.6 percent <z:chebi fb="0" ids="24410">glycosylphosphatidylinositol</z:chebi> (GPI)-anchored protein-negative population of red cells (RBCs), representing approximately 190 mL of his RBC volume, and 90 percent GPI-negative neutrophils were scheduled to receive equine ATG at 40 mg per kg per day for 4 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After the first infusion, he developed a 1.6 g per dL decline in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> concentration and an increase in serum <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>, 113-226 U/L) from 284 to 1127 U per L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The hemolytic process was complicated by <z:hpo ids='HP_0001919'>acute renal failure</z:hpo> characterized by an increase in serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16737">creatinine</z:chebi> from 0.9 to 4.2 mg per dL and the appearance of dark-colored urine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Pre- and post-ATG direct antiglobulin tests were negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The temporal association of intravenous ATG to lysis of complement-sensitive RBCs suggests a causal relationship </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although intravascular <z:mp ids='MP_0010163'>hemolysis</z:mp> after ATG administration appears to be uncommon, the clinical consequences may be severe, and determining the pathophysiology may yield clues to the mechanism of intravascular <z:mp ids='MP_0010163'>hemolysis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
