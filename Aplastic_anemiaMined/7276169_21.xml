<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have recently described an assay system for human peripheral blood megakaryocyte colony-forming unit cells (CFU-M) using an anti-platelet <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> antiserum probe to define megakaryocyte colonies grown in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This system was applied to study the nature and regulation of human bone marrow CFU-M </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the absence of a specific megakaryocyte growth-promoting factor, 12.4 +/- 3.0 (means +/- <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SEM</z:e>) megakaryocyte colonies were cloned per 5 X 10(5) cells cultured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Colonies were present after 6 d of incubation reaching peak numbers between days 10 and 14 and slowly decreasing thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Erythropoietin in concentrations of up to 4 U/ml failed to augment colony numbers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Also failing to enhance megakaryocyte colony plating efficiency were media containing burst-promoting activity and colony-stimulating activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A medium conditioned by human embryonic kidney cells, which has been previously demonstrated to contain thrombopoietin, also had no effect on megakaryocyte colony numbers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, sera from three patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> produced significant enhancement of CFU-M-derived colony formation in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both the number of megakaryocyte colonies present and the number of megakaryocytes per colony were increased in proportion to the final concentration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the presence of 10% <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> serum, cultured megakaryocyte colony numbers were linear with respect to the number of bone marrow mononuclear cells plated suggesting a clonal origin of each of the colonies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This in vitro assay for bone marrow CFU-M is a reliable means by which to study the regulation of human megakaryocytopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Initial data suggest that megakaryocyte production is stimulated by a factor detectable in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> serum that may be distinct from other known hematopoietic stem cell regulators </plain></SENT>
