<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: T lymphocyte subsets and HLA-DR antigen expression in the peripheral blood cells were assayed, and the levels of G-CSF, IL-6, TNF alpha, IFN alpha and IL-8 in the PBMNC culture supernatants were determined in 38 AA patients and 20 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control with APAAP and ELISA methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CD4+ cells, CD4+/CD8+ cells and G-CSF level were lower, and CD8+ cells, HLA-DR+ cells and IL-6, TNF alpha, IFN alpha and IL-8 levels were higher in AA patients than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The level of G-CSF was positively correlated with CD4+ cells and CD4+/CD8+ cells and negatively with IFN alpha level </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IL-6 level was negatively correlated with WBC count and CD4+ cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>TNF alpha level was positively correlated with CD8+ cells and negatively with CD4+/CD8+ cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>IL-8 level was positively correlated with CD8+ cells and HLA-DR+ cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The cellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021053" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">immune dysfunction</z:e> and cytokine aberration participate in the pathogenesis of AA </plain></SENT>
