<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Nineteen patients are alive with a follow-up of 4 to 25 months; three patients died of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> and one of a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002239'>gastrointestinal hemorrhage</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Within 3 months, improvement of hematopoiesis was seen in 14 patients (61%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>First signs of a response after 23 to 88 days were followed by complete remission in eight patients, partial remission in three patients, and minimal improvement in three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two of the patients with only minimal improvement were treated with a second course of immunosuppression and reached a complete remission and partial remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, remission proved to be dependent on the continued administration of CsA in four of five patients with partial or complete remission who could be evaluated up to now </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, CsA must have been effective in the induction and/or maintenance of remission in three patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This observation is a very strong argument for the role of T cells in the pathogenesis of at least some cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and warrants further evaluation of the role of CsA in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
