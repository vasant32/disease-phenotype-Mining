<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PN was used in 65% of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, regardless of age, sex, type of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, remission status, irradiation schedule, laminar air flow isolation and donor sex match, required more frequent and more prolonged PN than patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Children required PN most often for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001508'>failure to thrive</z:hpo> and adults for <z:hpo ids='HP_0010280'>stomatitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in frequency or duration of PN among 24 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> randomized to receive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> therapy and among 28 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006721'>acute lymphoblastic leukemia</z:hpo> randomized to interferon or no interferon </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We conclude that outpatient PN presents a valuable addition to posttransplant supportive care </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It shortens the duration of hospitalization both by earlier discharge of patients still requiring PN and by avoiding readmission to the hospital for the purpose of PN </plain></SENT>
