<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This leads to reduced cell longevity with maximal impact on tissues with high proliferate potential </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to establish the role of TERC in the pathophysiology of uncharacterized patients with AA with some features of DC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: The TERC gene was screened for mutations by denaturing high performance liquid chromatography </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>To determine the functional significance of TERC mutations telomerase activity was assessed in an in vitro (TRAP) assay and telomere length of patients' samples was determined using Southern blot analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS This study led to the identification of four novel TERC mutations (G178A, C180T, D52-86 and G2C) and a recurrent TERC mutation (D110-113GACT) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Two of the de novo TERC mutations (G178A and C180T) found uniquely produce a clinical phenotype in the first generation, differing from previously published cases in which individuals in the first generation are usually asymptomatic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Curiously these mutations are located near the triple-helix domain of TERC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We also observed that the recurrent D110-113GACT can present with AA, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The D52-86 is associated with varied phenotypes including <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024115" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary disease</z:e> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0002206'>pulmonary fibrosis</z:hpo>) as the first presentation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In summary, this study reports the functional characterization of several novel TERC mutations associated with varied hematologic and extra-hematologic presentations </plain></SENT>
