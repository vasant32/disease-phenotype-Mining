<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There exists a large residual pool of patients who have not been able to benefit from these modalities because of 1) lack of compatible siblings, 2) age, 3) duration of illness prior to diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Historically oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35509">androstanes</z:chebi> have been helpful in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The long-range survival in large cooperative groups of patients treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35509">androstanes</z:chebi> have indicated that both severe and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> have had responses similar to immune suppressive therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There is a need to have further investigations to seek the most effective <z:chebi fb="0" ids="36413">anabolic agents</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Many group studies have shortened treatment schedules when an erythropoietic response has been obtained, rather than continue therapy until the maximum platelet count is achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Such abbreviation of therapy may hasten a hematological relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Clinics also should evaluate parenteral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35509">androstanes</z:chebi> since they appear to be more hematopoietic </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Also the investigation of different <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35509">androstane</z:chebi> metabolites, i.e. <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28195">etiocholanolone</z:chebi>, should be pursued to determined if a more effective stimulus of stem cell proliferation can be achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In the recovery phase of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> patients treated with immune suppression or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35509">androstanes</z:chebi> the peripheral blood reflects an altered proliferation of the marrow stem cell </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The majority of these patients continue to have abnormalities in red cells (<z:mp ids='MP_0000248'>macrocytosis</z:mp>) and decreased platelet size </plain></SENT>
