<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The objective of this study was to investigate the ultrastructural characteristics of nucleated cells in the bone marrow of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This was done by observing the <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> of nucleated cells in bone marrow aspirates from 20 patients with AA by transmission electron microscopy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Erythroblasts were decreased in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases and not observed in 6 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nuclear abnormalities, such as pyknosis, karyolysis, karyorrhexis, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, and "Swiss cheese"-like changes, were found in 10 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Focal cytoplasmic necrotic changes and cytolysis were found in 3 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There were more megaloblasts in 4 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001911'>Abnormalities of granulocytes</z:hpo> were found in 12 out of 18 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Megakaryocytes showed focal cytoplasmic necrotic changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Most monocytes had dendritic features, including excessive cytoplasm, processes, and large round nuclei in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Other monocytes illustrated typical monocytic features with twisted nuclei, plentiful RER, vacuoles, lysosomes, and prominent Golgi apparatus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Macrophages and hemophagocytes occurred in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The incidence of lymphocytes was high in 17 out of 20 cases and occasionally lymphocytes were enlarged in 8 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>More plasmacytes and plasmacytoid lymphocytes were found in 5 and 3 cases, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The observations suggest that (1) the universal nuclear injury of erythroblasts may be related to the pathogenetic pathway of AA development; (2) the dendritic cells and hemophagocytes from the mononuclear phagocyte system may play a more critical role in hematopoietic failure of AA, directly and/or indirectly; and (3) besides T lymphocytes, increasing numbers of plasmacytes or plasmacytoid lymphocytes are associated with AA in some cases </plain></SENT>
