<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The signal intensity (SI) of BM was classified into four patterns according to the increasing amount of cellular marrow, i.e., pattern I to IV </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Of the eight patients on transplantation, the SI of the lumbar spinal BM was pattern III in two patients and IV in six on T1-weighted and short tau inversion recovery (STIR) images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the eight patients with immunosuppressive therapy, the SI of the lumbar spinal BM was pattern II in one, III in five, and IV in two on T1-weighted images and pattern II in one, III in four, and IV in three on STIR images </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SI on <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> imaging of the lumbar spinal BM showed a more cellular pattern in patients on transplantation than in those on immunosuppressive therapy </plain></SENT>
