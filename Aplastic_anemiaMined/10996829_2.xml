<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Previously, we reported that patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) have profoundly decreased numbers of hematopoietic progenitor and stem cells as measured in the long-term culture initiating cell (LTC-IC) assay (Blood 1996;88:1983-1991) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We now present results of a long-term prospective study of LTC-IC numbers in peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) of patients treated with antithymocyte globulin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Numbers of secondary colony forming cells (secondary CFC) in long-term bone marrow culture (LTBMC) were used to quantitate LTC-IC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>BM (N = 35) and PB (N = 41) secondary CFC from both untreated severe AA patients and responders to immunosuppressive therapy who were sampled up to 6 years after initial treatment were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> controls showed 148 +/- 38 (N = 17) and 16 +/- 3 (N= 14) secondary CFC per 10(6) in BM and PB, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In cross-sectional analysis, prior to therapy, AA patients showed 2.6 +/- 1 (mean +/- SD) secondary CFC/10(6) BM MNC; within the first year after initial treatment (N = 14), secondary CFC number rose modestly to 8.2 +/- 2.2/10(6) MNC, and further increased to 15.8 +/- 7 (N = 17) at 2 years and 16.2 +/- 7/10(6) MNC (N = 25) 3 years after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no further improvement in the secondary CFC numbers at 4, 5, and &gt; or =6 years (N = 37) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, while BM secondary CFC increased about 6-fold at 3 years post-therapy compared to presentation, they remained about only 10% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> despite hematologic recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Similar data were obtained for PB, with approximately 4-fold increase in secondary CFC numbers within 2 years of therapy, to about 15% of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We confirmed these observations in patients studied serially over a period of 4 years: initial secondary CFC were 2.35 +/- 1/10(6) BM MNC and 0.11 +/- 0.1/10(6) PB MNC improving to an average of 6 +/- 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>2 (BM; N = 12) and 2.4 +/- 1/10(6) MNC (PB; N = 14) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In many cases of partial recovery, PB counts improve but do not normalize </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>When we studied secondary CFC numbers only in patients who achieved complete normalization of PB counts (ANC &gt;1,500/mm(3); platelets &gt;10(5)/mm(3) and absolute reticulocytes &gt;5 x 10(4)/mm(3)), BM secondary CFC were significantly higher than in patients with partial recovery; the PB secondary CFC number was modestly increased but remained below the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Within the group of patients with complete recovery, there was no correlation between the secondary CFC and time after initial treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In addition, there also was no correlation between the secondary CFC number at presentation and the quality of hematopoietic recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Despite a limited expansion potential of a severely reduced stem cell pool, their numbers are sufficient to provide a long-term supply of mature blood cells </plain></SENT>
