<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Fifteen patients with transfusion-dependent severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (SAA) were treated with combined immunosuppression consisting of horse-antithymocyte globulin (ATG; Atgam, Upjohn) and high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50366">6-methylprednisolone</z:chebi> (MP) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Oxymetholone was scheduled for 2 years but was discontinued in 7 patients after 10-385 days due to liver toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serious side effects usually seen in ATG monotherapy were rare during combined immunosuppression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Currently 12 of 15 patients are alive 110-1,275 days (median 475.5) after start of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One patient has received too short treatment to be evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the others are transfusion-independent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Three patients died; two from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_681'>septicemia</z:mpath> before hemopoietic recovery could be expected and one after relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results confirm that the addition of high-dose MP abrogates the side effects of ATG monotherapy, and the addition of MP does not counteract, but rather enhances the beneficial effect of ATG in SAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We recommend combined immunosuppressive treatment with ATG and high-dose MP as a highly feasible, safe and effectful therapy for patients with transfusion-dependent SAA </plain></SENT>
