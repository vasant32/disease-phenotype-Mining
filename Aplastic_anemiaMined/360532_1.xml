<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, after grafting, HLA antibodies persisted in nine cases and graft rejection occurred, whereas in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> but one of the remaining eight cases the HLA antibodies disappeared and a permanent engraftment was observed (P = 0.0008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These results suggest a relationship between engraftment and persistence or disappearance of HLA antibodies as an indication of the level of immunosuppression obtained with the conditioning regimen </plain></SENT>
