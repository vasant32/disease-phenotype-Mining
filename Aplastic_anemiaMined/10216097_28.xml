<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To determine whether the antigen-driven T-cell response is involved in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA), we examined the complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) size distribution of T-cell receptor (TCR) beta-chain (BV) subfamilies in the bone marrow (BM) of untreated AA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>AA patients who did not respond to immunosuppressive therapy and those who obtained unmaintained remission early after <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> (CyA) or antithymocyte globulin (ATG) therapy exhibited essentially a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CDR3 size pattern </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In contrast, five patients who needed continuous administration of CyA to maintain remission exhibited a skewed CDR3 size pattern in a number (&gt;40%) of BV subfamilies suggestive of clonal predominance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The skewing of CDR3 size distribution became less pronounced in one of the CyA-dependent patients when the patient achieved unmaintained remission after a 4-year therapy with CyA, whereas it persisted longer than 7 years in the other patient requiring maintenance therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Sequencing of BV15 cDNA for which the CDR3 size pattern exhibited apparent clonal predominance in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> CyA-dependent patients showed high homology of the amino acid sequence of the CDR3 between two different patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that antigen-driven expansion of T cells is involved in the pathogenesis of AA characterized by CyA-dependent recovery of hematopoiesis </plain></SENT>
