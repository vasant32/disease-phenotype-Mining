<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The combination of horse anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> A (CsA) has shown satisfactory results for these patients, and so it has been regarded as the standard IST regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>However, treatment failure including unresponsiveness, relapse, and occurrence of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516669" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">clonal evolution</z:e> remains a major problem, although the results of IST have been improved in the past two decades </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Many studies have been conducted to overcome these problems; however, they have yet to show any satisfactory results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This review will discuss immune-mediated pathophysiology of AA, which is associated with therapeutic targets of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressive agents</z:chebi> and clinical outcomes of most commonly used IST regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Several trials to improve IST including the addition of other <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressive agents</z:chebi> or growth factors to standard IST regimen, comparison between horse ATG/CsA and rabbit ATG/CsA as first-line treatment, and promising alternative agents including alemtuzumab and eltrombopag will also be discussed, focusing on recently published literatures </plain></SENT>
