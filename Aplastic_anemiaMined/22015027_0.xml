<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Given the <z:hpo ids='HP_0003584'>late onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, relatively to other cytopenias, and the high variability in the phenotype, a correct clinical diagnosis is difficult, and may be delayed or even missed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This fact may be prejudicial to patients, due to the need of avoiding exposure to toxic agents, programming the transplantation of hematopoietic progenitor cells and screening of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002664'>neoplasia</z:hpo> associated with the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Given the high genetic variability (thirteen complementation groups have been identified, each with genes presenting several different mutations), a rapid molecular diagnosis is not possible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, there is an urgent need for a timely and correct diagnosis, due to the early evolution of the disease towards <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancy</z:e> and to the early need of finding compatible donors for future hematopoietic stem cell transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Fortunately, the hypersensitivity of FA cells to the clastogenic (chromosome breaking) effect of DNA cross-linking agents, in particular to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="23704">diepoxybutane</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="23704">DEB</z:chebi>), provides a unique marker for the diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At present, cytogenetic analysis for detection of <z:chebi fb="3" ids="23704">DEB</z:chebi>-induced chromosome instability is the gold-standard test for the diagnosis of FA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the present work we present the results from the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="23704">DEB</z:chebi> induced chromosome instability studies performed in the Laboratory of Cytogenetics of ICBAS between 1992 and 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Blood samples from 222 patients were obtained from different hospitals mainly from the north and centre of Portugal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>This population includes not only patients with clinical suspicion of FA, but also patients presented with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, pancitopenia or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, for confirmation/exclusion of FA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Two samples of amniotic fluid were also obtained for pre-natal diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>A total of 34 FA patients were diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Cytogenetic studies were also performed in blood samples from AF relatives, which allowed the diagnosis of 6 new cases, 5 of them corresponding to asymptomatic individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>In the total population of FA patients studied, 25% belong to the gypsy ethnic group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Periodic cytogenetic studies were also performed in blood samples from AF patients post transplantation, which confirmed the elimination of the original hematopoietic <z:chebi fb="3" ids="23704">DEB</z:chebi> sensitive cells </plain></SENT>
