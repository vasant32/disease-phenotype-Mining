<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the present work, granulocyte reserves and related mobilization functions have been sequentially assessed by the endotoxin stress assay during the preclinical and clinical phases of these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemopoietic disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Characteristic patterns of granulocyte reserve mobilization are described that reflect given stages of pathologic progression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>For radiation-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, a five stage pattern has been proposed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast, a simple pattern of progressive, time-dependent contraction of granulocyte reserves and mobilization capacity was noted in the development of terminal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Early preclinical phases of radiation-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> appear to involve an extensive <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of the granulocyte reserves ((phase I) during the first approximately 200 days of exposure followed by a partial renewal of the reserves and associated mobilization functions approximately 200 and 400 days (phase II) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Sustained, subnormal granulocyte mobilizations (phase III) following endotoxin stress typify the responses of dogs during the intermediate phase, whereas late preclinical, preleukemic stages (phase IV) are characterized by a further expansion of the reserves and in the mobilization capacities, particularly of the less mature granulocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Such late alterations in the pattern of granulocyte mobilization, together with other noted cellular aberrancies in the peripheral blood and marrow, appear to indicate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (phase V) <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
