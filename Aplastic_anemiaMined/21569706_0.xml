<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Forty-eight SAA patients (31 males, 17 females) including 17 very severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemias</z:hpo> (vSAA) were treated with ALG plus CsA between 1999 to 2009 in our hospital and the outcomes were analyzed retrospectively for early mortality, response rate and quality, survival rate, toxicity and complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The median age was 28 (13 - 64) years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The interval from diagnosis to treatment was 45 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median neutrophil count at diagnosis was 0.178 Ã— 10(9)/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Overall response was 83.3% (54.2% complete, 29.2% partial) with a median time of 90 (23 - 380) days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>10.4% died of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> within 30 days mainly of fungi <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Only 1 patient relapsed 2 years after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No clonal disease was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The 1.5-year survival rate was 87.5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>vSAAs had less response, higher early mortality and less survival (64.7%, 29.4% and 51.8%, respectively) compared to that of SAA (93.5%, 0, 100%, respectively, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Grouped patients with different age, gender, intervals between diagnosis and treatment and pre-existing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> had similar response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The main side effects were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000988'>skin rash</z:hpo> (52.1%), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036830" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">serum sickness</z:e> (16.7%), impaired liver function (60.4%) and <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>hemorrhage</z:mp> (2.1%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>No treatment-related mortality was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: P-ALG plus CsA is an ideal and well tolerated treatment for SAA but not for vSAA </plain></SENT>
