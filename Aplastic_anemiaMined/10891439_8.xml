<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We studied a large kindred with nonsyndromic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000006'>autosomal dominant</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> to define the phenotype and used genomic linkage analysis to determine the locus of the abnormal gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Affected family members are characterized by lifelong moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> (mean = 42.7 x 10(9)/L) with moderate propensity toward <z:hpo ids='HP_0000978'>easy bruising</z:hpo> and minor <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Megakaryocytes are present in bone marrow with reduced frequency, and there are no apparent abnormalities of myeloid or erythroid cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This type of inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> has no evident association with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376544" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematopoietic malignancy</z:e> or progression to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the past, members of this family have failed therapeutic trials of immunosuppression and splenectomy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In our investigation, we found that affected individuals had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> platelet size compared with unaffected family members and modestly increased thrombopoietin levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Hematopoietic colony assays from bone marrow and peripheral blood demonstrated that megakaryocyte precursors (CFU-Mk) were dramatically increased in both number and size in affected individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow cells grown in liquid culture with thrombopoietin failed to develop polyploid cells greater than 8N </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Also, electron microscopy demonstrated that megakaryocytes from an affected individual had markedly delayed nuclear and cytoplasmic differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Genome-wide linkage analysis established a single locus for the disease gene on the short arm of chromosome 10 with a maximum 2-point lod score of 5.68 (at theta = 0) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>By recruiting additional family members, the genomic region was narrowed to 17 centimorgans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We conclude that a gene in this locus plays an important role in megakaryocyte endomitosis and terminal maturation </plain></SENT>
