<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, in other hematologic autoimmune conditions its role is still controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Methods: Seven patients with either <z:hpo ids='HP_0001890'>autoimmune hemolytic anemia</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272126" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Evans' syndrome</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, pure red cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath>, thrombotic thrombocytopenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000979'>purpura</z:hpo>, or acquired factor VIII inhibitors were treated with a single course of high-dose (2 g/kg) IVIg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Results: A good response was observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> seven patients, except the one with thrombotic thrombocytopenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000979'>purpura</z:hpo>, and there were no adverse effects related to IVIg use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The literature reports on IVIg therapy in these conditions and the mechanisms of action of IVIg in <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> are discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Conclusions: IVIg might be a useful agent in the treatment of several <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521860" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic disorders</z:e> other than immune thrombocytopenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000979'>purpura</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Future aims of clinical research in this respect would be to identify the patient subgroups that might benefit more from IVIg in these conditions </plain></SENT>
