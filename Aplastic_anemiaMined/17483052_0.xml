<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine the efficacy of CsA in the treatment of AA, we treated 38 AA patients with CsA alone and followed up the patients for 6 months to 16 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients (53%) achieved either a partial or complete remission within 1 year of starting CsA therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirteen (81%) of 16 patients who showed an increase in the reticulocyte count of &gt;20 x 10(9)/L within 2 months achieved remission, whereas the response rate was only 32% in patients who failed to show such an increase in the reticulocyte count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The actuarial overall survival and failure-free survival rates at 5 years were 91% and 37%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that CsA alone can achieve a sustained remission in approximately 40% of AA patients, with a low probability of inducing secondary clonal diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Given its low toxicity and because the effectiveness of CsA can be judged within 2 months of therapy, CsA may be the first drug of choice at outpatient clinics for AA patients not requiring transfusions </plain></SENT>
