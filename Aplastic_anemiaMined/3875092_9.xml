<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mechanism by which it exerts its effects on hematopoiesis is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this report, we describe the ability of horse ATG to induce growth and differentiation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A single cell suspension of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> human bone marrow was cultured in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53448">methylcellulose</z:chebi> medium and examined for the growth and maturation after incubation with ATG (10 micrograms/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After 3-4 days of culture, spherical colonies containing mature myeloid elements were found in cultures containing ATG but not in cultures containing medium or preimmunization horse IgG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The addition of 10% colony-stimulating factor increased growth by 40% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The number of spherical colonies is not dependent on the presence of macrophages or T lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This property of ATG may be relevant to the mechanism behind the hematologic recovery in some patients with acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We also describe the ability of ATG to induce terminal differentiation in the HL60 leukemic cell line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>ATG binds to HL60 cells and at concentrations between 10 and 100 micrograms/ml, 50% of the cells become mature granulocytes, acquire the ability to reduce <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9505">nitroblue tetrazolium</z:chebi>, and lose their proliferative capacity in the clonogenic assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These new observations of ATG-induced differentiation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> marrow myeloid elements and terminal differentiation of the HL60 cell line point to different avenues for future search of differentiation-inducing agents </plain></SENT>
