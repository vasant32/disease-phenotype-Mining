<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The recovery of host-hematopoiesis, autologous recovery (AR), after allogeneic HSCT is a rare event and the incidence and long-term survival are unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report a retrospective analysis of consecutive patients in the Aplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>Anaemia</z:hpo> Working Party of the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT-WPSAA) registry between 1973 and 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A total of 45 cases of AR, of 1205 patients transplanted for SAA in 57 centers are reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We describe characteristics and long-term outcome of patients with AR, compared with SAA patients from participating transplant centers without AR (n=1024) and patients with graft rejection (n=136) without autologous recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The estimated cumulative incidence of AR was 4.2% (3.1-5.6) (confidence interval (CI) 95%) with an OS of 84% (95% CI 83-107%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The OS of the control group was 74% (81-90) at 10 years of follow up, whereas the patients with graft failure had an OS of 16% (CI 12-28%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This retrospective analysis establishes the incidence and long-term survival of patients experiencing AR after allogeneic HSCT for SAA </plain></SENT>
