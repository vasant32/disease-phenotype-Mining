<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Fanconi <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (FA) is a <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic disorder</z:e> that leads to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and birth defects and predisposes to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>FA cells exhibit characteristic hypersensitivity to DNA cross-linking agents such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="27504">mitomycin C</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="172" ids="27504">MMC</z:chebi>), and FANCG is one of six known FA gene products </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By immunocytochemical analysis of transfected cells, we discovered that although FANCG localized to both the nucleus and cytoplasm, there was an increase in cells with predominantly cytoplasmic staining after treatment with <z:chebi fb="172" ids="27504">MMC</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Concurrently, while searching by two-hybrid analysis for proteins that associate with FANCG, we identified a novel interaction between FANCG and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38559">cytochrome P450</z:chebi> 2E1 (CYP2E1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A member of the P450 superfamily, CYP2E1 is associated with the production of reactive oxygen intermediates and the bioactivation of carcinogens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>High constitutive levels of CYP2E1 were found in a FA-G lymphoblast cell line, whereas complementation of the FA-G line with <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> FANCG was associated with decreased CYP2E1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings suggested that the interaction of FANCG with CYP2E1 might alter redox metabolism and increase DNA oxidation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Using a fluorescent assay, we found a dose-dependent increase in the oxidized DNA base, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44605">8-oxoguanine</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="52617">8-oxoG</z:chebi>), after treatment of mutant FA-G cells with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16240">H(2)O(2)</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="172" ids="27504">MMC</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Conversely, significantly lower levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52617">8-oxoG</z:chebi> were detected in FANCG-complemented FA-G cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the unknown function of FANCG involves at least transient interaction with cytoplasmic components, possibly including CYP2E1, and propose a role for FANCG in protection against oxidative DNA damage </plain></SENT>
