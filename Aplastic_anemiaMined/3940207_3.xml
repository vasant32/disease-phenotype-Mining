<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>An apparent cluster of four <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) cases in teenagers residing in a small South Carolina town was further investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Incidence of AA in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> age groups in a surrounding three county area (<z:chebi fb="6" ids="30956">TCA</z:chebi>) over a 12-year time interval was determined and compared with AA incidence rates in Baltimore, representing the only known population based United States incidence data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The same general age-specific incidence pattern (based on 27 cases in the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="30956">TCA</z:chebi> and 118 in Baltimore) was found in the two areas, both overall and for the four race-sex groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although based on small numbers, nonwhite average annual age-adjusted rates for males and females were higher in the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="30956">TCA</z:chebi> (6.8 and 13.7 per million) than in Baltimore (4.7 and 7.3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>For whites, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="30956">TCA</z:chebi> rates were 11.7 and 5.4 (for males and females) and Baltimore rates were 7.1 and 5.4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The differences for non-whites in the two areas may indicate a greater prevalence of risk factors for AA in the <z:chebi fb="6" ids="30956">TCA</z:chebi> than in Baltimore, but the small numbers of cases and the lack of comparable data from other areas of the country, together with the possibility of misdiagnosis of the disease, make definitive conclusions impossible </plain></SENT>
