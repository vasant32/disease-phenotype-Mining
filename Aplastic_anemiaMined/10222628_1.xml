<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report our experiences with HLA-matched unrelated bonemarrow transplantation combining a preconditioning regimen of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, antithymocyte globulin (ATG), and total body irradiation for two patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (SAA) who had already undergone repeated blood transfusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Short-term <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> were administered for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) prophylaxis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Both patients achieved rapid engraftment within 3 weeks, furthermore, neither <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> nor <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Our conditioning regimen appeared to be well-suited for unrelated bone marrow transplantation in heavily transfused SAA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, both patients experienced bouts of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> about 20-30 and 40-50 days after transplantation, and it was difficult to differentiate whether they were affected by <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD, cytomegalovirus (CMV) <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e>, or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036830" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">serum sickness</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Because weakly positive CMV antigenemia was detected, both patients were given <z:chebi fb="0" ids="465284">ganciclovir</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although their <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> did not respond initially, it gradually subsided following the combined administration of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These outcomes suggest it is essential that attention be devoted to the potential for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0036830" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">serum sickness</z:e> and the high risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019372" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">herpes virus infections</z:e>, particularly by CMV, following the use of intensive preconditioning regimens that include ATG </plain></SENT>
