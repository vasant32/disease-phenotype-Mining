<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Also second-line and salvage options are briefly illustrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>First-line IST should consist of horse anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) and CsA that has been shown to result in response rates between 60 and 80% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>CsA should be given for 12 months until transfusion independence is achieved and then tapered very slowly in the presence of a CR </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Patients with a partial response are usually continued on CsA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Tight monitoring of the blood count during CsA tapering is necessary to identify early loss of response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>G-CSF 5 μg/kg/day s.c. in the first 30 days has been shown to reduce <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> and hospitalization and to identify early responders, as those who achieve neutrophils count of0.5 × 10(9)/L by day +30 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This schedule is recommended in the first month of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Afterward, G-CSF can be considered in neutropenic febrile episodes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients not achieving transfusion independence after a first course of IST may be considered for second-line IST, or for an allogeneic hematopoietic SCT depending on patient age, ongoing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, neutrophil count and transfusion requirements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Third-line IST is rarely given, but some options are discussed </plain></SENT>
