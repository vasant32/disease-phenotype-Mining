<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the records of 16 children diagnosed from 1990 to 2003 and treated by IST, among whom 14 received the standardized regimen of antithymocyte globulin (ATG) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> A (CsA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serial hematologic parameters, complications, transfusion requirements, and time to response were assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: One child who died from a pre-existing <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0851807" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Aspergillus infection</z:e> prior to expected IST response was excluded from the analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Overall (transfusion-independent) response to IST was 100% (13/13), without any relapses or clinically evident leukemic/myelodysplastic transformations after a median follow-up time of 4.4 years (range: 10 months-13.3 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This report documents excellent outcome using combination ATG and CsA IST for pediatric SAA </plain></SENT>
