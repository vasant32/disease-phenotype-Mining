<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We report the results of a randomized multicenter study comparing the efficacy of antithymocyte globulin (ATG) with that of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> (CsA) as first-line therapy for severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (SAA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients were randomized to receive ATG and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> (PDN) or CsA; hematologic response and toxicity were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At 3-month evaluation, patients who had no or minimal response received the alternative therapy to assess the value of a sequential immunosuppressive therapy for treatment of severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One hundred nineteen patients were randomized; 25 were excluded, of whom 3 were misdiagnosed and 22 did not follow the cross-over protocol </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Ninety-four patients were analyzed; 46 received CsA, and 48 received ATG-PDN </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The actuarial survival was 66.7%, with a median follow-up time of 19 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in survival between the groups with, at 3 months, an actuarial survival of 88% in the CsA group and 75% in the ATG group (NS); at 12 months, it was 70% in the CsA group and 64% in the ATG group (NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The percentage of complete and partial response was 11.6% and 16%, respectively, at 3 months, and 31.6% and 30%, respectively, at 12 months (NS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The main prognostic factor was the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) at entry: Patients with ANC less than 0.2 x 10(9)/L had a significantly lower survival as compared with patients with more than 0.2 x 10(9)/L ANC (P = .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At 12 months, 62 evaluable patients were alive, with a complete or partial response in 36 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Patients who had responded to the first treatment had a better recovery of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> than those who had sequential immunosuppression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The main complication was <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, which was more often observed and more often lethal during ATG and PDN therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In this study, initial treatment of SAA with either CsA or ATG-PDN followed by cross-over therapy for nonresponders produced comparable response and survival rates </plain></SENT>
