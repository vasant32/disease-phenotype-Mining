<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In comparison, little information is available on early erythroid differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We describe here the isolation and characterization of a highly inducible clone from a murine erythroid cell line, which is capable of forming colonies that possess properties of the early erythroid burst progenitor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We found that a combination of erythropoietin (Epo), spleen conditioned medium (SCM), and plasma from a patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (Apa) induces over 95% of cells from this clone (clone 12) to form colonies with the properties of burst or mixed burst blast-like colonies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Examination of the culture conditions of these cells indicated that alpha medium was more efficient for colony induction than Iscove's medium, and that the addition of two-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="41218">mercaptoethanol</z:chebi> did not improve the induction process </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These factors (EPo, SCM, and Apa) must be present for 4 days in order for induction to take place </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>It is hoped that the isolation of this highly inducible cell clone will enrich our understanding of early erythroid differentiation </plain></SENT>
