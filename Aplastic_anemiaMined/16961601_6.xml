<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We proposed diagnostic criteria for immune thrombocytopenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000979'>purpura</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi>) by modifying the existing guidelines for diagnosis of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> and by incorporating laboratory tests found useful for predicting its diagnosis, for example erythrocyte count, leukocyte count, anti-GPIIb/IIIa antibody-producing B cells, platelet-associated anti-GPIIb/IIIa antibodies, percentage of reticulated platelets, and plasma thrombopoietin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE AND METHODS: To validate our criteria, we conducted a multi-center prospective study involving 112 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> and a morphologically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> peripheral blood film at the first visit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Each patient underwent a physical examination, routine laboratory tests, and specialized tests for the anti-GPIIb/IIIa antibody response and platelet turnover </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Ninety-one patients (81%) satisfied the proposed criteria at first visit </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical diagnosis was made by skilled hematologists &gt; 6 months after the first visit; <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> was diagnosed in 88 patients and non-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> disorders in 24 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The proposed criteria had 98% sensitivity, 79% specificity, a 95% positive predictive value, and a 90% negative predictive value </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A relatively low specificity appears to be attributed to a few patients who had both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our preliminary diagnostic criteria based on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi>-associated laboratory findings were useful for the differential diagnosis of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi>, but additional evaluations and modifications will be necessary to develop criteria that can be used routinely </plain></SENT>
