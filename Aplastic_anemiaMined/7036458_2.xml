<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Cellular immune functions were evaluated longitudinally in seven children with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, who were successfully transplanted with bone marrow cells from an HLA-identical, mixed lymphocyte culture (MLC)-negative sibling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Several parameters were followed: the number of lymphocytes and E rosette-forming cells in the peripheral blood and the lymphocyte reactivity toward various <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogens</z:chebi>, antigens, and allogeneic lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Some patients already displayed decreased in vitro lymphocyte reactivity before transplantation, especially with regard to the response to pokeweed <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogen</z:chebi> (PWM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After transplantation, a severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0005374'>cellular immunodeficiency</z:hpo> developed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, with low numbers of T cells and markedly impaired responsiveness to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogens</z:chebi>, antigens, and allogeneic lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Variations between patients were substantial, both with regard to the severity and duration of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> and to the pattern of the recovery of lymphocyte responses to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogens</z:chebi> and antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This variability might be attributable to an imbalanced proliferation of different lymphocyte subsets and/or the sequence of appearance of receptors for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogens</z:chebi> on the cell surface </plain></SENT>
