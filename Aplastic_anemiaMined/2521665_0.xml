<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The binding of <z:chebi fb="60" ids="24859">iodine</z:chebi> 125-labeled fibronectin to polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) from human peripheral blood was examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The optimum temperature and time for the binding were 37 degrees C and 30 minutes, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On increase in the amount of 125I-labeled fibronectin, its binding to PMNs became saturated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Scatchard analysis of data on binding indicated the presence of a single class of binding sites </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>PMNs from 15 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects had approximately 6.3 +/- 1.6 x 10(3) sites per cell and a dissociation constant of 10.2 +/- 2.4 x 10(-9) mol/L, indicating that they had high affinity for soluble fibronectin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser inhibited the binding of fibronectin to PMNs, strongly suggesting that the fibronectin receptor is one of the Arg-Gly-Asp receptor family </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The plasma level of fibronectin was higher in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000836'>hyperthyroidism</z:hpo> and lower in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000821'>hypothyroidism</z:hpo> than in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects, without any significant change in the number of fibronectin binding sites of the PMNs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the number of binding sites of fibronectin on PMNs of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> was increased, probably because of sensitization of the PMNs with immune complex and other factors </plain></SENT>
