<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>She became refractory to human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched platelet transfusions and experienced frequent episodes of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>She was treated with intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi> administered weekly for three doses and showed marked improvement in both clinical and laboratory response to platelet transfusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi> was held for 3 weeks, she again became refractory to HLA-matched platelet transfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Reinstitution of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28445">vincristine</z:chebi> resulted in cessation of clinical <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> and improved response to platelet transfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The mechanism of response likely involves selective delivery of cytotoxic drug to macrophages </plain></SENT>
