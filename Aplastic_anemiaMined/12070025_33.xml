<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We have hypothesized that in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) the presence of antigen-specific T cells is reflected by their contribution to the expansion of a particular variable beta chain (V beta) subfamily and also by clonal CDR3 skewing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine the role of disease-specific "signature" T-cell clones in AA, we studied preferential V beta usage by flow cytometry and analyzed V beta-CDR3 regions for the presence of oligoclonality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We first established the contribution of each V beta family to the total CD4(+) and CD8(+) lymphocyte pool; in AA and <z:hpo ids='HP_0004818'>paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</z:hpo>, a seemingly random overrepresentation of different V beta families was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>On average, we found expansion in 3 (of 22 examined) V beta families per patient </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>When the contribution of individual V beta families to the effector pool was examined, more striking V beta skewing was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>V beta-CDR3 size distribution was analyzed for the expanded V beta families in isolated CD4(+) and CD8(+) populations; underrepresented V beta families displayed more pronounced CDR3 skewing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Expanded CD4(+)V beta subfamilies showed mostly a polyclonal CDR3 size distribution with only 38% of skewing in expanded V beta families </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In contrast, within overrepresented CD8(+)V beta types, marked CDR3 skewing (82%) was seen, consistent with nonrandom expansion of specific CD8(+) T-cell clones </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>No preferential expansion of particular V beta families was observed, in relation to HLA-type </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In patients examined after immunosuppressive therapy, an abnormal V beta-distribution pattern was retained, but the degree of expansion of individual V beta was lower </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>As V beta skewing may correlate with relative V beta size, oligoclonality in combination with numerical V beta expansion can be applied to recognition of disease-specific T-cell receptors </plain></SENT>
