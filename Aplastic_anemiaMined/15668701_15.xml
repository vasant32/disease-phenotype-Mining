<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In vivo expansion of dominant T-cell clones can reflect an antigen-driven immune response but may also represent autonomous proliferation, such as in large granular lymphocytic (LGL)-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>T-cell clonality can be assessed by a combination of T-cell receptor (TCR) flow cytometry and complementarity-determining-region-3 (CDR3) molecular analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We studied 24 PNH patients for evidence of in vivo dominant T-cell responses by flow cytometry; TCR-Vbeta-specific expansions were identified in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In four cases, extreme expansions of one Vbeta-subset of CD8+/CD28-/CD56+ (effector) phenotype mimicked subclinical LGL-disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The monoclonality of these expansions was inferred from unique CDR3-size peak distributions and sequencing of dominant clonotypes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the molecular analysis of TCR-beta chain may demonstrate clonal LGL-like expansions at unexpected frequency in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
