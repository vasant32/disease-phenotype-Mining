<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Because <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> often develops in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA), we attempted to detect a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> clone in the bone marrow (BM) of patients with AA and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> before affected cells were evident in the peripheral blood (PB) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We used flow cytometry with monoclonal antibodies against DAF and CD59 for the detection of the clone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Affected cells were observed in the BM of 3 of 7 patients with AA and 1 of 3 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> of unknown origin, but not in their PB </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On the basis of the early appearance of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> clone in the BM, a prospective 4-month follow-up study of the PB cells was performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The study showed the release of affected mature cells first in granulocytes, then in monocytes, and finally in lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ham's test was positive before affected erythrocytes were detected by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our findings indicate that detection of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> clone in BM could be predictive of the development of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> in patients with AA and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
