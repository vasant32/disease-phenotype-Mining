<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Prompted by previous reports that in certain patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, cell-mediated autoimmune suppression of myeloid stem cell proliferation may be demonstrable in vitro, we studied the effects of bone marrow lymphocytes from 18 patients with myeloid <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> on the proliferation of committed granulocytic-monocytic progenitor cells (CFU-C) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>When assayed in soft agar cultures, marrow suspensions from 10 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> contained significantly fewer viable CFU-C than similar cell preparations from control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To deplete marrow cell suspensions of lymphocytes, we employed rabbit anti-human thymocyte serum (ATS), which after multiple adsorptions exhibited marked cytotoxicity for human B and T lymphocytes but had negligible effect on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CFU-C proliferation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Preincubation of marrow samples from 12 patients with ATS and complement resulted in no inhibition or enhancement of CFU-C growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In further experiments, marrow cells from 8 patients were incubated with marrow from control subjects prior to CFU-C culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No suppression of donor CFU-C proliferation was observed in any of these studies, and in 4 cocultures, mixture of the 2 marrow suspensions resulted in stimulation of CFU-C growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using these assays, we detected no evidence of cell-mediated inhibition of CFU-C proliferation in any of the 18 patients that we evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our data support the conclusion that in the majority of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, an absolute deficiency of hemopoietic stem cells is present within the marrow that does not appear to be effected or sustained by suppressor lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Whether the reduction of viable stem cells is the cause or the consequence of the process that leads to marrow failure remains unknown </plain></SENT>
