<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Although horse antithymocyte globuline (ATG) is the preferred option, our patients received rabbit ATG; since horse ATG is not available in Turkey </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We reviewed the medical records of children with SAA who were treated with rabbit ATG, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi>, and granulocyte colony stimulating factor (GCSF) between 2006 and 2012 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Fifteen children with SAA aged between 1.5 and 17Â years received rabbit ATG as first line treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only two of them showed partial response and the others did not give any response at 3rd, 6th, and 12th months after the first course of IST </plain></SENT>
