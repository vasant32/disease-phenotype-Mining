<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The myelokaryocyte proliferation was inhibited at the G0-1 stages of cell cycle, the number of cells in the S phase was decreased, and the coefficient of variations cV of DNA cytofluorometry values were increased in AA patients in comparison with the norm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By contrast, in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients the number of cells in the G0-1 phase was decreased and that of cells in the S phase increased in comparison with the norm and with AA patients; cV was increased </plain></SENT>
