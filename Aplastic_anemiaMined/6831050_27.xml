<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both compounds undergo metabolism to potentially toxic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="33658">arene</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> intermediates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We tested the hypothesis that the patient's adverse reactions were due to a defect in detoxification of such metabolites by challenging his peripheral lymphocytes with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49103">drug metabolites</z:chebi> generated by a murine hepatic microsomal system in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patient's cell viability was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in the absence of drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, his cells showed greater toxicity from both phenytoin and carbamazepine metabolites than did controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Toxicity was dependent on microsomes and <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Intermediate toxicity was noted in cells from the patient's mother </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The results provide the first evidence for a role of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="33658">arene</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49103">drug metabolites</z:chebi> in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> in humans and suggest that enhanced susceptibility to toxicity may be based on an inherited abnormality in metabolite detoxification </plain></SENT>
