<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two sets of cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) obtained from two multitransfused female <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> patients were used as typing reagents </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These cells were previously shown to kill allogeneic target cells from HLA-A2- or B7-positive male donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An antiserum obtained from one of the patients likewise killed HLA-A2 male lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The six patients studied were selected for the required antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Positive reactions were obtained with lymphocytes from a 46,XY woman with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000133'>pure gonadal dysgenesis</z:hpo> and a 45,XO male </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Target cells of the mother of the latter patient were also lysed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One individual with a 45,XO/46,X,del(Y)? karyotype was weakly positive, while three 46,<z:e sem="disease" ids="C0432475" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">XX males</z:e> were completely negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The reactivity of the HLA-A2-restricted H-Y-specific antibody showed the same discriminatory patterns </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The results obtained by the HLA-restricted CTLs as well as by the antiserum did not correlate with the presence of testes as is the case in a different test system for the serologically detectable male (SDM) antigen in man </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>On the other hand, there was a correlation with the presence of cytologically detectable Y-chromosome material in five of the six individuals studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The HLA-restricted CTLs and the antibody might recognize the classical transplantation antigen H-Y </plain></SENT>
