<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>When a trilineage response of hematopoiesis was obtained after the first treatment, a chromosomal change [45XX, -7] was observed in 20 of the 20 metaphases examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Later, we were able to show a monoclonal X inactivation pattern in the phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) gene in the peripheral blood polymorphonuclear leukocytes and mononuclear cells, indicating the presence of clonal hematopoiesis regardless of the disappearance of the karyotype abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We suggest that it is important to pay close attention to the appearance of clonal hematopoiesis during the administration of G-CSF to patients with idiopathic severe bone marrow <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
