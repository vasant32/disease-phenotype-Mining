<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">Deferoxamine</z:chebi>, an iron chelating agent, has been used for the treatment of <z:mp ids='MP_0005638'>hemochromatosis</z:mp> for more than 30 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ocular toxicity has begun to be reported only in the last few years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In most cases differentiation of the true etiology, i.e. the underlying disease versus the toxicity of the substance, is not clear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We report a patient with development of severe ocular toxicity during treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">deferoxamine</z:chebi> for transfusional <z:mp ids='MP_0005638'>hemochromatosis</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>HISTORY AND SIGNS: An 8-year-old boy was routinely evaluated in the eye clinic before initiation of treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">deferoxamine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Over the last three years the boy had developed a transfusional <z:mp ids='MP_0005638'>hemochromatosis</z:mp> after multiple blood transfusions for his <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Ophthalmologic examination displayed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> anterior segments with the exception of a unilateral small opacification of the posterior lens cortex, bilateral tortuous vessels, and mottling of the <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> pigment epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After four months the patient developed a decrease in visual acuity, distortion of color vision, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001123'>visual field defects</z:hpo>, alteration of electrophysiological parameters, and severe changes of the <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> pigment epithelium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>THERAPY AND OUTCOME: The <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">deferoxamine</z:chebi> was discontinued </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Over a period of 3 months the patient displayed a normalization of visual acuity and visual fields </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The changes of the <z:chebi fb="46" ids="15035">retinal</z:chebi> pigment epithelium and electrophysiological parameters showed further deterioration and did not return to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The patient subsequently was restarted on an adequate treatment dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">deferoxamine</z:chebi> and maintained an essentially uneventful course with close ophthalmologic followup </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4356">Deferoxamine</z:chebi> can cause severe ocular toxicity with incomplete recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Measurement of dark adaptation was especially valuable for follow-up examination </plain></SENT>
