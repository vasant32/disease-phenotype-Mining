<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: We report the case of factitiously induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> by the ingestion of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi>, a bifunctional alkylating chemotherapeutic agent used in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The medical consequences and financial costs of this illness are reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The reader will gain an understanding of the relevant clues to the diagnosis of a factitious hematologic illness, the psychodynamic issues present in this case and the legal, ethical and countertransferential issues raised by the case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHOD: A single case review including medical and billing records, patient and staff interviews and literature review </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The covert ingestion of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi> by this patient resulted in life-threatening bone marrow suppression, bilateral aseptic hip <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp>, transfusion-dependent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> and a <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> pain syndrome </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Her treatment was complicated by noncompliance with prescribed treatments and polymicrobial <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> possibly secondary to the self-injection of feces into her central line </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To date, the total cost of care for the treatment of this patient's medical complications secondary to her ingestion of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi> exceeds $1,100,000.00 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: This case underscores the importance of the early recognition by the primary care physician of the possibility of a factitious etiology of hematologic abnormalities such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> due to the ingestion of bone marrow ablative medications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The index of suspicion is increased when the patient is a young health care provider, usually female, with atypical <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> and an unusual disease course and response to treatment </plain></SENT>
