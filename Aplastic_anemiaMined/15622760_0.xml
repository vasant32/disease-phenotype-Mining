<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: In vitro effects of sera from SAA patients before and after IST and from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects on human marrow colony growth were examined in a semisolid <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53448">methylcellulose</z:chebi> culture system for burst promoting activity (BPA) and granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating activity (GM-CSA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serum erythropoietin (Epo) level was also measured by ELISA method before and after IST in SAA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Serum BPAs in SAA patients at diagnosis were significantly higher than that in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (P&lt;0.001), but serum GM-CSAs in 13 of 22 SAA patients were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>,and in 9 of 22 extremely low as compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After IST, serum BPA and GM-CSA in SAA patients had no changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Serum Epo levels in SAA patients at diagnosis were significantly higher than that in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After IST,serum Epo levels declined in responded patients, while further increased in nonresponded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Serum GM-CSA of SAA patients was a predictive factor for responsiveness to IST, and a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> value was associated with a good response </plain></SENT>
