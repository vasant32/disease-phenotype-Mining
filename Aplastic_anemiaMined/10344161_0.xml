<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The peripheral blood cells of ten patients with biopsy-proven <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> were studied by means of flow-cytometry in order to assess the expression of two phosphatidylinositol-anchored surface proteins: CD55/DAF (decay accelerating factor) and CD59/MIRL (membrane inhibitor of reactive lysis) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>An abnormal expression was found in five of these ten patients, whereas the "traditional" tests for <z:hpo ids='HP_0004818'>paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>) were positive only on two of these five individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Five of the aplastic patients were treated with anti-thymocyte globulin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin-A</z:chebi> and three entered a complete remission; of the latter, one had CD55/CD59 deficiencies whereas two did not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Along the study period one patient with a hemolytic pattern of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> was identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that CD55 and/or CD59 abnormalities are frequent in Mexican mestizo patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, that the aplastic presentation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> is more frequent in Mexico than the hemolytic presentation, that the flow-cytometric identification of CPI-anchored proteins is more sensitive than the "traditional" <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> tests, and that some patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>-<z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> may respond to intensive immunosuppressive treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The flow-cytometric identification of GPI-anchored cell surface proteins should replace the "traditional" tests in the identification of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
