<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We analyzed patients with AA (N = 93) and hypocellular <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (hMDS, N = 24) using single nucleotide polymorphism arrays (SNP-A) complementing routine cytogenetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We hypothesized that clinically important cryptic clonal aberrations may exist in some patients with BM failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Combined metaphase and SNP-A karyotyping improved detection of chromosomal lesions: 19% and 54% of AA and hMDS cases harbored clonal abnormalities including copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity (UPD, 7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Remarkably, lesions involving the HLA locus suggestive of clonal immune escape were found in 3 of 93 patients with AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In hMDS, additional clonal lesions were detected in 5 (36%) of 14 patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>/noninformative routine cytogenetics </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a subset of AA patients studied at presentation, persistent chromosomal genomic lesions were found in 10 of 33, suggesting that the initial diagnosis may have been hMDS </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Similarly, using SNP-A, earlier <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516669" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">clonal evolution</z:e> was found in 4 of 7 AA patients followed serially </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In sum, our results indicate that SNP-A identify cryptic clonal genomic aberrations in AA and hMDS leading to improved distinction of these disease entities </plain></SENT>
