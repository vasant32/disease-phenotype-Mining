<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Between February 1988 and January 1990, 35 patients underwent allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) from unrelated donors using measures routinely employed for matched related donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Median patient age was 34 years (range 2-49) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thirty-two patients had <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e>, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>) in 16; three patients had severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Donor-patient pairs were matched at the HLA loci tested serologically (HLA-A, -B, -DR) in 29 cases; mixed leukocyte culture results were variable but often reactive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five patients died prior to day +28 without evidence of myeloid engraftment, and one patient developed fatal graft failure several months after initial engraftment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) occurred in 77% (95% confidence interval [CI] 60-90%) of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients, and GVHD contributed to the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of 10 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Fatal regimen-related toxicity occurred in four patients and another died due to neurologic complications of a process that resembled the <z:hpo ids='HP_0005575'>hemolytic-uremic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> patients relapsed, and a <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> patient was found to have a localized non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> at necropsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>As of 1 June 1991, 14 patients are alive and in remission at a median follow-up of 1.9 years (range 1.5-3.3); <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> except one have <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> performance scores </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The 2-year actuarial event-free survival for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients is 40% (95% CI 24-56%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Proportional hazards analysis revealed favorable significance for female patient sex, less advanced disease status and shorter interval from diagnosis to BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>While unrelated-donor transplants need not necessarily duplicate the results of related-donor transplants to be of benefit, the event-free survival in this series was roughly similar to that expected in the related-donor situation, with the high transplant-related mortality somewhat offset by a low recurrence rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Further studies using unrelated donors, employing new methods of preventing transplant-related complications, are indicated </plain></SENT>
