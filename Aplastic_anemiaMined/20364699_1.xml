<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>AIM: to estimate the regulation of erythropoiesis and the coagulation system in patients with suppressed hematopoiesis in a mountain hospital (3200 m above sea level) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>SUBJECTS AND METHODS:The investigation included 12 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) and 10 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001973'>idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Blood was received at a Bishkek hospital, then on days 20 and 40 of stay in the mountains </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The authors studied erythropoietin (EPO) by enzyme immunoassay (Protein Contour kit, Russia), serum ferritin (SF) by immunoradioassay (Immunotech kit, Czech Republic), <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp>-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17230">homocysteine</z:chebi> (HC), hepcidin, endothelin (ET), and thrombomodulin (TM) by sandwich enzyme immunoassay, by applying monospecific antisera and monoclonal antibodies against relevant antigens (IDG Int Inc, USA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: On staying in the mountains, there was a gradual increase in the content of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> in patients with AA and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>On day 40, in keeping with higher <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (Hb) levels, both groups showed a decrease in HIF-1alpha concentrations to the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values (from 8.2 to 4.5 pg/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Due to the anemic syndrome, baseline EPO was increased by 5-7 times in the patients from both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On days 20-40, the content of EPO showed a 1.3-2.5-fold increase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In AA, HC was almost 3 times greater than the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> values; in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi>, it was 1.5-fold increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>On day 20 and during the patients'stay in the mountains, the level of HC remained in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> range in both groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Hypoxic <z:mp ids='MP_0005039'>hypoxia</z:mp> positively affects a number of hematological parameters, by normalizing erythropoiesis (Hb, EPO, and HIF-1alpha), iron metabolism (SF), and the coagulation system (HC, ET, and TM) </plain></SENT>
