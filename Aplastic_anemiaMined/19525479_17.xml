<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, there are unusually high bone marrow transplant (BMT) rejection rates in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Rejection correlates with the number of transfusions before bone marrow transplantation, and it has been hypothesized that preimmunization to antigens on transfused blood may prime BMT rejection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Using a novel mouse model of red blood cell (RBC) transfusion and major histocompatibility complex-matched bone marrow transplantation, we report that transfusion of RBC products induced BMT rejection across minor histocompatibility antigen (mHA) barriers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It has been proposed that contaminating leukocytes are responsible for transfusion-induced BMT rejection; however, filter leukoreduction did not prevent rejection in the current studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, we generated a novel transgenic mouse with RBC-specific expression of a model mHA and demonstrated that transfusion of RBCs induced a CD8(+) T-cell response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Together, these data suggest that mHAs on RBCs themselves are capable of inducing BMT rejection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Cellular immunization to mHAs is neither monitored nor managed by current transfusion medicine practice; however, the current data suggest that mHAs on RBCs may represent an unappreciated and significant consequence of RBC transfusion </plain></SENT>
