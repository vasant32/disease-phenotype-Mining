<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One such intermediate, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35801">nitroso</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17698">chloramphenicol</z:chebi> (NO-CAP), has been found to be a potent agent for mediating degradation of isolated DNA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a reaction mixture containing 100 microM NO-CAP, 100 microM CuCl2, and 5 mM <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16908">NADH</z:chebi>, 7 micrograms of Escherichia coli [3H]DNA was completely degraded to acid-soluble fragments in 30 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Damage to DNA was in the form of single-stranded scissions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The requirement for copper was specific, and copper chelating reagents blocked the degradation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The need for a reducing agent could be met equally well by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16908">NADH</z:chebi> or <z:chebi fb="1" ids="16474">NADPH</z:chebi>, but not by sulfhydryl reagents such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16856">glutathione</z:chebi>, dithiothreitol and 2-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="41218">mercaptoethanol</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Oxygen was also necessary for the NO-CAP mediated DNA damage, with reduced forms of oxygen participating in the reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>A role for <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30492">H2O2</z:chebi> was indicated by the inhibition of the degradation seen when catalase was included in the mixture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="29191">Hydroxyl radicals</z:chebi> are known to be produced in the reaction of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="30492">H2O2</z:chebi> with certain <z:chebi fb="4" ids="27081">transition metals</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Scavangers of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="29191">hydroxyl radicals</z:chebi> also inhibited strand-scission, suggesting that the radicals may be the primary agents in DNA degradation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The importance of the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35801">nitroso</z:chebi> moiety of NO-CAP was evidenced by the lack of DNA damage seen when NO-CAP was replaced by CAP under the conditions tested </plain></SENT>
