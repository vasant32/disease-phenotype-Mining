<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinical outcomes of 19 transplanted Japanese patients were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Prior to HSCT, 10 patients (53%) suffered <z:mp ids='MP_0005639'>hemosiderosis</z:mp> with organ dysfunction, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> eight with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004322'>short stature</z:hpo> (42%) had adverse effects of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Median age at the time of HSCT was 56 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transplantation sources were 13 bone marrow [six human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched siblings, and six HLA-matched and one HLA-mismatched unrelated donors], five cord blood (two HLA-matched siblings and three HLA-mismatched unrelated donors), and one peripheral blood from haploidentical mother </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 13 patients with bone marrow transplantation (BMT) and two with sibling cord blood transplantation (CBT) had successful engraftment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Of three patients who underwent unrelated CBT, one died after engraftment, and the other two had graft failure but succeeded in a second BMT from an HLA-disparate father and unrelated donor, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One died shortly after haploidentical PBSCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The five-yr failure-free survival rate after BMT was higher than CBT (100%: 40%, p=0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Platelet recovery was slower in seven unrelated BMT than in six sibling BMT (p=0.030) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>No other factors were associated with engraftment and survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that allogeneic BMT, but not unrelated CBT, is an effective HSCT for refractory <z:chebi fb="28" ids="35299">DBA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
