<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This block was overcome in vitro by elimination of marrow lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, this differentiation block was transferred in vitro to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> marrow by coculturing with the patient's marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We suggest that some cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> may be due to an immunologically based suppression of marrow cell differentiation rather than to a defect in stem cells or their necessary inductive environment </plain></SENT>
