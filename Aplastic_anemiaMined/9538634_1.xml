<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There may, however, be an increased risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host-disease</z:e> (GVHD) because of the large number of lymphocytes present in a leukapheresis product </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>An 18-year-old man with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> underwent an allogeneic BMT using his HLA-identical sister </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After initial excellent graft take for 8 months, his blood counts gradually decreased to 2.8 x 10(9)/L of white cells and 28 x 10(9)/L of platelets with marrow cellularity of &lt; 10% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After allogeneic granulocyte-colony stimulating factor mobilized PBSC rescue, the patient's blood counts recovered satisfactorily </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Around 1 year after the boost, he developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD that responded to <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>He is now well on low-dose steroids at day +1055 after PBSC rescue </plain></SENT>
