<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, higher number of prior transfusions, shorter period of immunosuppression with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> and GVHD were associated with inferior survival; moreover, a higher risk of graft rejection were associated with a higher number of prior transfusions and a trend was observed for a shorter <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> administration </plain></SENT>
