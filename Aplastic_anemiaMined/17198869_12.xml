<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: Although a number of reports have documented a significantly increased incidence of HLA-DR15 in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA), the exact role of HLA-DR15 in the immune mechanisms of AA remains unclear </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We herein clarify the difference between DRB1( *)1501 and DRB1( *)1502, the two DRB1 alleles that determine the presentation of HLA-DR15, in the pathophysiology of AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated the relationships of the patients( *) HLA-DRB1 allele with both the presence of a small population of CD55(-)CD59(-) (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>-type) blood cells and the response to antithymocyte globulin (ATG) plus cyclosporin (CsA) therapy in 140 Japanese AA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 30 different DRB1 alleles, only DRB1( *)1501 (33.6% vs 12.8%, p(c) &lt; 0.01) and DRB1( *)1502 (43.6% vs 24.4%, p(c) &lt; 0.01) displayed significantly higher frequencies among the AA patients than among a control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>AA patients possessing HLA-DR15 tended to be old, and especially, the frequency of DRB1( *)1502 in patients 40 years of age and older (52.4%) was markedly higher than that in those younger than 40 years old (16.2%, p(c) &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Only DRB1( *)1501 was significantly associated with the presence of a small population of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>-type cells and it also showed a good response to ATG plus CsA therapy in a univariate analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A multivariate analysis showed only the presence of a small population of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>-type cells to be a significant factor associated with a good response to the immunosuppressive therapy (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Although both DRB1( *)1501 and DRB1( *)1502 contribute to the development of AA, the methods of contribution differ between the two alleles </plain></SENT>
