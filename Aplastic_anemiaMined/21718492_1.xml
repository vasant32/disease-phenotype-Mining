<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fanconi <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>Anemia</z:hpo> (FA) is the most common representative of inherited <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> syndromes (IBMFS) with a leukemic propensity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>P 53 DNA alteration has not been studied before in Egyptian children with FA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: we investigated p53 mutation in the bone marrow and peripheral blood of forty children, FA (n = 10), acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AAA) (n = 10), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001973'>immune thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi>) as a control (n = 20), using real-time PCR by TaqMan probe assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Mutation of p53 gene was demonstrated in the BM of 90% (9/10) of children with FA, compared to 10% (1/10) in AAA (p &lt; 0.001), while, no p53 DNA mutation was seen in the control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A positive correlation between DNA breakage and presence of p53 mutation was seen in FA (p &lt; 0.02, r0.81) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: mutation of p53 gene in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151773" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoplastic marrow</z:e> especially FA may represent an early indicator of significant DNA genetic alteration with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> propensity </plain></SENT>
