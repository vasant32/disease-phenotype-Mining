<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0000334'>Agranulocytosis</z:mp> and aplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> are rare but serious conditions known to be caused by numerous drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Most of what is known or suspected about the aetiology is based on case reports, with only a few formal epidemiological studies that provide quantitative estimates of risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Updated results have been obtained from a combined analysis of data from 3 case-control studies that used similar methods: the International <z:mp ids='MP_0000334'>Agranulocytosis</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>Aplastic Anemia</z:hpo> Study (IAAAS), conducted in Israel and Europe; a study conducted in the northeast US; and a study conducted in Thailand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Totals of 362 cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0000334'>agranulocytosis</z:mp>, 454 cases of aplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> and 6458 controls were included in the analyses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The IAAAS and Thai study were population-based, providing estimates of the incidence of the 2 dyscrasias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The overall annual incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0000334'>agranulocytosis</z:mp> in the ambulatory population was 3.4/10(6) in the IAAAS and 0.8/10(6) in Thailand; by contrast the incidence of aplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> was 2.0/10(6) in the IAAAS and 4.1/10(6) in Thailand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A total of 21 compounds were significantly associated with an increased risk of <z:mp ids='MP_0000334'>agranulocytosis</z:mp> in the IAAAS and US studies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Excess risks ranged from 0.06 to 13 cases/10(6) users/wk; the most strongly associated drugs were <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8428">procainamide</z:chebi>, anti-thyroid drugs and sulphasalazine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>An association with drugs that had previously been suspected was also seen in Thailand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The overall aetiologic fractions of <z:mp ids='MP_0000334'>agranulocytosis</z:mp> due to drug use were 62% in the IAAAS, 72% in the US and 70% in Thailand </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Eleven drugs were significantly associated with an increased risk of aplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo>, with excess risks ranging from 1.4 to 60 cases/10(6) users in a 5-month period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The most strongly associated drugs were <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50868,7959">penicillamine</z:chebi>, gold and carbamazepine </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Aetiologic fractions were 27% in the IAAAS, 17% in the US and 2% in Thailand, which paralleled the prevalence of use of associated drugs in the 3 populations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The present results confirm that <z:mp ids='MP_0000334'>agranulocytosis</z:mp> is largely a drug-induced disease, with similar proportions accounted for in 3 disparate geographic regions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>By contrast, although many of the expected associations were observed for aplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo>, most of the aetiology is not explained by drugs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>For <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> associated drugs, the excess risks are sufficiently low that <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">blood dyscrasias</z:e> should not figure prominently in the balancing of risks and benefits </plain></SENT>
