<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0000334'>Agranulocytosis</z:mp>, a syndrome characterized by a marked reduction in circulating granulocytes, is strongly associated with medical drug use in Europe and the United States </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Unregulated use of common pharmaceutical agents in developing countries has been suspected of causing large numbers of cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0000334'>agranulocytosis</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo>, especially among children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To elucidate the incidence and etiology of <z:mp ids='MP_0000334'>agranulocytosis</z:mp> in Thailand, a population-based case-control study of symptomatic <z:mp ids='MP_0000334'>agranulocytosis</z:mp> that resulted in hospital admission was conducted in Bangkok from 1990 to 1994 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An attempt was also made to study the disease in Khonkaen (in northeastern Thailand) and Songkla (in southern Thailand), but there were insufficient cases in the latter regions, and the analysis was confined to subjects from Bangkok </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In that region, the overall incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0000334'>agranulocytosis</z:mp> was 0.8 per million per year; there were no <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>As expected, the incidence was higher in females (0.9 per million), and it increased with age (4.3 per million beyond age 60) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among 25 cases and 529 controls the relative risk estimate for a combined category of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> suspect drugs was 9.2 (95% confidence interval = 3.9-21), and the proportion of cases that could be attributed to drug use was 68% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>For individual drugs and drug classes the data were sparse; within these limitations, the strongest association appeared to be with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50671">antithyroid drugs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One case and three controls were exposed to dipyrone, a drug known to cause <z:mp ids='MP_0000334'>agranulocytosis</z:mp>; with such scanty data the risk could not be evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Exposure to pesticides or solvents was not associated with an increased risk </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This is the first formal epidemiologic study of <z:mp ids='MP_0000334'>agranulocytosis</z:mp> in a developing country </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>As in the West, most cases are attributable to medical drug use </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, the incidence of <z:mp ids='MP_0000334'>agranulocytosis</z:mp> in Bangkok, and apparently, in Thailand as a whole, is unusually low, and the disease does not pose a public health risk </plain></SENT>
