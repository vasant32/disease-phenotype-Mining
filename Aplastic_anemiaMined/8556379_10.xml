<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Symptoms (local swelling and pain in the jaw, necrotic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000230'>gingivitis</z:hpo>, and spontaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0006480'>loss of teeth</z:hpo>) appeared 3 weeks, 4 weeks, and 8 months after diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, and 8 days posttransplant in a patient with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three had the process in the mandible and one in the maxilla </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Specific diagnoses of Aspergillus flavus, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Actinomyces species were obtained histologically from surgical samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment was radical surgery to remove <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> infected and necrotic tissue: removal of a substantial part of the mandible and loss of seven to eight permanent teeth in those with mandibular lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0001261" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Actinomycosis</z:e> was treated with <z:chebi fb="93" ids="17334">penicillin</z:chebi> for 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The patients with fungal lesions received <z:chebi fb="1" ids="2682">amphotericin B</z:chebi> for 2, 5, and 6 months, with adjuvant <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6076">itraconazole</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="2" ids="46081">fluconazole</z:chebi>, or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5100">5-fluorocytosine</z:chebi> for 9-12 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Anti-<z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> chemotherapy was continued </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the bony lesions healed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004808'>acute myeloid leukemia</z:hpo> died in relapse 1 year postdiagnosis; her aspergillus <z:hpo ids='HP_0002754'>osteomyelitis</z:hpo> had been inactive for 8 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The other three patients are alive and well 1.9, 2.1, and 1.9 years after termination of antimicrobial therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: We emphasize the necessity of specific diagnosis from appropriate surgical samples and conclude that in patients undergoing chemotherapy bony lesions caused by opportunistic microorganisms may be curable with aggressive surgery and prolonged medication </plain></SENT>
