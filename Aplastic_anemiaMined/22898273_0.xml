<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The medical data of 110 children with AA who received IST between February 2003 and November 2009 were retrospectively studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of these patients, 83 were diagnosed as severe AA (SAA) and 27 were non-SAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The former group was treated with antithymocyte globulin (ATG) + <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">ciclosporin</z:chebi> (CSA) +<z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> + <z:chebi fb="5" ids="50113">androgens</z:chebi> and the latter with CSA + <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> + <z:chebi fb="5" ids="50113">androgens</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Total response rates in the SAA and non-SAA groups were 69.9% and 70.4%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Univariate analysis showed that disease duration, CD34+ cell level in bone marrow (BM) and the expression of CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cell in BM were related to the severity of disease but not correlated with treatment response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Age, disease duration and proportions of CD3+ and CD8+ T cells in BM were predictive factors for response to IST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis revealed that patients aged more than 10 years and patients with a CD8+ cell proportion in BM of over 25% had hazard ratios of 3.36 and 3.59 for treatment failure respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: IST is effective in the treatment of childhood AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Age, disease duration and the proportion of CD8+ T cell in BM are predictive factors for response to IST </plain></SENT>
