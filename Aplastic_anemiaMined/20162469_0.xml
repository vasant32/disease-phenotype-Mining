<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>At 51 months post-transplant, we attempted bone marrow biopsy from her posterior iliac crest, but failed to penetrate the cortical bone </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Retrospective analysis of computed tomography revealed the gradual replacement of sternal, vertebral, and pelvic bone marrow with calcified tissues in addition to the dispersed calcification of the liver, spleen, and kidneys over the last 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The bone mineral density of the lumbar spine had increased but not that of the femoral neck </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Biomedical parameters for bone remodeling demonstrated enhanced bone formation as well as bone resorption and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000867'>secondary hyperparathyroidism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
