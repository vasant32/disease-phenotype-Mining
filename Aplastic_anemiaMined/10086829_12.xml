<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Hospital charts and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> registration data were utilized to apply strict diagnostic criteria to case identification </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Estimates of the annual incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and <z:mp ids='MP_0000334'>agranulocytosis</z:mp> were 2.7 and 3.0 per million, which are similar to those from other recent population-based studies with comparable case identification criteria </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Only a small number of cases were available to evaluate potential drug causes, leading to an analysis of limited power </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, significant associations were found between <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and tocainide, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="33972">gold salts</z:chebi>, and antidepressants; and between <z:mp ids='MP_0000334'>agranulocytosis</z:mp> and anti-thyroids, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="45924">trimethoprim</z:chebi>-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="9332">sulfamethoxazole</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35627">beta-lactams</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="9334">sulfasalazine</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="6" ids="3647">chlorpromazine</z:chebi>, carbamazepine, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="5441">glyburide</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8428">procainamide</z:chebi>, although the associations with antibiotics may indicate a response to the disorders rather than a possible cause </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These findings are generally consistent with the results of other case-control investigations </plain></SENT>
