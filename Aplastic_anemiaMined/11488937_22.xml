<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Both the GST mu 1 (GSTM1) and GST theta 1 (GSTT1) genes have a null variant allele in which the entire gene is absent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In this study, we tested whether null genotypes for the GSTM1 and GSTT1 genes altered the risks for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> and AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Genomic DNA from 49 MDS, 38 AML and 37 AA patients and 276 controls was analysed using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The frequencies of GSTM1 (73.6%) and GSTT1 (34.2%) null genotypes were significantly higher in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> patients than in the controls (36.9 and 18.1%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A higher frequency of the combined null genotype for both genes was also observed in patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (26.3% compared with 5.0% in the controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In contrast, no differences in the frequencies of the null genotypes were found among <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients, AA patients and the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Our observation of a 4.7-fold (95% CI: 2.1-11.0) and 2.3-fold (95% CI: 1.0-5.2) increased risk associated with the GSTM1 and GSTT1 null genotypes, respectively, and a 6.6-fold (95% CI: 2.4-7.9) increased risk associated with the combined null genotype presents preliminary evidence that the inherited absence of this carcinogen detoxification pathway may be an important determinant of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
