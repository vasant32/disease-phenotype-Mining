<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A method based on liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was developed and validated for the qualitative and quantitative detection of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17698">chloramphenicol</z:chebi> (CAP) in seafood samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The analysis of CAP residues in seafood is important because CAP can cause serious <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> reactions in humans, including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The proposed methodology includes a cleanup solid-phase extraction procedure with high recovery efficiency (&gt;90%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Chromatographic separation of CAP and the internal standard (IS) was carried out on a C(18) column, followed by mass spectrometric detection using electrospray ionization in the negative-ion mode </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The precursor/product ion transitions 321--&gt;257 (CAP) and 354--&gt;290 (IS) were monitored </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Statistical evaluation of this multiple reaction monitoring mass spectrometric procedure reveals good linearity, accuracy, and inter- and intraday precisions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The limit of detection was 0.1 ng/mL, and the limit of quantification for CAP in seafood samples is 0.02 microg/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Application in seafood samples allowed the detection of CAP in low parts per billion levels </plain></SENT>
