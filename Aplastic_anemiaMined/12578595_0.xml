<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The conditioning regimen was consisted of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi> (18 mg/kg), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (200 mg/kg), thiotepa (6 mg/kg) and horse anti-thymocyte globulin (110 mg/kg) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The nucleated cells (10.6 x 10(9)/kg) and CD34(+) CD38(-) cells (11.7 x 10(6)/kg) were infused </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At +14 days PBSCT, ANC and WBC achieved 0.66 x 10(9)/L and 1.4 x 10(9)/L respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The engraftment was successful but the patient depended on transfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The range of blood WBC was from 1.4 x 10(9)/L to 2.4 x 10(9)/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The myelogram showed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Hematopoiesis was restored continually after the second transfusion of the donor's cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>At +11 days the patient was suffered from cutaneous aGVHD grade II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>Diarrhea</z:hpo> occurred at +33 day when cutaneous aGVHD had been improved, and exaggerated obviously after the second transfusion at +39 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The serious <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> continued for 2 months and intestinal aGVHD grade IV was finally diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our conclusion was that intestinal aGVHD possibly occurred even when cutaneous aGVHD was improved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>For a patient with refractory <z:hpo ids='HP_0002014'>diarrhea</z:hpo> after allo-PBSCT, intestinal aGVHD was considered first when the engraftment evidence was definited but peripheral blood cells and bone marrow were abnormal </plain></SENT>
