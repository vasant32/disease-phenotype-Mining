<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CASE: Repeated maternal plasma exchanges (N = 40) beginning at 7 weeks' gestation were used to treat severe anti-Kell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948201" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">alloimmunization</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Ultrasound examination at 19 weeks' gestation revealed diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>hydrops</z:hpo> in this fetus (umbilical venous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi>, 1.2 g/dL), which then required nine intrauterine transfusions through 34 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A healthy 3840-g girl was delivered by cesarean delivery at 36 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Despite <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> during the first 3 months of life, she is healthy and has no observable abnormalities at age 8 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: A highly aggressive course of plasmapheresis and intrauterine transfusions can successfully treat fetal <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> caused by anti-Kell <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0948201" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">alloimmunization</z:e> even when fetal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> is extremely low </plain></SENT>
