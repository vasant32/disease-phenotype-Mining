<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, at least 50% of the etiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> remains unexplained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a case-control, multicenter, multinational study, designed to identify risk factors for <z:mp ids='MP_0000334'>agranulocytosis</z:mp> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cases were patients with diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> confirmed through biopsy or bone marrow <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo>, selected through an active search of clinical laboratories, hematology clinics and medical records </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The controls did not have either <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A total of 224 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> were included in the study, each case was paired with four controls, according to sex, age group, and hospital where the case was first seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Information was collected on demographic data, medical history, laboratory tests, medications, and other potential risk factors prior to diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> was 1.6 cases per million per year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Higher rates of <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> exposure (&gt;/=30 exposures per year) were associated with a greater risk of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (odds ratio, OR: 4.2; 95% confidence interval, CI: 1.82-9.82) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Individuals exposed to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17698">chloramphenicol</z:chebi> in the previous year had an adjusted OR for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> of 8.7 (CI: 0.87-87.93) and those exposed to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2955">azithromycin</z:chebi> had an adjusted OR of 11.02 (CI 1.14-108.02) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Conclusions The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> in Latin America countries is low </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although the research study centers had a high coverage of health services, the underreporting of cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> in selected regions can be discussed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Frequent exposure to <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi>-based products increases the risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Few associations with specific drugs were found, and it is likely that some of these were due to chance alone </plain></SENT>
