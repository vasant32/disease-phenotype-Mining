<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> with excess blasts in transformation (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RAEB</z:e>-t) were conditioned with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> and total body irradiation (1400 cGy) and were treated with FLI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In spite of such intensive conditioning, one patient recovered autologous hemopoiesis 3 weeks later, remaining in remission 4 years after this procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The second patient died with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1368107" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">aplastic marrow</z:e> on day 154, and the third suffered from severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> refractory to several types of conventional treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After FLI and without previous conditioning therapy a partial fetal engraftment was documented </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This was transient and followed by autologous hemopoietic recovery and cure of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The fourth patient had <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> in the setting of a severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> following autologous bone marrow transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Ten days after FLI the hematological parameters dramatically improved and the <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> resolved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Autologous reconstitution of hemopoiesis was demonstrated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These experiences suggest that FLI might stimulate autologous hemopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This therapeutic approach may be useful to treat <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> when there is no response to first-line therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancies</z:e> with an indication for stem cell transplantation, other sources such as allogeneic or autologous bone marrow seem preferable to fetal liver cells </plain></SENT>
