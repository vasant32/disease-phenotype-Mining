<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The appropriate management of patients with moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (mAA) remains to be unclear and controversial </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A cohort of 118 patients with mAA received a novel immunosuppressive strategy of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> alternately combined with levamisole (CSA and LMS regimen), which included 42 newly diagnosed and 76 <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> (disease duration &gt;6 months) cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>CSA and LMS regimen was orally administrated with the initial dose of CSA 3 mg/kg per day in adults or 5 mg/kg per day in children, and LMS 150 mg per day in adults or 2.5 mg/kg per day in children, continued for 12 more months after achieving maximal hematologic response, followed by a slow tapering </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The overall response rates were of 100 and 86.8 % for newly diagnosed and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> group, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 24-month progression-free survival were 95.2 % (95 % confidence intervals [CI], 85.9-100 %) and 93.6 % (95 % CI, 86.9-100 %) for newly diagnosed and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> group, respectively (P = 0.50) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The 2-year event-free survival for the patients in newly diagnosed group (86.6 %; 95 % CI, 70.4-100 %) was superior to that in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> group (57.0 %; 95 % CI, 43.5-70.4 %, P = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>To date, 11 patients relapsed and no patients evolved to clonal disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, CSA and LMS regimen represents a promising immunosuppressive strategy for mAA </plain></SENT>
