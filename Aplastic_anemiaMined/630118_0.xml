<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Discontinuation of the drugs was followed by a decline in both HbF and total Hb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Reinstitution of the combined steroids prompted a second rise in total and fetal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>During these responses the subject's erythrocytes exhibited an increased i antigen score and a low level of red cell carbonic anhydrase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The glycine:alanine ratio at position 136 of the gamma chains of HbF was of the fetal type (proportion of chains with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29947">glycine residues</z:chebi>, 0.74) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">Hemoglobin</z:chebi> A2 was low (0.4%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The synthesis of alpha and non-alpha chains was balanced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that the stimulation of red cell proliferation in this subject, in response to <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi> therapy, resulted in the production of cells with several characteristics of "fetal" erythrocytes </plain></SENT>
