<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Our patient had severe transfusion-dependent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, which responded to treatment with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> on two occasions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The exacerbations of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> were associated with lymphocytic proliferation which on one occasion had the characteristics of T-cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0005550'>chronic lymphocytic leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Though he had had mild lymphoproliferation for a number of years, he ultimately died with progressive diffuse lymphoid infiltration of the bone marrow and other organs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The simultaneous occurrence of the T-cell lymphoproliferation and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and their simultaneous response to therapy suggests that this may be a clinical example of T-lymphocyte mediated suppression of erythropoiesis </plain></SENT>
