<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Five hundred erythroid and myeloid cells, as well as 20 megakaryocytes were counted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Dysplastic changes were defined if morphological changes were present in more than 1.0% cells with only one lineage, or in more than 0.6% cells with more than two lineages </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty six of 39 patients with AA showed morphological abnormalities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> cases, morphological abnormalities were prominent in trilineage cells in some cases, in bilineage (erythroid and megakaryocytic or myeloid and megakaryocytic cells), in others, or solely in myeloid cells or in megakaryocytic cells in other cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Morphological abnormalities seen solely in erythroid cells, especially those with segmented nuclei were considered to be less significant for the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
