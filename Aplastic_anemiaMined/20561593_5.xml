<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively analyzed 71 patients (median age, 13 years; 28 adults) with SAA (9 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004818'>paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</z:hpo> [<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>]) who received a single-unit (n = 57; 79%) or double-unit UCBT (n = 14; 19%) in 32 centers between 1996 and 2009 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A reduced-intensity conditioning regimen was provided in 68% of the patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cumulative incidence (CI) of neutrophil recovery was 51% ± 6% at day 60, with significantly better engraftment seen in recipients of higher prefreezing total nucleated cell (TNC) dose (&gt;3.9 10(7)/kg; hazard ratio [HR], 1.5; P = .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The CI of platelet engraftment at day 180 posttransplantation was 37% ± 7%, that of grade II-IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD was 20% ± 5%, and that of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD at 3 years was 18% ± 5% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At a median follow-up of 35 months (range, 3-83 months), the estimated probability of 3-year overall survival (OS) was 38% ± 6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Significantly improved OS was seen in recipients of &gt;3.9 10(7) TNCs/kg prefreezing (45%, compared with 18% for recipients of ≤ 3.9 10(7) TNC/kg; HR, 0.4; P = .007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These results highlight the fundamental role of cell dose for both engraftment and OS in patients with SAA undergoing UCBT </plain></SENT>
