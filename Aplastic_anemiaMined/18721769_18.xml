<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The outcome of 31 SAA patients (median age 28; range: 0.9-72.3 years old) who received UCBT was analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The cumulative incidences of the neutrophil and platelet recovery after UCBT were 54.8 and 72.2%, respectively (95% confidence interval [CI] = 36.0%-70.3% and 51.3%-85.3%, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The cumulative incidences of grade &gt; or =II <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (aGVHD, cGVHD) were 17.1% (95% CI = 6.2%-32.8%) and 19.7% (95% CI = 6.2%-38.8%), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Currently, 13 patients are alive, having survived for 33.7 months (median; range: 6-77 months) after UCBT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The probability of overall survival (OS) at 2 years was 41.1% (95% CI = 23.8%-57.7%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A conditioning regimen that included low-dose total body irradiation (TBI) (2-5 Gy), fludarabine, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> resulted in a favorable OS (80%; 95% CI = 20.4%-96.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>This result suggests that UCBT using the optimal conditioning regimen can be a salvage treatment for patients without a suitable bone marrow donor and warrants evaluation in further prospective studies </plain></SENT>
