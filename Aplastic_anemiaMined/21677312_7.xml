<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Increasing use of peripheral blood stem and progenitor cells (PBPCs) instead of BM as a graft source prompted us to compare outcomes of PBPC and BM transplantation for SAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We studied 296 patients receiving either BM (n = 225) or PBPC (n = 71) from unrelated donors matched at human leukocyte antigen-A, -B, -C, -DRB1 </plain></SENT>
