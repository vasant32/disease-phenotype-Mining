<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, rabbit ATG with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> A has been used as a first-line IST regimen in patients with SAA because of unavailability of horse ATG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively analyzed adult SAA patients who were treated with horse ATG (n = 46) or rabbit ATG (n = 53) between Feb 2001 and May 2010 to compare hematologic response and survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Overall response rates at 3, 6, 12, and 18 months were similar in both the horse and rabbit ATG groups: 28.3 versus 35.8 % (P = 0.421), 39.1 versus 45.3 % (P = 0.537), 45.7 versus 49.1 % (P = 0.735), and 47.8 versus 50.9 % (P = 0.757), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The complete response (CR) rate at 6 months in the horse ATG was significantly superior in comparison with the rabbit ATG (13.0 versus 1.9 %, P = 0.031) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>But CR rates became similar in both groups after 6 months: 17.4 versus 11.3 % (P = 0.387) at 12 months and 21.7 versus 22.6 % (P = 0.914) at 18 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Lymphocyte <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> after ATG was more profound and protracted in the rabbit ATG group compared to the horse ATG group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall survival (P = 0.460) and failure-free survival (P = 0.911) were not significantly different between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Our retrospective study demonstrated that the efficacy of first-line IST with rabbit ATG is similar to that with horse ATG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, the time from treatment to CR was longer with rabbit ATG than with horse ATG, partly due to more profound and protracted lymphocyte <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
