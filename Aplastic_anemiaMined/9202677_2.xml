<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Particularly in patients having undergone bone marrow transplantation, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0035204" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">respiratory diseases</z:e> account for a significant number of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In a retrospective study, we evaluated 41 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> who were operated on consecutively from 1980 to 1995 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Fourteen open lung biopsies, four video-assisted lung biopsies, and 24 lung resections were performed in 24 male and 17 female patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Mean age was 32.2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Eleven (27%) early <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> occurred (30-day mortality): ten in patients after lung biopsy (56%) and one after lung resection (4%) (p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Perioperative morbidity relating to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024115" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary disease</z:e> or operation included 10 (24.4%) cases of prolonged (&gt; 24 hours) postoperative mechanical ventilation and two (4.8%) cases of <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> or <z:mp ids='MP_0008817'>hematoma</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In one (2.4%) patient a slowly developing, contained bronchial stump insufficiency appeared after lobectomy, which was successfully operated on 3 weeks later </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: We conclude that resection of localized pulmonary lesions, be it for diagnostic or therapeutic (or combined) purposes, can be carried out with low morbidity and mortality in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, early mortality is high after open or thoracoscopic lung biopsies in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute-onset</z:hpo> diffuse <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024115" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">pulmonary disease</z:e>, and little therapeutic benefit is realized in these cases </plain></SENT>
