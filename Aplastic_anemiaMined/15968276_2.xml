<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The median age was 17 years (range, 6--9), and the median time between diagnosis and transplant 1 month (range, 1--4) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Conditioning consisted of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (50 mg/kg per day) on days--7 to--4 and antithymocyte globulin (30 mg/kg per day) on days--4 to--2 in nine patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Total lymphoid irradiation was added to the preparative regimen for two </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">Graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) prophylaxis consisted of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> A and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Median doses of CD34+ and CD3+ cells infused were 3.91 x 10(6) and 0.3 x 10(6)/kg, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The median time taken to achieve a neutrophil count &gt;0.5 x 10(9)/l was 12 days and to recover a platelet count &gt;20 x 10(9)/l, 13 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two patients developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD grade I--II and one developed limited <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There were two treatment-related <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>At a median follow-up of 44 months (range, 4--3), nine patients were alive with sustained and complete engraftment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>This is a promising procedure in patients with AA, resulting in a rapid hematopoietic recovery, a low transplant-related mortality, and a low incidence of GVHD </plain></SENT>
