<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0001908'>hypoplastic anemia</z:hpo> of unknown etiology had not existed until now </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To assess pathophysiological differentiation in childhood <z:hpo ids='HP_0001908'>hypoplastic anemia</z:hpo>, we analyzed red cell membrane components in six children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001908'>hypoplastic anemia</z:hpo> of unknown etiology </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The six children <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> had <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They also showed <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0151773" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hypoplastic marrow</z:e> cellularity with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0877221" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">erythroblastopenia</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005548'>megakaryocytopenia</z:hpo>, and mild morphological anomalies (pelger HÃ«ut anomaly of neutrophils and bi- or trinuclear erythroblasts), except for one child who had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> platelets and megakaryocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Red blood cells of patients and several anemic children, cord blood and healthy controls were analyzed by the peanut lectin agglutination (<z:chebi fb="3" ids="48021">PNA</z:chebi>) test, flow cytometry, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8984">sodium dodecyl sulfate</z:chebi>_<z:chebi fb="0" ids="53656">polyacrylamide</z:chebi> gel electrophoresis of membrane proteins, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) of sugar chains and the colony-forming assay of bone marrow erythroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the six children, the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="48021">PNA</z:chebi> agglutination test showed a persistent positive reaction not only for peripheral red blood cells but also for bone marrow erythroblasts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This was not observed in other anemic children and healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With HPLC analysis, the sugar chains of red blood cell membranes showed the loss of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26667">sialic acid</z:chebi> from O-linked <z:chebi fb="2" ids="50699">oligosaccharides</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggested that the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001877'>abnormality of red blood cells</z:hpo> from these patients was attributable to abnormal surface sugar chains (loss of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="26667">sialic acid</z:chebi> from O-glycan), which are already present at the erythroblast stage in the bone marrow and that may be responsible for a group of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
