<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Most patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (sAA) respond to immunosuppression, but a significant number relapse or develop clonal abnormalities such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0004818'>paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplasia</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In principle, patients without matched sibling donors and older patients might benefit from transplantation of autologous hematopoietic peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPCs) obtained during remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Even patients who have clinically recovered from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> have diminished hematopoietic progenitor cells, so the practicability of PBPC mobilization in these individuals is unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The feasibility of PBPC mobilization in nine patients with a history of sAA was evaluated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (10 microg/kg) was administered subcutaneously for 5 days and followed by a 12-L leukapheresis procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Only two of the nine patients had sufficient mobilization of CD34 cells to merit collection; in these cases sufficient CD34 cells were obtained for autologous transplantation should the need arise </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: PBPC collection is feasible only in a fraction of recovered AA patients </plain></SENT>
