<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>One hundred and twenty two patients received transplants for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>; engraftment was reported in 4 patients; <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GvHD) did not occur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Complete and partial responses were reported in one-half of patients, the majority of whom had no evidence of engraftment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirty-nine patients received transplants for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transient engraftment was reported in 40% and two developed GvHD; survival extended to more than 2 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The higher rate of engraftment in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> suggests a role of pretransplant immune suppression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The risk of GvHD appears to be low despite complete HLA-mismatching </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data suggest a possible role for fetal liver transplantation in man </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Future studies should probably be based on preclinical data obtained in large animal models </plain></SENT>
