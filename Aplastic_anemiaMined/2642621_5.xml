<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Six patients had an HLA-matched sibling and underwent allogeneic bone marrow transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Nine patients who lacked a suitable donor were given immunosuppressive therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Antithymocyte globulin was the initial treatment for eight of these nine patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Two patients who failed to respond to antithymocyte globulin were then treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pretreatment age, hematologic measurements, duration of follow-up, and interval prior to therapy were similar between the two groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the patients receiving bone marrow transplants had a complete response and now have <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> blood cell counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Six of nine patients (67%) responded to antithymocyte globulin and are now transfusion free, although three have mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Both patients given <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> A had a good response and are also transfusion free </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients who underwent marrow transplantation had a significantly shorter period of transfusion dependence for RBCs (9 v 4 weeks, P less than .005) and platelets (5 v 21 weeks, P less than .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The patients given immunosuppressive therapy have significantly lesser platelet counts in follow-up but have similar values for both <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> and absolute granulocyte counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Although HLA-matched bone marrow transplantation leads to a faster and more complete recovery for children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, immunosuppressive therapy can provide a good outcome for children with this disorder </plain></SENT>
