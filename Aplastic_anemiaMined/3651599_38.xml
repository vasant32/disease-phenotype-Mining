<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Sixty-four patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> were treated with antilymphocyte globulin (ALG Merieux) between 1980 and 1985 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The actuarial survival for <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients was 53% at 6 years, with 79% survival for nonsevere <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (NSAA) and 36% for severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (SAA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The neutrophil and platelet counts before treatment with ALG were highly predictive of survival, whereas sex, age, and etiology were not </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Duration of disease prior to ALG treatment was inversely related to survival, although this was not statistically significant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Survival was closely associated with response to ALG, especially for patients with SAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The response to one course of ALG was 33% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eighteen patients who did not respond to an initial course of ALG received a second course; of these, four (22%) responded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The overall response to one or two courses of ALG was 40% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The mean RBC volume (MCV) measured after ALG treatment was a useful early indicator of response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both the minimum lymphocyte count during ALG therapy and the mean lymphocyte count after therapy, however, were not significantly different between responders and nonresponders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The disappointing survival of patients with SAA in this study may reflect the poor clinical condition of severely affected patients referred to us and/or the presence of longstanding <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The importance of studying a large series of patients with long-term follow-up to assess ALG in the treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> is shown by this investigation </plain></SENT>
