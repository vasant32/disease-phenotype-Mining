<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: Immature platelet fraction (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IPF</z:e>) is the percentage of reticulated platelet (RP) of total platelet count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We measured an <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IPF</z:e> reference range using XE-2100 blood cell counter with upgraded software (Sysmex, Japan) and evaluated the clinical utility of this parameter for the laboratory diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> due to an increase in peripheral platelet destruction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Peripheral blood samples collected into K2EDTA (Beckton Dickinson, USA) were analyzed at Chonbuk National University Hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>One hundred forty-two samples from apparently healthy adults (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> routine full blood count parameters including platelets within the healthy reference range) were used to establish a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> reference range for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IPF</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients were classified into 3 groups including hypoplastic (consisted of 22 patients undergoing chemotherapy with falling platelet counts and 14 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>), cirrhotic (40 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo> of liver), and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001973'>idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi>) (14 with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi>) groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: An <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IPF</z:e> reference range in healthy individuals was established as 0.4-5.4%, with a mean of 1.7% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>A significant increase in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IPF</z:e> values was found in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> patient group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The cut-off value of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IPF</z:e> was 6.1% and its sensitivity and specificity were 92.9%, and 82.9% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Reproducibility was good </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: A rapid, inexpensive automated method for measuring <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">IPF</z:e> is feasible and should become a standard parameter in evaluating thrombocytopenic patients </plain></SENT>
