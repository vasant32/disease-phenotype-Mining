<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: After the model of AA was established, the animals were fed with 0.2 ml of 100% CBAD, twice a day for 12 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Te CD49 d and cyclin D2 expression level of bone marrow hematopoietic cells in model mice were measured by flow cytometor analysis system at the 13th day of experiment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: CD49 d expression level in CBAD group was significantly higher than that in the AA group (P &lt; 0.05), and was similar to that in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> group (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The expression of cyclin D2 in CBAD group was significantly higher than that in the AA group (P &lt; 0.01), but the cell count of G0 + G1 phase was significantly lower in the CBAD group, as compared with the AA group, P &lt; 0.01 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: CBAD can increase the expression of adherent molecule CD49 d and cyclin D2 in bone marrow hematopoietic cells, and promote the growth of hematopoietic cells </plain></SENT>
