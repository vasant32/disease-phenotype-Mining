<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>There was good correlation between the erythrocyte cellularity of the marrow and the In-111 bone-marrow scan grades in most patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In some, the overall scan grade tended to underestimate the erythroid elements because the core biopsy had been taken from the area of the greatest radionuclide concentration on the scan </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, there was good correlation between the plasma iron clearance t1/2 and the scan grade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Less agreement was found in the comparison between the Fe-59 sacral and organ counts and the red-cell iron utilization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011974'>myelofibrosis</z:hpo>, there was poor correlation between the surface counts over the sacrum and the red-cell iron utilization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Plasma iron clearances were abnormally short and were unrelated to the transferrin saturation levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Eighteen patients were studied several times to evaluate their responses to steroid therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, there was good correlation between the bone-marrow imaging, the erythrocyte cellularity, ferrokinetics, and the patient's response to therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="1" ids="30430">Indium</z:chebi>-111 bone-marrow imaging is useful both in evaluating marrow erythroid activity and in following the response to therapy in patients with these diseases </plain></SENT>
