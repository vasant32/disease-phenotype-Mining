<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, the intensive treatment may increase the risk of late complications which may impair the patients' quality of life </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In order to decrease the incidence of late complications the protocol with limited use of IF-RT was introduced in centers of Polish Pediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>Leukemia</z:hpo>/<z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>Lymphoma</z:hpo> Study Group (PPLLSG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This study presents the treatment results of patients treated with CT only in comparison with the therapy results of children treated with CT and IF-RT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>From 1997 to 2006, 634 children (age: 2-22,5 years) with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> were treated in 14 oncological centers of PPLLSG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Majority of patients received CT (3-8 cycles of MVPP/B-DOPA) combined with IF-RT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In 45 patients with IA-IIA stages presenting favorable risk factors (small <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025063" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">mediastinal tumor</z:e>, peripheral nodular mass of a maximum diameter &lt; 6 cm, involvement of less than three nodular regions, ESR &lt; 50 mm after 1 h, histologic type other than lymphocyte <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> and very good treatment response assessed after 3 CT cycles) IF-RT was omitted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Among 634 children first complete remission (RC) was not achieved in 2.4% of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Relapses occurred in 24 children (3.9%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The rates of 5-year overall survival (OS), relapse-free survival (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">RFS</z:e>) and event-free survival (EFS) were 97%, 96% i 92%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients treated with CT only remain in first CR </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Seven children died because of severe complications, among them two in first CR (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our results show that the use of CT only in precisely selected group of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">HD</z:e> do not impair the treatment results and may decrease the risk of late life threatening complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Treatment response assessment with the use of PET may in future increase the number of patients treated without RT and limit the need of the use of invasive diagnostic methods in patients with residual mass </plain></SENT>
