<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We studied 1204 recipients of HLA-matched sibling bone marrow transplantation for SAA to determine whether HLA DR15 status (as determined by allele-level typing) affected hematopoietic recovery, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD), or overall survival (OS) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In multivariate analysis, secondary graft failure rate at 2 years was lower in patients who were HLA DR15+ (hazard ratio = 0.46, P = .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, neutrophil recovery at day -28, platelet recovery at day -100, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD, and overall mortality were independent of DR15 status </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 5-year probabilities of OS, after adjusting for age, race, performance score, transplant-conditioning regimen, and year of transplantation, were 78% and 81% for patients who were HLA DR15+ and HLA DR15-, respectively (P = .35) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, DR15 status is associated with secondary graft failure after HLA-matched sibling bone marrow transplantation for SAA but has no significant impact on survival </plain></SENT>
