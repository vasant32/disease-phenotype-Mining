<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Toxicity is thought to be exerted through oxidative metabolites formed in the liver, primarily via pathways mediated by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38559">cytochrome P450</z:chebi> 2E1 (CYP2E1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="43" ids="15882">Phenol</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17594">hydroquinone</z:chebi> and trans-trans-muconaldehyde have <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> been hypothesized to be involved in <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi>-induced toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Recent reports indicate that <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> is produced in vitro and in vivo and may be sufficiently stable to reach the bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our goal was to improve existing mathematical models of microsomal <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> metabolism by including time course data for <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi>, by obtaining better parameter estimates and by determining if enzymes other than CYP2E1 are involved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Microsomes from male B6C3F1 mice and F344 rats were incubated with [(14)C]<z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> (14 microM), [(14)C]<z:chebi fb="43" ids="15882">phenol</z:chebi> (303 microM) and [(14)C]<z:chebi fb="1" ids="17594">hydroquinone</z:chebi> (8 microM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">Benzene</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="43" ids="15882">phenol</z:chebi> were also incubated with mouse microsomes in the presence of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29027">trans-dichloroethylene</z:chebi>, a CYP2E1 inhibitor, and <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> was incubated with trichloropropene <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi>, an <z:chebi fb="0" ids="32955">epoxide</z:chebi> hydrolase inhibitor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These experiments did not indicate significant contributions of enzymes other than CYP2E1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mathematical model parameters were fitted to rodent data and the model was validated by predicting human data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Model simulations predicted the qualitative behavior of three human time course data sets and explained up to 81% of the total variation in data from incubations of <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> for 16 min with microsomes from nine human individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>While model predictions did deviate systematically from the data for <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> <z:chebi fb="177" ids="25741,29356">oxide</z:chebi> and trihydroxybenzene, overall model performance in predicting the human data was good </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The model should be useful in quantifying human risk due to <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> exposure and explicitly accounts for interindividual variation in CYP2E1 activity </plain></SENT>
