<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, we have begun to explore the role of TPO in the <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSC</z:chebi> self-renewal and expansion that characterizes the post-stem-cell-transplantation period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Using limiting dilution cell transplantation analyses, we found that <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSC</z:chebi> self-renewal and expansion is reduced 10-20-fold after transplantation of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> stem cells into tpo null mice compared to their <z:mp ids='MP_0002169'>wild-type</z:mp> counterparts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Although the molecular mechanisms responsible for these findings are only now being explored, it is expected that a greater understanding of the roles played by TPO in <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSC</z:chebi> <z:mp ids='MP_0001532'>physiology</z:mp> will lead to novel therapeutic opportunities </plain></SENT>
