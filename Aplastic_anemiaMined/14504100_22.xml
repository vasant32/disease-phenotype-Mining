<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>An immune pathophysiology for acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) has been inferred from the responsiveness of the patients to immunosuppressive therapies and experimental laboratory data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To address the transcriptome of hematopoietic cells in AA, we undertook GeneChip analysis of the extremely limited numbers of progenitor and stem cells in the marrow of patients with this disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We pooled total <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> from highly enriched bone marrow CD34 cells of 36 patients with newly diagnosed AA and 12 healthy volunteers for analysis on oligonucleotide chips </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A large number of genes implicated in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> and cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> showed markedly increased expression in AA CD34 cells, and negative proliferation control genes also had increased activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Conversely, cell cycle progress-enhancing genes showed low expression in AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cytokine/chemokine signal transducer genes, stress response genes, and defense/immune response genes were up-regulated, as anticipated from other evidence of the heightened immune activity in AA patients' marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In summary, detailed genetic analysis of small numbers of hematopoietic progenitor cells is feasible even in marrow failure states where such cells are present in very small numbers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The gene expression profile of primary human CD34 hematopoietic stem cells from AA was consistent with a stressed, dying, and immunologically activated target cell population </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Many of the genes showing differential expression in AA deserve further detailed analysis, including comparison with other marrow failure states and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune disease</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
