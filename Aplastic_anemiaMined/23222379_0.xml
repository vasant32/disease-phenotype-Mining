<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MicroRNA-34 and p53 can induce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> after DNA damage.Here we assessed epithelial cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, and studied TP53 and miR-34a expression in the skin and gut biopsies in five non-transplanted FA patients, in 20 FA patients with aGVHD and in 25 acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> patients (AA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Epithelial <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> was higher in FA than in acquired AA patients in both the skin and gut biopsies, though they had a similar preparative regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Further study on gut biopsies in FA patients showed that this deleterious effect was not linked to TP53 gene overexpression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>As, among p53-independent signaling pathways of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath>, the microRNA-34 family mimics p53 apoptotic effects in response to DNA damage, we studied miR-34a expression in the same series of FA patients' gut biopsies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MiR-34a expression level was higher in severe aGVHD compared with non-aGVHD subjects or non-transplanted patients, and significantly related to apoptotic cell numbers across the three groups of FA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, in FA patients, <z:mp ids='MP_0006042'>increased apoptosis</z:mp> occurs in target epithelial cells of severe aGVHD, and this deleterious effect is linked to overexpression of miR-34a but not TP53 </plain></SENT>
