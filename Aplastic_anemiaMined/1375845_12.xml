<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, we examined the ability of recombinant human stem cell factor (SCF) to stimulate proliferation in vitro of bone marrow cells from 15 AA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had been previously treated with antilymphocyte globulin (ALG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>SCF, in combination with erythropoietin (Epo), interleukin-3 (IL-3), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), increased the number of hematopoietic colonies formed in a semisolid medium by AA marrows </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Maximal colony numbers reached 30% of the numbers observed with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Proliferation of AA cells cultured in a liquid medium containing SCF together with Epo, IL-3, GM-CSF, and G-CSF approached 70% of the control level, as measured by 3H-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="17748">thymidine</z:chebi> incorporation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The effect of the combination of SCF with the other growth factors was more than 10 times stronger than that of the growth factors alone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most marked effect of SCF was on the generation of erythroid colonies by precursor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The results demonstrate synergism between CSF and other hematopoietic growth factors, resulting in the most efficient stimulation of the in vitro growth of AA bone marrow cells described to date </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Use of SCF, either alone or in combination with other factors, may be of potential value in treatment of AA </plain></SENT>
