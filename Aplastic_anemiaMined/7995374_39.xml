<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The clinical interrelationship between <z:hpo ids='HP_0004818'>paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) promoted a search for a pathogenetic link </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since the molecular defect in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> is a failure to express phosphatidylinositol glycan-anchored proteins (PIG-AP), we investigated whether this defect could also be demonstrated on peripheral blood cells of patients with typical AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Quantification of the expression of PIG-AP was performed by flow cytometry using the monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) CD16 and CD66b for granulocytes, CD14 and CD48 for monocytes, CD48 and CD52 for lymphocytes, and CD55 and CD59 for erythrocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We analyzed cells from 52 patients with acquired AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A PIG-AP-defective population was identified in 27 of 52 patients (52%) in at least one cell lineage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Granulocytes were involved in 25 of 27, monocytes in 18 of 25, lymphocytes in seven of 27, and erythrocytes in seven of 27 AA patients who were affected by a PIG-AP deficiency </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The response rate to standard immunosuppressive therapy was significantly higher in the group of patients without a PIG-AP-deficient population than in patients with a PIG-AP-deficient population in at least one cell lineage (85.7 vs. 30.4%; p &lt; 0.0003) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Our results demonstrate that on the basis of PIG-AP expression, the proportion of AA patients who show features of typical AA along with a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> phenotype is substantially higher than previously recognized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The pattern of PIG-AP expression might identify subgroups of AA patients who differ in the underlying mechanism as well as in the course of their disease </plain></SENT>
