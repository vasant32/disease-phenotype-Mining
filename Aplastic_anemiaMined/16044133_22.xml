<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively examined risk factors for IFI among 120 consecutive pediatric patients undergoing allogeneic HCT at a single center </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The incidence of proven or probable IFI in pediatric patients during the first year after allogeneic HCT was 13%, comparable to the rate reported in adult patients; however, unlike IFI in adult patients, the majority of IFI in children occurred within the first month after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The primary risk factors for IFI were duration of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo>, age greater than 10 years, transplant for severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> or Fanconi <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, and high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroid</z:chebi> administration for 10 days or longer </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>IFI were more likely to be successfully treated (42%, 5/12 patients) in pediatric HCT recipients when compared to previous reports of adult recipients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nonrelapse mortality was estimated at 17% (20/120 patients) after allogeneic HCT, of which 35% (seven patients) were directly attributed to IFI </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Thus, IFI is a significant cause of nonrelapse mortality in children undergoing allogeneic HCT and more effective strategies are needed to prevent and treat IFI </plain></SENT>
