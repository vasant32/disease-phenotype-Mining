<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: We treated 23 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD refractory to conventional treatment and 21 patients with "high-risk" <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD (identified as having at least two of the following three risk factors: <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD that has evolved from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD, lichenoid skin or mucous-membrane changes, and hepatic dysfunction </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Therapy was continued for three months after a complete response or for six months after a partial response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall actuarial survival of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> enrolled patients was 64 percent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Survival was 76 percent among the patients receiving salvage therapy for refractory GVHD and 48 percent among those with high-risk GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>A complete response was observed in 14 patients, a partial response in 12 patients, and no response in 18 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Side effects were minor, most notably sedation in almost <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
