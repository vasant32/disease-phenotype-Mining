<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Ninety-six patients undergoing BMT for various <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1521860" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hematologic disorders</z:e> were followed for the presence of spontaneous IFN-alpha antibodies until 12 years after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seven of them (7.3%) developed IFN-alpha antibodies occurred late after BMT (&gt; or = 15 months), rose to very high titers in some patients, and persisted for years despite combined immunosuppressive treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They were oligo- or polyclonal in nature, predominantly IgG with a broad IgG subclass distribution, and neutralized the antiviral and antiproliferative activity of various natural and recombinant IFN-alpha types including the patients' endogenous IFN-alpha in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> antibody-positive recipients suffered from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD (n = 5) or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0006562'>viral hepatitis</z:hpo> (n = 2), but the only significant association was with prior severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (3/9, 33%; P = 0.022) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was no discernible HLA association of IFN antibody development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although the clinical relevance of the IFN-alpha antibodies is uncertain they may interfere with cellular defence mechanisms and immune regulation after BMT </plain></SENT>
