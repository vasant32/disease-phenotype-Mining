<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>One hundred forty-seven consecutive patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> were treated by marrow grafts from genotypically HLA-identical siblings (n = 122) or HLA-haploidentical family members (n = 25) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Haploidentical recipients differed from their donors for no more than one HLA locus on the nonshared haplotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> were given postgrafting immunosuppression with a combination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a randomized study we explored whether <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> administered from day 0 through 35 along with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> could improve prevention of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The GVHD incidence in patients not given <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> was comparable with that previously reported with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Unexpectedly, significant increases in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and also <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD were seen in HLA-identical recipients administered <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi>, but not in the small number of patients administered HLA-nonidentical grafts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, the resultant increase in transplant-related mortality in patients administered <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> was offset by an increase in leukemic relapse in patients not administered <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi>, presumably related to the absence of a graft-versus-<z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, overall disease-free survival of the two groups of patients was comparable, with slightly more than 50% of the patients being alive at more than 2 years after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We speculated that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> adversely affected GVHD prophylaxis, interfering with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi>'s cell cycle-dependent suppression of donor lymphocyte proliferation in response to host antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In a pilot study we explored whether beginning <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> on day 15, after completion of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> administration, would avoid this adverse effect </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The GVHD incidence in patients administered <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> along with "late" <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> was comparable with that in patients not administered <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>We conclude that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> is effective in decreasing the incidence of grade II through IV GVHD, and that the addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="8382">prednisone</z:chebi> to this regimen is not beneficial in recipients of HLA-identical marrow grafts </plain></SENT>
