<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In order to investigate the levels of stem cell factor (SCF) and its receptor c-kit protein and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in pediatric <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) and their relevance to the pathogenesis, immunocytochemical and in situ hybridization were utilized to detect the expression of SCF and its receptor c-kit gene protein and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi>, respectively in 59 children with AA and 51 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The relationship between SCF and c-kit and the pathogenesis of AA was analyzed subsequently </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the positive rate of SCF protein and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression in children with AA was significantly lower than that in healthy controls (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>However, there was no significant difference in the positive rate of c-kit protein and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression between children with AA and control group (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It was concluded that the expression of SCF is significantly decreased in children with AA, which may be closely associated with the pathogenesis of the AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>c-kit may be unrelated to the development of pediatric AA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Therefore, AA in children may have abnormalities at SCF/c-kit signal transduction levels </plain></SENT>
