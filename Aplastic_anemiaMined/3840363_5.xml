<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>This study included three patients with primary <z:mp ids='MP_0005638'>hemochromatosis</z:mp> and 25 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> who were receiving blood transfusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In the three patients with primary <z:mp ids='MP_0005638'>hemochromatosis</z:mp>, hemosiderin deposition was present in the acinar tissue, interstitium, islets of Langerhans, and ductal epithelium but occurred predominantly in the acinar tissue </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>Fibrosis</z:mp> was also found in the interlobular and intralobular areas in a diffuse and irregular manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A micronodular arrangement of the acinar tissue was present in the <z:mp ids='MP_0009164'>atrophic exocrine pancreas</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> who were receiving blood transfusions, the distribution and the quantity of hemosiderin approximately increased in accordance with the volume of blood given </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_127'>Atrophy</z:mpath> of the acinar tissue, interstitial <z:mp ids='MP_0003045'>fibrosis</z:mp>, and micronodular formation in the exocrine pancreas occurred in those patients who received a large volume of blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore, micronodular formation in the exocrine pancreas was one of the characteristic findings in patients with primary <z:mp ids='MP_0005638'>hemochromatosis</z:mp> and in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> who had received blood transfusions over a long period </plain></SENT>
