<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To investigated the pathogenesis of AA, the rennin activity, angiotensin I (Ang I) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2719,48432">angiotensin II</z:chebi> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="48432">Ang II</z:chebi>) concentration in peripheral blood and BM of 22 AA patients were detected by radioimmunoassay, 16 nonhematological disease patients with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> blood counts and BM picture were used as control, and the difference between two groups was compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results showed that BM <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48432">Ang II</z:chebi> concentration in the AA patients was significantly lower than that in the control (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In nonhematological disease patients, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48432">Ang II</z:chebi> concentration in BM was significantly higher than that in peripheral blood, the renin activities and Ang I concentrations were not significantly different in the two groups (P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the decreased BM <z:chebi fb="0" ids="48432">Ang II</z:chebi> concentration in AA patients may be involved to the pathogenesis of AA </plain></SENT>
