<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although PBMC from AA patients produced enhanced levels of IFN-gamma as compared to controls, this lymphokine was found not to be the main inhibitor of in vitro granulopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Other, non-IFN related factors were potent inhibitors of both the mature and the immature precursors for GM-CFC, could act across the species barrier and were of low molecular weight </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Also PBMC from healthy donors produced a non-IFN mediated GM-CFC inhibitory factor, but to a lesser degree and acting only on one type of myeloid precursors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The possible implications of these findings in relation to the etiology of AA will be discussed </plain></SENT>
