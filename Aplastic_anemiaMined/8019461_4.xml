<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one patients underwent BMT using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (CY) and 7 Gy total lymphoid irradiation (TLI) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> (CsA) plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> (MTX) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Actuarial survival is 71% at 5.3 years with an incidence of graft failure of 0% and of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD of 38.9% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Univariate analysis of variables influencing survival showed a trend for a poorer outcome in patients who received &gt; 30 transfusions prior to BMT and in male recipients from female donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Twenty-nine patients &gt; 40 years of age or without matched siblings received antithymocyte/antilymphocyte globulin (ATG/ALG) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Response rate to the first course of treatment was 46.4% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Subsequent courses of IST rescued 33% of patients who relapsed or had not responded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Actuarial survival is 62% at 8.6 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In our experience both treatment strategies have given encouraging results although overall morbidity is higher in the IST group because 25% of patients are therapy or transfusion-dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The role of irradiation in the conditioning regimen of BMT patients, recently challenged, is discussed </plain></SENT>
