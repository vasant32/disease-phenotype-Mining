<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The platelet associated immunoglobulin (PAIg) and platelet membrane <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> (CD41, CD61, GPIIb/IIIa) in 76 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001973'>immune thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> and 30 healthy subjects were determined by FCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results showed that PAIg level in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> patients included PAIgG (31.25 +/- 18.06)%, PAIgM (32.41 +/- 15.51)%, PAIgA (23.39 +/- 16.67)% which were remarkedly higher than in health control (10.48 +/- 5.05)%, (9.40 +/- 4.42)% and (7.23 +/- 3.61)% (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In patients with secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001973'>immune thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> (<z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, SLE, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0272126" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Evans syndrome</z:e>, liver <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001971'>hypersplenism</z:hpo>, etc), PAIg level was higher than that in control group, while the platelet membrane <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> in the blood of these patients was lower than that in control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The level of PAIg decreased (P &lt; 0.05) after treatment, but platelet membrane <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> increased (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The result suggested that measurements for platelet membrane <z:chebi fb="2" ids="17089">glycoprotein</z:chebi> and platelet associated antibody by FCM were practical with high sensitivity, rapidity and simplicity used as a routine method in diagnosis and evaluation of the therapeutic effects in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001973'>immune thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> patients </plain></SENT>
