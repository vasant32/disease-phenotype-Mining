<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Antithymocyte globulin (ATG) and antilymphocyte globulin (ALG) are currently used successfully for immunosuppressive treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study we have investigated whether commercial ATG/ALG preparations contain antibodies against glycosylphosphatidyl-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="24848">inositol</z:chebi> anchored proteins (GPI-AP), which could be responsible for emergence of GPI-deficient populations in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> after ATG/ALG therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analyzed four commercial ATG/ALG preparations by competitive binding assays using flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Quantification was achieved by calculating the concentration of ATG/ALG required to give 50% inhibition of binding the specific <z:chebi fb="1" ids="51217">fluorochrome</z:chebi>-labeled monoclonal antibody (EC50) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>High concentrations of antibodies against the GPI-anchored protein CD52 were found in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> preparations (Lymphoglobulin Genzyme, Thymoglobulin Genzyme, ATGAM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn, and ATG-Fresenius S Fresenius) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Antibodies against the GPI-anchored protein CD48 are present in significant concentrations except in the preparation ATGAM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CD16 antibodies were found in lower concentrations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We could not detect significant concentrations of antibodies against the GPI-anchored proteins CD157 and CD14 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Campath-1H, a monoclonal antibody against the GPI-anchored protein CD52, has been used as immunosuppressive tool for T-cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CD52 antibodies in ATG/ALG preparations might contribute in the same way to the immunosuppressive effects in treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>It is known that in a substantial proportion of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> GPI-deficient cells are present in a low level at diagnosis or emerge after immunosuppressive therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>GPI-anchored antibodies in ATG/ALG preparations might lead to a relative advantage for pre-existing GPI-deficient cells caused by an escape from the antibody-mediated attack </plain></SENT>
