<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This report examines the effect of filgrastim (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, [G-CSF] in 12 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> [absolute neutrophil count [ANC] &lt; 1,000/mm3]) caused by Fanconi <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> (FA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Two of 14 patients who were evaluated for study entry were ineligible because of unsuspected cytogenetic abnormalities in their bone marrow (BM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>G-CSF was started at 5 micrograms/kg/d </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had an increase in their ANC at week 8 (mean increase = 15,664/mm3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The median ANC during therapy was 5,030/mm3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eight of 10 patients who completed 40 weeks on study maintained an ANC &gt; 1,500/mm3 on G-CSF given every-otherday </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Four patients had an increase in their platelet count by week 8 without transfusion (maximum increase = 23,000 to 45,000/mm3); however, platelet counts fell toward baseline levels as the G-CSF dose was reduced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>BM CFU-MK were increased at week 8 in three of four evaluable patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Four patients who did not receive red blood cell transfusions had an increase in their <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> level of at least 2.0 g/dL </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>A fifth patient had a red blood cell transfusion in week 2 and then had a similar increase in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> level without subsequent transfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Eight of 10 patients who completed 40 weeks of treatment showed increases in the percentage of BM CD34+ cells measured by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The same proportion showed increases in peripheral blood CD34+ cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Increased BM cellularity and <z:mp ids='MP_0010373'>myeloid hyperplasia</z:mp> were constant findings and were associated with increased expression of the proliferating cell nuclear antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Adverse experiences were mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> (1 patient) and a new BM cytogenetic abnormality at week 40 (1 patient) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This study shows that prolonged administration of G-CSF exerts a stimulatory effect on the BM of FA patients and may be used to maintain a clinically adequate ANC in these patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>G-CSF has beneficial effects on multiple hematopoietic lineages in some patients and may be a good candidate for use in combination cytokine protocols for FA patients with progressive <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>G-CSF use results in an increase in circulating CD34+ cells, a finding with important implications for future gene transfer protocols </plain></SENT>
