<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The mechanism of FBM-induced toxicities is unknown; however, it has been proposed that 2-phenylpropenal, a reactive metabolite of FBM, is responsible </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The pathway leading to this metabolite involves hydrolysis of FBM to 2-<z:chebi fb="1" ids="30396">phenyl</z:chebi>-1,3-propandiol monocarbamate (MCF), oxidation to 3-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="23004,33100">carbamoyl</z:chebi>-2-phenylpropionaldehyde (CBMA), and spontaneous loss of carbon dioxide and ammonia </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We made a polyclonal antibody against 2-phenylpropenal bound to protein and confirmed its specificity using ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We attempted to develop an animal model of FBM-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and/or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0235378,C0348754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Injury or Poisoning" abbrv="">hepatotoxicity</z:e>, and we also used the antibody to try to detect covalent binding of 2-phenylpropenal using immunoblotting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, none of the animals developed evidence of bone marrow or liver toxicity, and we were unable to detect covalent binding, possibly because significantly less 2-phenylpropenal is formed in rodents than in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>As this type of idiosyncratic drug reaction is believed to be immune-mediated, we also studied the potential of FBM and its metabolites to stimulate an immune response using the reporter antigen popliteal lymph node assay in female Balb/c mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We found that neither FBM nor MCF induced an immune response in popliteal lymph nodes (PLNs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>However, CBMA treatment appeared immunogenic, causing footpad <z:mp ids='MP_0001845'>inflammation</z:mp>, hardening, scab formation, and an increase in thickness </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The PLN cell count in CBMA-treated mice increased 8-fold as compared to control, FBM-, or MCF-treated mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Immunohistochemical analysis of the CBMA-exposed PLNs revealed germinal center formation, indicating B cell proliferation, later confirmed by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Most of the cells expressing the activation surface marker CD54 were B cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We also found that CBMA treatment caused an increase in the production of IgM and IgG1 antibodies as well as IL-4 and IFN-gamma cytokines </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Our findings indicate that 2-phenylpropenal is a very potent immunogen, supporting its possible involvement in the FBM-induced <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0235378,C0348754" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome;Injury or Poisoning" abbrv="">hepatotoxicity</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
