<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since she had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> and a bone marrow aspirate indicated hypocellularity with no increase in myeloblasts, <z:mpath ids='MPATH_589'>dysplasia</z:mpath> or abnormal chromosomes, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) was diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Pulse therapy with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi> and antibiotics proved successful, and blood cell numbers stabilized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In June 2001, she was readmitted to our hospital with persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0011134'>low grade fever</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001882'>leukopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A bone marrow aspirate from the sternum and iliac bone biopsy revealed compact proliferation of small lymphocytes, and the surface marker CD5- CD10- CD11c+ CD19+ CD20+ CD23- was detected through immune staining and flowcytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CD30+, CD34+and CD56+cells were scarce </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Tests for surface immunoglobulins, IgG, IgA, IgM and IgD, were negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No nodal or extranodal lesions were evident </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Since Southern blot analysis of bone marrow cells indicated rearrangement of the immunoglobulin heavy chain and abnormal chromosomes were evident, small lymphocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SLL</z:e>) was diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Four intravenous infusions of rituximab (375mg/m2) were administered without critical adverse effects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Tests conducted four weeks later revealed saturation of CD20+ antigens of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> cells and chromosomal abnormalities and rearrangement of the immunoglobulin heavy chain were still apparent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Though complete remission of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> was not achieved, serum concentrations of <z:chebi fb="4" ids="24996">lactate</z:chebi> dehydrogenase and soluble interleukin-2 receptor decreased, and the numbers of platelets and erythrocytes increased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was also an improvement in systemic condition </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>This was a rare case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">SLL</z:e> having the surface marker of CD5- CD10- CD11c+ CD19+ CD20+ CD23-, which had evolved from AA and infiltrated bone marrow </plain></SENT>
