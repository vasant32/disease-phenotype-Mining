<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Pretransplant blood transfusions from a dog leukocyte antigen (DLA)-identical canine littermate marrow donor will sensitize the recipient to non-DLA-linked polymorphic minor histocompatibility antigens, which uniformly results in graft rejection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We observed previously that 2000 cGy gamma-irradiation of marrow donor blood transfusions prevented this sensitization and subsequent marrow graft rejection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The purpose of the present study was to determine whether treatment of unrelated blood transfusions with gamma-irradiation would also prevent sensitization </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Conceivably, sensitization to minor histocompatibility antigens might be more efficient or potent and thus more difficult to prevent when those antigens are seen in the context of disparity for DLA antigens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, this model, in which sensitization to DLA-identical littermate marrow is caused by unrelated blood transfusions, is directly relevant to the clinical circumstances of human marrow transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We assessed sensitization caused by unrelated blood transfusions by monitoring graft outcome in recipients transplanted with DLA-identical littermate marrow after conditioning with 920 cGy total body irradiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two thousand cGy gamma-irradiation of unrelated blood transfusions significantly reduced the incidence of transfusion-induced sensitization of recipients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There was successful marrow engraftment in 15 of 16 (94%, P &lt; 0.003) of these animals in contrast to the previous study in which only 7 of 16 (44%) animals engrafted after they were transfused with unmodified blood on the same schedule </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that blood transfusions for use in humans, especially for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, should be gamma-irradiated in order to reduce the incidence of marrow graft rejection caused by sensitization to minor histocompatibility antigens </plain></SENT>
