<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Telomere shortening, in the course of somatic cell replication, ultimately leads to replicative senescence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In humans, rare mutations in genes that regulate telomere length have been identified in monogenic diseases such as <z:mp ids='MP_0009563'>dyskeratosis</z:mp> congenita and idiopathic <z:hpo ids='HP_0002206'>pulmonary fibrosis</z:hpo>, which are associated with shortened leukocyte telomere length (LTL) and increased risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Shortened LTL is observed in a host of aging-related complex <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019247" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">genetic diseases</z:e> and is associated with diminished survival in the elderly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We report results of a genome-wide association study of LTL in a consortium of four observational studies (n = 3,417 participants with LTL and genome-wide genotyping) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>SNPs in the regions of the oligonucleotide/<z:chebi fb="2" ids="50699">oligosaccharide</z:chebi>-binding folds containing one gene (OBFC1; rs4387287; P = 3.9 x 10(-9)) and chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 4 gene (CXCR4; rs4452212; P = 2.9 x 10(-8)) were associated with LTL at a genome-wide significance level (P &lt; 5 x 10(-8)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We attempted replication of the top SNPs at these loci through de novo genotyping of 1,893 additional individuals and in silico lookup in another observational study (n = 2,876), and we confirmed the association findings for OBFC1 but not CXCR4 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In addition, we confirmed the telomerase <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> component (TERC) as a gene associated with LTL (P = 1.1 x 10(-5)) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The identification of OBFC1 through genome-wide association as a locus for interindividual variation in LTL in the general population advances the understanding of telomere biology in humans and may provide insights into aging-related disorders linked to altered LTL dynamics </plain></SENT>
