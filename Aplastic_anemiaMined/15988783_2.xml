<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To elucidate its role in the disease, we have investigated levels of IL-8 by quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in bone marrow and peripheral blood plasma of 27 AA patients and in the marrow of 16 controls and blood of 20 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Significantly increased levels of IL-8 were observed in the marrow and blood of patients as compared to controls (470.4 +/- 549.6 vs. 37.5 +/- 30.3; P &lt; 0.0001) and (247.3 +/- 286.3 vs. 7.9 +/- 5.5; P &lt; 0.0001), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among the patients, the IL-8 levels were higher in patients with severe AA than those with nonsevere AA in the marrow (568.8 +/- 586.9 vs. 126.3 +/- 102.5; P &lt; 0.005) as well as in the blood (296.6 +/- 305.5 vs. 75.0 +/- 84.4; P &lt; 0.008) plasma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The marrow and blood of 74% (20/27) of the patients had increased levels of IL-8 compared to 12% (2/16; P &lt; 0.001) and 10% (2/20, P &lt; 0.001) of the controls, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that IL-8 may have an important role in the pathogenesis of AA </plain></SENT>
