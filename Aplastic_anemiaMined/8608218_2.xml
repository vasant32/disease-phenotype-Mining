<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Endogenous plasma granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) concentrations were serially measured in 68 patients with acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>A very sensitive chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLEIA) was used to measure the plasma G-CSF concentration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The minimum detection limit of this assay (0.5 pg/mL) was sufficient for the determination of G-CSF concentrations in patients and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The plasma G-CSF concentrations were significantly higher in 51 AA patients without signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> as compared with healthy control subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In AA patients with signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, the G-CSF concentrations appeared to increase during the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> phase </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>There was a significant negative correlation between plasma G-CSF concentrations and absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) in AA patients without signs of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although a decrease in the plasma G-CSF concentration was observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients who achieved self-sustaining hematopoiesis following bone marrow transplantation (BMT) or immunosuppressive (IS) therapy, it was lower in patients undergoing BMT as compared with those receiving IS therapy for any given degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001875'>neutropenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Plasma G-CSF concentrations were higher in patients responding to IS therapy than in nonresponders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This study demonstrated the negative feedback regulation of G-CSF that plasma G-CSF concentrations may be useful in predicting the clinical response to IS therapy </plain></SENT>
