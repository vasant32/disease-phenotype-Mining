<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We investigated the mechanisms responsible for TNF-alpha secretion from monocytic cells induced by the auto-antibodies that are purified from the sera of AA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>TNF-alpha induction by anti-moesin antibodies depended on the amount of cell surface moesin expressed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46941">THP</z:chebi>-1 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>F(ab')(2) fragments prepared from the anti-moesin antibodies were able to stimulate <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46941">THP</z:chebi>-1 cells to secrete TNF-alpha and this stimulatory effect was enhanced by cross-linking of moesins with anti-human IgG F(ab')(2) fragment antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Anti-moesin antibodies as well as their F(ab')(2) fragments induced the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in monocytic cells and this effect was suppressed by the addition of an ERK1/2 inhibitor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, anti-moesin antibody treatment induced the phosphorylation of moesin proteins in the monocytes and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46941">THP</z:chebi>-1 cells within 30 min </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These results indicate that anti-moesin antibodies induce TNF-alpha secretion from monocytes through the activation of the ERK1/2 pathway provoked by direct binding to moesin on the cells </plain></SENT>
