<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Concentrations of IL-4, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha in PHA-P-induced BMMNC supernatants were determined by ELISA assay in 11 SAA and 13 CAA patients as well as 16 controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Concentration differences between the two groups were compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: (1) The IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha levels in AA patients studied were much higher than that in controls, and IL-4 levels were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in SAA group but elevated in CAA group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>(2) TNF-alpha levels were comparable between the two AA groups, but both IL-4 and IFN-gamma levels were significantly different between them </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Enhanced cellular immunity seems to play an important role in the pathogenesis of SAA, and enhancement of both cellular and humoral immunity might contribute to the pathogenesis of CAA </plain></SENT>
