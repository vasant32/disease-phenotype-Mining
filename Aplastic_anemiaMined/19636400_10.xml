<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It has been over one hundred years since the first reported case of <z:mp ids='MP_0009563'>dyskeratosis</z:mp> congenita (DC) and over twenty since the discovery of telomerase, an enzyme that adds telomeric DNA repeats to chromosome ends </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Emerging evidence suggests that telomere dysfunction plays an important role in the pathogenesis of DC and other human disorders involving tissues that require rapid repair and renewal capacities </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Yet we still do not fully understand how mutations in telomere maintenance genes contribute to disease development in affected individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this review, we provide an up-to-date summary of the topic by discussing the results from genetic screens of patients, in vitro mutational analysis of involved molecules, and genetically engineered mouse models </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>While these data shed important light on the mechanisms underlying disease development, further investigation, particularly in an in vivo setting, is needed </plain></SENT>
