<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>To determine whether metabolic differences arising from differences in route of exposure or strain of mouse directed the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, the pharmacokinetics of <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> were compared between the two strains and between the two routes of administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Regardless of the route of exposure or the strain of mouse, seven major metabolites plus unmetabolized <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> were detected in most samples at most time points </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that the genetic modification in the Tg.AC mouse, i.e., insertion of the v-Ha-ras construct into the genome, did not disrupt any major pathways involved in determining the pharmacokinetics of <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Two significant differences were observed between the two routes of exposure: first, <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> was absorbed more slowly after intradermal injection than after oral gavage, and second, the intradermally dosed mice produced more conjugates of <z:chebi fb="1" ids="17594">hydroquinone</z:chebi> than did the orally dosed mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>These differences in metabolism may be involved in the previously observed differences in hematotoxicity between the two routes of exposure </plain></SENT>
