<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We have determined the influence of such debate on the utilization of ophthalmic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17698">chloramphenicol</z:chebi> in Bahrain, through studying the utilization patterns of ophthalmic antimicrobial preparations by the Ministry of Health, with an emphasis on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17698">chloramphenicol</z:chebi>, between 1993 and 2000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Cost-implications of these patterns are examined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIAL AND METHODS: Information on the annual purchase of ophthalmic <z:chebi fb="1" ids="36043">antimicrobial drug</z:chebi> preparations and their unit price was obtained from the Directorate of Materials Management, Ministry of Health, and analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In 1993, the 3 most commonly purchased ophthalmic antibacterial preparations were oxytetracycline 1% eye ointment (40.1%); sulfacetamide 10% and 20% eye drops (25.3%); and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17698">chloramphenicol</z:chebi> 0.5% eye drops and 1% eye ointment (10.8%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In 2000, oxytetracycline remained the most frequently purchased preparation (33%), followed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17698">chloramphenicol</z:chebi> (21.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Between 1993 and 1999, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17698">chloramphenicol</z:chebi> purchases fluctuated between 10% to 16.4% with a remarkable increase to 21.2%, in 2000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="17698">Chloramphenicol</z:chebi> accounted for 8.6% and 15.1% of cost of total ophthalmic preparations purchased in 1993 and 2000, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Despite continued concerns of potential risks of ophthalmic <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17698">chloramphenicol</z:chebi>, this preparation is extensively utilized in Bahrain </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>We are of the opinion that for minor <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e>, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17698">chloramphenicol</z:chebi> ophthalmic preparations should be replaced by safer alternatives </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Further, we recommend that their use be reserved for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0015403" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">ocular infections</z:e> that are resistant to other antimicrobials, and that ophthalmologists, at the secondary care level, should supervise such treatment </plain></SENT>
