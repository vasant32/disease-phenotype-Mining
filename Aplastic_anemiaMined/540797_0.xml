<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Preliminary data indicates that this test may be more sensitive than the <z:chebi fb="74" ids="28073">chromium</z:chebi> release assay and should be added to a battery of prospective in vitro tests designed to detect those patients at risk for marrow graft rejection </plain></SENT>
