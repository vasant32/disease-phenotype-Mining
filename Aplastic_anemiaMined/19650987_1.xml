<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, only 30% of patients have HLA-identical siblings to serve as donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This study investigated the feasibility of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from HLA mismatched related donors for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002875" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">beta-thalassemia major</z:e> in children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Between November 2001 and November 2007, 10 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002875" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">beta-thalassemia major</z:e> at median ages of 4.4 years (range:1.6-9.4 years) received 11 transplantations from their haploidentical donors, either HLA mismatched sibling umbilical cord bloods (n=6) or parents marrows (n=4) or sibling marrow (n=1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The conditioning regiment included fludarabine (100 mg/m2), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi> (16 mg/kg), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (200 mg/kg) and antithymocyte globulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: Of the 10 patients, 6 (60%) had sustained engraftment and red blood cell transfusion independence; 2 patients showed transient engraftment but rejected the graft quickly; 1 patients had no evidence of engraftment and developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>; 1 patient who received two transplantations had no evidence of engraftment and developed persistent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> eight engrafted patients showed grade I to III <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD), and only one developed limited skin <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The probability of overall and disease-free survival was 90% and 60%, respectively, with a median follow-up duration of 57.1 months (range: 2.5 to 85.1 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Haploidentical stem cell transplantation is an alternative option for children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002875" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">beta-thalassemia major</z:e>, particularly when a matched sibling donor is not available </plain></SENT>
