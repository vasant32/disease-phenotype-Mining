<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PLACE AND DURATION OF THE STUDY: Pediatric Units of Children Hospital, Islamabad, from January 1999 to December 2003 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> children, clinically suspected to have <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi>, who underwent bone marrow examination, were included After reviewing the file records of these patients for history, examination and investigations, a predesigned proforma was filled and data was analyzed, using SPSS version 10 for statistical analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results were reported in the form of frequencies, percentages and mean </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A majority of the children were between 48 to 96 months, with a mean age of 54.43 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Male to female ratio was 1.45:1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Mean platelet count was 33861/mm(3) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>None of the bone marrow results showed the presence of abnormal cells consistent with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0848852,C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematological malignancy</z:e> </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> in one patient was hypoplastic, and subsequently, he was diagnosed to have <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> on trephine biopsy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Bone marrow <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> should not be a part of routine work-up for diagnosing <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> in children and should be reserved for those children having atypical clinical and laboratory features </plain></SENT>
