<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Since alemtuzumab (ALM) is a monoclonal anti-CD52 antibody that targets both cell types, we assessed the effects of treatment with ALM and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> (CS) on 19 patients with BMFS (median age 48 years; range, 16-74 years), including 14 with severe/very severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA), 3 with transfusion-dependent AA and 1 each with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and pure red cell <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> (PRCA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The dose of ALM was escalated from dose cohort I (10mg on day 1, 20mg on day 2, and 30 mg on day 3) to dose cohort II (30 mg/d for 3 days) plus CS for at least 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thirteen patients were in dose cohort I and 6 were in dose cohort II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Five patients (23.5%) had a complete response (CR), 2 (11.8%) had a partial response (PR), and 12 (64.7%) had no response, making the overall response rate 36.8% (7/19) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The overall response rates in dose cohorts I and II were 46.2% (6/13) and 16.7% (1/6), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Among the 17 patients with AA, the ORR was 35.3% (6/17), 50.0% (6/12) in dose cohort 1 and 0 (0/5) in dose cohort II </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Most responsive patients responded within 3 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Among responders, median time to initial response was 2.07 months (95% CI, 1.40-2.75 months) and median time from initial response to complete response in complete responders was 9.33 months (95% CI, 0.0-31.71 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The 2-year survival rate was 81.6% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These findings indicate that ALM-CS should be one option for IST in BMFS, and that 60 mg of ALM may be sufficient compared with the higher dose (90 mg) </plain></SENT>
