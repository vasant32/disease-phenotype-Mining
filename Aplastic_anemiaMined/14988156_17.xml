<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Clinical features and liver histology suggest a central role for an immune-mediated mechanism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To characterize the immune response, we investigated the T-cell repertoire (T-cell receptor [TCR] V(beta) chain subfamily) of intrahepatic lymphocytes in HAA patients by TCR spectratyping </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In 6 of 7 HAA liver samples, a broad skewing pattern in the 21 V(beta) subfamilies tested was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In total, 62% +/- 18% of HAA spectratypes showed a skewed pattern, similar to 68% +/- 18% skewed spectratype patterns in 3 of 4 patients with confirmed <z:hpo ids='HP_0006562'>viral hepatitis</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Additionally, the T-cell repertoire had similarly low levels of complexity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In the peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) of a separate group of HAA patients prior to treatment, 60% +/- 15% skewed spectratypes were detected, compared with only 18% +/- 8% skewed spectratypes in healthy controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After successful immunosuppressive treatment, an apparent reversion to a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> T-cell repertoire with a corresponding significant increase in T-cell repertoire complexity was observed in the HAA samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, our data suggest an antigen-driven T-cell expansion in HAA and achievement of a <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> T-cell repertoire during recovery from HAA </plain></SENT>
