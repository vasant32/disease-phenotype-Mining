<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>During the first 8 weeks, we administered only G-CSF, but subsequently we administered EPO with G-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Administration of G-CSF caused rapid increase in neutrophil counts in each case </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the first case, a 23-year-old woman, the first sign of improvement of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> appeared in the 12th week but 50 more weeks elapsed before improvement of platelet count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the second case, a 59-year-old woman, marked increase of reticulocytes appeared in the 32nd week, and the RBC count become <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in the 46th week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Minor improvement of platelet count was obtained in the 40th week </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>After 53 weeks of treatment, we stopped administration of G-CSF and EPO, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of peripheral blood cell counts decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Therefore G-CSF and EPO were given to her again, and she showed the same response as first administration </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It showed that she was dependent upon G-CSF and EPO </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Finally she obtained normalization of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> blood cell counts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>In both cases, no serious side effects were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Combination therapy consisting of G-CSF and EPO may be beneficial for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
