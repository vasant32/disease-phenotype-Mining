<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Nine patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> were studied using the soft agar marrow culture assay (CFU-c) to identify granulocyte-monocyte progenitor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients' marrows were then cocultured with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> marrow to identify suppressor cells that inhibit <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colony formation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three of nine patients had low colony formation and no suppression in coculture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>These patients may have a defect intrinsic to the marrow granulocyte-monocyte progenitor cell, termed type I </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three of nine patients had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> colony formation and no suppression in coculture, possibly representing a type II defect in the hemopoietic environment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Three of nine patients had low colony formation in the CFU-c assay and their marrow contained cells that suppressed colony formation by <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> marrow in coculture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>This defect, termed type III, may result from suppressor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo> may be a syndrome resulting from at least three different pathogenetic mechanisms involving defects in (1) stem cells, (2) the marrow environment or (3) suppressor cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This may represent one end of the spectrum of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> with diminished cellularity (<z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>) or <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cellularity (<z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo>) resulting from similar mechanisms </plain></SENT>
