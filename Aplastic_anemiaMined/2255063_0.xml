<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The first case was a 25-year-old woman with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The transplantation was both major and minor mismatch, where the donor was type A and the recipient was type B </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After the administrations of haptoglobin 8,000 units we transfused bone marrow infusates from which incompatible erythrocytes were removed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Though prominent <z:mp ids='MP_0000332'>hemoglobinemia</z:mp> was observed in both cases, the serum haptoglobin values were not saturated and <z:hpo ids='HP_0003641'>hemoglobinuria</z:hpo> was not detectable </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Intravenous haptoglobin supplement therapy makes transplantation safer and may contribute to improve the recovery rate of total nucleated bone marrow cells after the erythrocyte <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> without worrying much about their contamination </plain></SENT>
