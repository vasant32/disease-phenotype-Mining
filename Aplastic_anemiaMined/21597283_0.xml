<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The clinical and biological spectrum of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004818'>paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>) is variable, ranging from classical hemolytic forms to <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> or other bone marrow (BM) failure syndromes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We report a previously undescribed case of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> occurring after autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) in a patient affected by relapsing non-Hodgkin's <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphoma</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The intensive chemotherapy and the ASCT resulted in a contraction of the effective hematopoietic stem cell (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSC</z:chebi>) pool and a derangement of the immune system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The delayed engraftment and the BM <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> represented a favorable environment for the expansion of the pathological clone </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This case is paradigmatic even for the unexpected trend of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> clone during treatment with the terminal complement inhibitor eculizumab; in fact, the clone reduced until undergoing unexpected extinction, i.e. the recovery of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> hematopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eculizumab seems not to play a direct role in <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSC</z:chebi> kinetics; the clinical remission probably occurred because the environmental conditions that led to the expansion of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> clone were transient and disappeared </plain></SENT>
