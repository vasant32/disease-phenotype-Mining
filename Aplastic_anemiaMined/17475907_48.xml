<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In younger patients, the 5-year probabilities of overall survival were 73% and 85% after PBPC and BM transplantations, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Corresponding probabilities for older patients were 52% and 64% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that BM grafts are preferred to PBPC grafts in young patients undergoing HLA-matched sibling donor transplantation for SAA </plain></SENT>
