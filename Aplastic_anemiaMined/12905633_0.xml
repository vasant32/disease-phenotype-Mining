<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The study was performed on lethal rat <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> model induced by combined <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> (5-FU) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The rh-BMP-2 was implanted into the thigh muscle of the rats at 3 days before <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> was induced </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the control group the rats were implanted with agar into the thigh muscle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The blood picture, pathologic changes and the mortality in two groups were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>At the same time, rh-BMP-2 were implanted into the thigh muscle of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> Kun-min mice for dynamic control observation of the implantation local morphological changes, colony forming units-spleen (CFU-S) and stem cell growth factor (SCF) expression of the stroma cells of ectopic ossicles induced by BMP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At 7 days after BMP implantation in the mice the mesenchymal cells around BMP in muscle proliferated, and appeared in bone marrow to form an ectopic ossicles </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The SCF expression of stroma cells in ectopic ossicles were higher than that of self-bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>56.3% of BMP-treated aplastic rats were survived over 3 months and its hematopoiesis was completely reconstituted and the histo-morphological picture of the spleen and bone marrow were recovered to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>But in the control group only one of 23 rats was survived, the remainder died of hematopoietic failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: BMP-implantation into the skeletal muscle could rescue the bone marrow hematopoietic failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The mechanism might be related to the BMP activated auto-mesenchymal cells of skeletal muscles to direct hematopoietic cell differentiation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In our hands it might create a new pathway for utilization of auto-muscle derived mesenchymal cells to reconstitute hematopoiesis </plain></SENT>
