<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Protective immunity against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025007" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">measles</z:e> has been studied but is still not completely understood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, five cases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025007" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">measles</z:e> were encountered in immunocompromised children </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Two of these were allogeneic bone marrow transplanted cases (one common variable <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> and one severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>) in remission, one <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027708" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Wilms' tumor</z:e> case in remission, one <z:hpo ids='HP_0002884'>hepatoblastoma</z:hpo> case after cytotoxic therapy at disease <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> and one exaggerating <z:mpath ids='MPATH_654'>hemophagocytic syndrome</z:mpath> case with suppressed natural killer cell activity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Clinical symptoms, laboratory findings and the immunologic backgrounds of these five patients were investigated </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One of the patients, an 8 year old boy with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_654'>hemophagocytic syndrome</z:mpath>, died of giant cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> which was confirmed in the section of necropsy lung specimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two other patients who received allogeneic bone marrow transplants were not immune to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025007" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">measles</z:e>, despite their own and their donors' immunizations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Their clinical symptoms were rather severe but both patients recovered and have remained seropositive for as long as 13 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This fatality from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025007" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">measles</z:e> is the first reported in a patient with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_654'>hemophagocytic syndrome</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Suppressed natural killer cell activity may be a poor prognostic factor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Also, secondary immunization failure for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025007" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">measles</z:e> can occur in bone marrow transplanted patients with rather severe clinical symptoms </plain></SENT>
