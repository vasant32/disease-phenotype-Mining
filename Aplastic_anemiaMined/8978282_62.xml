<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although the kidney, liver, bone marrow (BM), and spleen have been identified as the major sources of TPO production, the precise cellular location of TPO <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression in these tissues remains unknown </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have identified the cells expressing TPO <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in the human kidney, liver, and BM using an in situ hybridization assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the BM of individuals with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> platelet counts, the hybridization signal was too weak to allow identification of the TPO <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expressing cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, in thrombocytopenic subjects with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, postchemotherapy marrow <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001973'>immune thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, the stromal cells showed strong TPO <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In the human subjects with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> platelet counts, the cells of the proximal convoluted tubules of the kidney showed consistent positive staining whereas the signal in the cells of the distal convoluted tubules was less consistent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Strong hybridization signal was also evident in the hepatocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The hybridization signal in the spleen, even in thrombocytopenic subjects, was too weak to allow confident identification of the cells expressing TPO <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> subjects, the interstitial cells and endothelial cells of the liver and spleen, the renal peritubular cells, and the hematopoietic precursor cells of the BM showed no TPO <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that TPO <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression in the human BM may be modulated by platelet mass </plain></SENT>
