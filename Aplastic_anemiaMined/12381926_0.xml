<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Scientific analyses fortified by interpretations of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002721'>immunodeficiency</z:hpo> diseases as 'experiments of nature' have revealed the specific immune systems to be comprised of T cells subserving cell-mediated immunities plus B cells and plasma cells which produce and secrete antibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These two separate cellular systems regularly interact with each other to produce a coordinated defense which permits mammals to live within a sea of microorganisms that threaten the integrity and the survival of individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have shown that bone marrow transplantation (BMT) can be used as a form of cellular engineering to construct or reconstruct the immune systems and cure otherwise fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0004430'>severe combined immunodeficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>When severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> complicated the first BMT which was performed to cure a fatal <z:hpo ids='HP_0004430'>severe combined immunodeficiency</z:hpo>, a second BMT cured for the first time a complicating severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, BMT has been used effectively to treat some 75 otherwise fatal diseases such as resistant <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002665'>lymphomas</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0025521" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">inborn errors of metabolism</z:e>, and genetic anomalies of the hematopoietic development such as sickle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039730" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thalassemia</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0005549'>congenital neutropenias</z:hpo>, and many other diseases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>More recently, we have employed BMT in mice both to cure and cause <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunities</z:hpo>, and, together, these experiments showed that <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunities</z:hpo> actually reside in the hematopoietic stem cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We have also found that mixed BMT or mixed hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) can be used to prevent and cure the most complex <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunities</z:hpo> such as those occurring in BXSB mice and in (NZW x BXSB)F1 W/BF1 mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Untreated, the former develop fulminating lethal <z:hpo ids='HP_0000099'>glomerulonephritis</z:hpo> plus numerous humoral <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmunities</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mice of the (W/B)F1 strain develop autoimmune thrombocytopenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000979'>purpura</z:hpo>, coronary <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0042373" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">vascular disease</z:e> with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001658'>myocardial infarction</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000099'>glomerulonephritis</z:hpo>, and numerous autoantibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of these abnormalities are prevented or cured by mixed syngeneic (autoimmune) plus allogeneic (<z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> healthy) BMT or mixed peripheral blood HSCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, the most complex <z:hpo ids='HP_0002960'>autoimmune diseases</z:hpo> can be prevented or cured in experimental animals by mixed syngeneic plus allogeneic BMT or HSCT which produce stable mixed chimerism as a form of cellular engineering </plain></SENT>
