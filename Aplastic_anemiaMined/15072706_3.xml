<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We present a case of a 53-year-old Japanese female who had been treated with 30 mg/d of MMI for 30 days for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018213" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">Graves' disease</z:e> and was subsequently admitted to the Japan Self Defense Forces (JSDF) Central Hospital with a mild sore throat and high-grade <z:hpo ids='HP_0001945'>fever</z:hpo> that began the previous day </plain></SENT>
