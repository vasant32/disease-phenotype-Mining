<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A rapid and inexpensive method is described for the enrichment of fetal <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (HbF) which eliminates the interference of other <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobins</z:chebi> in the HPLC analysis of gamma chains when HbF is less than or equal to 20-30% of the total Hb </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The enrichment procedure, which is carried out on 1 ml hemolysate, is based on the alkaline denaturation of the other Hbs followed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29105">Zn2+</z:chebi> precipitation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Samples are injected into the HPLC apparatus without further treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The method was validated by HPLC analysis of hemolysates with high levels of HbF and mixtures prepared by diluting the high HbF hemolysates with adult hemolysates </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The relative proportions of gamma chains as well as their chromatographic behavior were unaltered by the HbF enrichment procedure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The method is illustrated by the analysis of hemolysates of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> newborns and of patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0039730" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thalassemia</z:e>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0002895" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">sickle cell diseases</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> containing 3.4 to 100% HbF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>For the four hemolysates containing greater than 20% HbF, the same quantitative and chromatographic results were obtained by direct analysis and after enrichment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although reproducible and accurate results were obtained for the enrichment method and HPLC analysis when HbF was greater than or equal to 3%, at lower concentrations the variability of both was unacceptably high, indicating the need for additional or improved methodology for hemolysates containing very low levels of HbF </plain></SENT>
