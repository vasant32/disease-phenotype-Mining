<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>This study was aimed to investigate the expressions of multiple cytokines on bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>), and its significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) was used to detect the expressions of IL-1β, SCF, G-CSF at <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> level in bone marrow MSC of patients with AA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) technique was used to detect the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> expression of TPO in bone marrow MSC of AA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results indicated that the expression of SCF in AA group was much lower than that in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control group (p &lt; 0.05), and the expression of TPO in AA group was higher than that in the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control group (p &lt; 0.05), while the expression of IL-1β of AA had no significant difference when compared with the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control group (p &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control group, the expressions of SCF of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients was lower (p &lt; 0.05), but the expressions of IL-1β and TPO did not show significant difference (p &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The expressions of IL-1β, SCF and TPO were no significant difference between AA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> groups (p &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Neither the AA patients, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients nor the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control group had the expression of G-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the expression of SCF and TPO in bone marrow MSC of AA patients are obviously abnormal, the expression of SCF is also abnormal in bone marrow MSC of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
