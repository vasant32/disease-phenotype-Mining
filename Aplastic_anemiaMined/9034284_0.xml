<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>To establish a simple computer program for the laboratory diagnosis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> and related diseases, multivariate analyses were applied to the results of routine hematological laboratory tests obtained from 48 patients and 51 healthy volunteers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patients studied were limited to those who had not been treated hematologically by the time of their first visit to our hospital, and their first data obtained in our laboratory were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Final diagnoses were <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) in 21, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) in 14, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001891'>iron deficiency anemia</z:hpo> (IDA) in 3, polycytemia vera (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PV</z:e>)in 3, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001973'>idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi>) in 7 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eight parameters, WBC, RBC, Hb, Ht, MCV, MCH, MCHC, and PLT, were transformed to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> distribution and then applied to principal component analysis to evaluate their independence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Very close relationships were observed between Ht and Hb, and between MCV and MCH </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>One each of these pairs was selected by discriminant analysis and two sets, RBC, MCH, Hb, PLT, and WBC, and RBC, MCV, Ht, PLT, and WBC, were obtained </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Two canonical components gave good discrimination of these five diseases and also of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>When disease prediction was made using this analysis, 37 of 48 patients (77.1%) were predicted correctly, and furthermore, when two disease predictions were allowed, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were diagnosed properly </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Some overlaps were observed in this two-dimensional coordinate system, especially of AA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, and also with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>To improve the system further, the additional parameters of age and sex were added to construct a three-dimensional analysis which resulted in much clearer discrimination </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The whole procedure described is being developed with subjects who are not taking medication </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Subsequently, the general application of this analytical procedure should be limited to only those not on medications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, this is in essence a demonstration project; however, this trial of laboratory diagnosis using routine hematological laboratory results appears to be promising </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Further extension of the study by increasing numbers of patients and disorders studied, including secondary <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemias</z:hpo>, will allow the design of diagnostic software for use with personal computers at the sites of primary care </plain></SENT>
