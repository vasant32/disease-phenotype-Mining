<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the current study, BJBDT was demonstrated to regulate hematopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>BJBDT significantly increased the expression of hematopoietic cytokines interleukin (IL)-3, stem cell factor (SCF), granulocyte-macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), thrombopoietin (TPO) and erythropoietin (EPO) at the level of <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and secretion in hematopoietic stem cells (<z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSCs</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Additionally, BJBDT enhanced the phosphorylation of Janus activated kinase 2 (JAK2) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) and STAT binding to gamma interferon activated sites (GAS) in <z:chebi fb="15" ids="50443">HSCs</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, BJBDT significantly enhanced the growth rate of granulocyte erythrocyte monocyte macrophage colony-forming units (CFU-GEMM) and erythroid burst forming units (BFU-E) in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Moreover, BJBDT increased the level of EPO at <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> in kidney and plasma, and the numbers of erythroid-specific antigen Ter-119(+) erythroid cells in mice with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> induced by 20% <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Consistently, histochemical staining revealed BJBDT increased the bone marrow and stromal cells as well as decreased macrophages and adipocytes in bone marrow tissues of mice with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Taken together, the results suggest that BJBDT can enhance hematopoiesis via hematopoietic cytokine-mediated JAK2/STAT5 pathway as a potent hematopoietic candidate </plain></SENT>
