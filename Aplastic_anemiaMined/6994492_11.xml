<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Among the 401 members responding, 50 had treated AA patients, and three remissions were reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>These remissions can be explained either by response to CYT in a subgroup of patients with AA due to an immune mechanism or to spontaneous remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Clinical trials of the efficacy of cytotoxic drugs in the treatment of AA patients will not likely permit a distinction between drug effect and spontaneous remission until the subgroup of patients with immune-mediated AA is identified through the development of more sensitive and specific in vitro tests </plain></SENT>
