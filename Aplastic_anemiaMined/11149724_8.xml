<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Recently, some investigators have suggested that immunosuppressive therapy may replace bone marrow transplantation as first-line therapy for this disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>To assess its validity, we compared the outcomes of bone marrow transplantation vs immunosuppressive therapy in one institution from 1987 to 1997 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We studied 46 consecutive patients less than 18 years of age who presented between January 1987 and April 1997 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Inherited marrow failure syndromes and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> were excluded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Patients received immunosuppressive therapy vs bone marrow transplantation based on availability of HLA-matched donors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The main outcome measures were survival, complete marrow and hematological remission, or partial remission but achieving independence from transfusional support </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty patients received multi-agent immunosuppressive therapy (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi>, antithymocyte globulin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi>); 11 attained complete remission and three partial remission for a transfusion-independent survival of 70% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Six patients died of infectious and hemorrhagic complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Twenty-six patients were transplanted and 24 (93%) achieved complete remission; one achieved a PR, 25 remain transfusion independent with a median follow-up of 5.9 years or 70 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>One patient developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> 34 months after successful transplant and one patient died due to graft failure and complications of transplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>There has been a striking improvement in survival for pediatric patients treated with multi-agent immunosuppression in the last decade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>However, transplantation results have also improved and this remains the definitive first-line therapy for severe acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> in this age group </plain></SENT>
