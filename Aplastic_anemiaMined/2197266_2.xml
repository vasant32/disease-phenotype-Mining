<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> eight patients demonstrated a continuous rise in the absolute number of neutrophils, eosinophils, and monocytes over the first four weeks of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow examination revealed a progressive increase in bone marrow cellularity in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients except one </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>An increase in myeloid: erythroid ratio was seen with progressive maturation of granulocytic cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Neutrophilic and eosinophilic myelocytes were the most prominent cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The percentage of myeloblasts and promyelocytes did not increase significantly, and the proportions of postmitotic granulocytic cells did not change either </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant morphologic changes were noted in the basophilic, erythroid, and megakaryocytic series </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The most prominent topographic observation in the bone marrow during GM-CSF therapy was the frequent clustering of myeloid cells close to the bone trabeculae </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The periosteal localization of myeloid precursors may reflect a higher concentration of stem cells and/or stromal cells in the bone marrow adjacent to the bone trabeculae or a higher concentration of growth factors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Careful morphologic examination of bone marrow in CSF clinical trials will provide useful information regarding the in vivo effects of these growth factors, and will aid in the development of a rational approach to combining them for therapy </plain></SENT>
