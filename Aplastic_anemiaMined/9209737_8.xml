<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Children with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (SAA) are treated with bone marrow transplantation (BMT) if a human leukocyte antigen (HLA) compatible sibling donor is available, or alternatively with immunosuppressive therapy (IST) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Three retrospective trials examining BMT vs IST in pediatric patients treated from 1970-1988 found BMT resulted in a superior survival rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Advances have been made in general supportive care and in the approach to each of these treatment modalities in the last decade </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To compare survival following BMT and IST in a more recent era, we retrospectively analyzed the results of 48 consecutively treated children with SAA presenting to Memorial Sloan-Kettering <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Cancer</z:e> Center (MSKCC) between 1983 and 1992 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In contrast to the previous studies, the estimated survival of the BMT and IST groups at 120 months are equivalent, 75.6% and 73.8%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The IST results in our series are superior to the 42-48% (2-10 year) survival previously published, but similar to survival data observed in more recent IST trials employing more intensive immunosuppression (antithymocyte globulin and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The overall BMT survival rates are similar to those previously published, although BMT results improved dramatically during the latter five years of this analysis, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> 11 patients transplanted surviving with a minimum follow-up of 3 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No surviving BMT patient has extensive <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GvHD), a major cause of long-term mortality post-BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Therefore, it is likely the BMT survival curve will remain stable </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In contrast, the survival curve of the IST patients is likely unstable, since patients are still at risk for relapse or development of clonal disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, despite overall similar survival rates, we continue to recommend BMT as first-line therapy in pediatric SAA patients with matched sibling donors </plain></SENT>
