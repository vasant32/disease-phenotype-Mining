<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHOD: 60 patients with CAA were randomly divided into two groups, 30 patients in the SFI group were treated with SFI (100 mL which contains Ginsenoside 0.8 mg x mL(-1) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="2430">aconitine</z:chebi> 1.8 microg x mL(-1) by adding it in 500 mL of 5% <z:chebi fb="105" ids="17234">glucose</z:chebi> every day) plus stanozol and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> and 30 patients in the control group treated with slanozol and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> alone for 2 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The clinical efficacy was observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The change of T-lymphocyte subset analyzed by flow cytometry and the levels of serum IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, IL-2 measured with ELISA method were also observed before and after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULT: After treatment, the total effective rate of the SFI group was higher than that in the control group, but it did not showing significant difference </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The CD4/CD8 levels were significantly increased (1.76+/-0.49, P&lt; 0.01) and CD8 levels were significantly lowered (22.57+/-6.30, P &lt; 0.01) in the SFI group after treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Serum levels of lFN-gamma, TNF-alpha and IL-2 were lower in both groups, and the level of TNF-alpha and IL-2 in the SFI group (0.710+/-0.213) ng x L(-1) and (0.639+/-0.247) ng x L(-1) was significantly lowered than that in the control group (P &lt; 0.05, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: SFI might believe the hemopoietic inhibition so as to promote the recovery of hemopoietic function through improving the T-lymphocyte subset and reducing the release of hemopoietic negative regulatory factors such as IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha and IL-2 </plain></SENT>
