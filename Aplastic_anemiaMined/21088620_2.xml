<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We carried out CBT in 5 children with relapsed or refractory severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, using immunosuppressive preparative regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The median time from the diagnosis to the CBT was 16 months (15 to 47 mo), with <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the children having failed at least 1 course of immunosuppressive therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The conditioning regimens consisted of fludarabine, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, and antithymocyte globulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One patient had an HLA-identical sibling donor, and 4 had unrelated donors selected from an NMDP-affiliated cord blood bank </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two patients received double-unit grafts to attain a target TNC dose of at least 3.0×10/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Donor/recipient HLA matching was 6 of 6 (n=2) and 5 of 6 (n=5) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The median nucleated cell dose infused was 5.6 (range, 3.6 to 6.1) ×10 cells/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The median infused CD34 dose was 2.9 (range, 1.8 to 7.5) ×10 cells/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> the patients achieved neutrophil engraftment at a median of 13 days (range, 11 to 25 d) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The median time to platelet engraftment was 48 days (range, 34 to 56 d) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>After CBT, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD developed in 4 cases, CMV reactivation in 1, <z:hpo ids='HP_0002090'>pneumonia</z:hpo> in 1, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> in 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Four patients successfully engrafted, but 1 failed to engraft and had delayed autologous recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>However, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients were now transfusion-independent at the time of reporting </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>This result suggests that CBT using optimal conditioning regimens can be a salvage treatment for patients without a suitable bone marrow donor and warrants further prospective studies </plain></SENT>
