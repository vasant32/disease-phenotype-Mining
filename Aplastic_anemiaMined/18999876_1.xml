<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In patients who developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> type syndrome, <z:mp ids='MP_0002020'>spontaneous tumor</z:mp> regression was observed and concomitantly high titers of serum autoantibodies were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In order to identify the antibody specificity, two-dimensional electrophoresis, blotting and immunoreactions were used to analyze the peripheral blood stem cell extract with autoantibodies containing serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The unique protein spot visualized exclusively by serum of patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> type syndrome was identified as carbonic anhydrase I (CA I, accession No </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>P00915 and Q7M316) by means of mass spectrometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The specificity of autoantibodies was confirmed by reaction with commercial CAs I, II, IX and XII </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Immunoreaction in Western blots with these CA isoforms differed in sera obtained from patients with various types of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Sera of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> patients reacted with CA I, II and XII; sera of <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> patients reacted with the CA I, II, XII and IX </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Patients developing and/or possessing CA autoantibodies had a significant survival benefit over those who did not develop CA anhydrase autoantibodies </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Possible relevance of the presence of CA autoantibodies and clinical outcome is discussed </plain></SENT>
