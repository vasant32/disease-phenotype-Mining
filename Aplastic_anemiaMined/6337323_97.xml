<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patients were selected for the present analysis according to the criterion of sustained marrow engraftment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Of the 130 patients, 97 are now alive between 1.4 and 11 years (median, 5) after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-nine of the thirty-three who died had either <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Our analysis was directed at identifying factors predicting GVHD and survival after transplantation in patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Our key findings were that moderately severe to severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD had a strong adverse influence on survival; that a protective environment significantly reduced mortality, which corresponded in part to a reduction in and delayed <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD; that refractoriness to random-donor platelet infusions at transplantation adversely influenced survival, particularly among patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD; and that increasing age was associated with increased mortality </plain></SENT>
