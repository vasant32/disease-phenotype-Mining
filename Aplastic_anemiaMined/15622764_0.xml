<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: HLA-DR+ T cells were detected in bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB) of 20 SAA patients and controls (9 for BM and 11 for PB) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>PHA-LYCM conditioned medium was prepared, and its in vitro effect on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow BFU-E and CFU-GM was studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The percentages of HLA-DR+ T lymphocytes in BM and PB of newly diagnosed SAA patients were significantly higher than that of controls (P&lt;0.001), and that of recovered SAA (rSAA) patients after ALG therapy (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Compared with controls, the <z:chebi fb="3" ids="53317">PBA</z:chebi>-LYCMs from newly diagnosed SAA patients showed significant inhibitory effect on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> BFU-E and CFU-GM (P&lt;0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The activated T lymphocyte may play an important role in the pathogenesis of SAA </plain></SENT>
