<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>IHA is defined as elevated plasma ammonia concentrations (&gt; 200 mumol/l) in the absence of significant liver function abnormality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>From a 21 year BMT database of 2358 patients, we have identified 12 patients (0.5%) with IHA, ages 19 to 46 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Diagnoses included ALL (n = 2), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (n = 4), CLL (n = 1), <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> (n = 3) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (n = 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Eight received marrow from a matched sibling donor, three from an unrelated donor and one autologous marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>IHA occurred between 14 and 106 days after transplant (median, 25 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Most frequently patients presented with symptoms of a metabolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001298'>encephalopathy</z:hpo>, with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001254'>lethargy</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001289'>confusion</z:hpo> evolving into unresponsiveness, metabolic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001259'>coma</z:hpo> and in eight cases, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001250'>seizures</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At diagnosis of IHA, liver functions were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> or only modestly abnormal </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Ten of the 12 patients died 1 to 9 days (median 3.5 days) after diagnosis of IHA despite treatment with combinations of dialysis and ammonia-trapping therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>While IHA is a rare complication of BMT, it is associated with a high mortality </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Early recognition of the syndrome by measurement of plasma ammonia concentrations in patients with neurological symptoms may improve outcome </plain></SENT>
