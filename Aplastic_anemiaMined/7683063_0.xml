<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>When peripheral CD8 positive cells obtained before therapy were cocultured with bone marrow CD34 positive cells obtained after hematological recovery, the number of colony forming unit granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM) and burst forming unit erythroid (BFU-E) were decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>This result indicates that ALG and CyA inhibits CD8 positive cells which suppress the growth of progenitor cells, resulting in the recovery of hematopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Next we investigated the plasma concentrations of cytokines including G-CSF, GM-CSF, IL-6, IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta after ALG treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Although the elevation of plasma concentrations of G-CSF and GM-CSF after ALG treatment were found in 11 of 13 patients and in 2 of 13 patients respectively, cytokine production by ALG appeared to be unrelated to the therapeutic effect of ALG for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
