<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Various immunosuppressive regimens have been recommended in the absence of an HLA-identical bone marrow donor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">Prednisolone</z:chebi>, antithymocyte globulin, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> have been shown to be effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This report describes the successful treatment of a 23-year-old woman suffering from severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> who had become multiresistant against previously administered <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressive agents</z:chebi>, using a monoclonal IL-2-receptor blocking antibody </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient responded within 4 weeks </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The time to the next relapse was 8 months; however, another remission with a second course of horse-antithymocyte globulin was achieved and has been maintained for 27 months to date with low doses of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Although this is an anecdotical report, IL-2-receptor blockade using a monoclonal antibody might be considered as a further alternative in multi-resistant SAA, perhaps increasing the susceptibility to further immunosuppressive trials </plain></SENT>
