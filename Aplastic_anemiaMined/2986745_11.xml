<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Inconsistent B, T, T4, and T8 cell functions in the marrow graft recipients provide evidence for (a) different functional groups of cells within each subset responsive to different polyclonal activators; (b) a spectrum of immune capabilities within each phenotype lineage; (c) different patterns of immune reconstitution for each lymphocyte subset after marrow grafting; and (d) <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD altering recovery of in vitro functional responses to the different polyclonal activators </plain></SENT>
