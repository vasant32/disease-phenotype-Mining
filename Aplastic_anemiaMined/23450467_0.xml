<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The final dose of alemtuzumab in these studies was 0.16 mg/kg/day for 6 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>At this dose, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of the 12 and 11 patients in the AA and MM studies, respectively, achieved initial engraftment and the incidences of Grade II-IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) were 0% and 18% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>While cytomegalovirus (CMV) frequently reactivated, none of the patients developed fatal CMV disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Transplantation-related mortality within 1 year after HSCT was observed in only two and one patients, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The numbers of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells and T-cell receptor rearrangement excision circles remained low within 1 year after HSCT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that the use of alemtuzumab at this dose in a conditioning regimen enables safe allogeneic HSCT even from a 2- or 3-antigen-mismatched donor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>However, the use of a lower dose of alemtuzumab should be explored in future studies to accelerate immune recovery after HSCT </plain></SENT>
