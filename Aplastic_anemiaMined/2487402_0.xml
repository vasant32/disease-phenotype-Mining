<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Immunosuppressive treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> has been increasingly used as an alternative treatment to bone marrow transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In this study, the additive effect of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">Cyclosporin A</z:chebi> (CSA) (5mg/kg/day, at least 3 months) for maintenance of immunosuppression after antilymphocyte globulin (ALG) therapy (40mg/kg/day for 4 days) was compared to the previous ALG alone treatment (15mg/kg/day for 10 days) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A high dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi> (20mg/kg/day for 5 days and 10mg/kg/day for 5 days) to the ALG group and a low dose of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi> (2mg/kg/day for 5 days) to the ALG plus CSA group were administered simultaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results were as follows: 1) Sixteen (69.6%) out of twenty-three patients treated with ALG plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">Cyclosporin A</z:chebi> showed higher responses (CR: 48%, PR: 22%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>On the contrary, nine out of nineteen in the ALG group showed lower responses (CR: 21%, PR: 26%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>2) Our data showed a tendency that male patients in age ranging from sixteen to thirty years showed an excellent response to ALG therapy (12/23: 52.2%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>3) The ALG plus CSA group revealed a faster response compared to the ALG alone group (15/16 within 6 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>4) We speculate that ALG plus CSA therapy might be the treatment of choice for patients with a moderate degree of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>5) Adding CSA to ALG increased the chance of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e>, such as those with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">URI</z:e>-like symptoms, but it did not affect the mortality rate </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest that the ALG plus CSA regimen may be a more useful therapeutic modality for patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> who cannot be candidates for bone marrow transplantation and a randomized multicenter study is needed for confirmation of our preliminary study </plain></SENT>
