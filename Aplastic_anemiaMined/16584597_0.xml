<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow specimens from 32 patients with AA and 16 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls were studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The number of bone marrow microvessels was examined by means of immunohistochemical staining for CD34 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Determination of microvessel density (MVD) and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> grading were done in a blinded manner </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the bone marrow MVD in patients with AA was significantly lower than that in healthy subjects (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MVD in patients with severe and moderate AA was lower than that in control group, respectively (P &lt; 0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>There is significant MVD difference between severe AA and moderate AA (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>Angiogenesis</z:mpath> grade and MVD in AA were positively correlated (r = 0.64, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that bone marrow <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> in AA patients is lower than that in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Defect of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_177'>angiogenesis</z:mpath> in bone marrow may play a role resulting in or aggravating hematopoietic <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> in patients with AA </plain></SENT>
