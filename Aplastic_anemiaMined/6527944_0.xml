<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The efficacy of in vivo administration of a 5 alpha-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35509">androstane</z:chebi> and two 5 beta-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35509">androstanes</z:chebi> (3 alpha and 3 beta) on CFU/GM and CFU/E mouse bone marrow stem cells was compared </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The subjects were two groups of Swiss Webster mice: one <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> group and one group in whom <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> was induced by irradiation followed by mesenteric node lymphocyte grafting from C57/Bl donor mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> animals, the two types of <z:chebi fb="5" ids="50113">androgens</z:chebi> (5 alpha and 5 beta) had the same efficacy, and the injection of 5 beta-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35509">androstane</z:chebi>, before that of 5 alpha, significantly increased its efficacy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In aplastic mice, 5 alpha and 5 beta-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35509">androstanes</z:chebi> had the same efficacy on CFU/E but 5 beta-<z:chebi fb="0" ids="35509">androstanes</z:chebi> were more efficient on the granulopoietic committed stem cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The efficacy of the association of the two compounds in aplastic mice was not superior to that of each drug alone, which can be explained by the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> of the stem cell compartment induced by the stimulating effect of the first <z:chebi fb="3" ids="50113">androgen</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
