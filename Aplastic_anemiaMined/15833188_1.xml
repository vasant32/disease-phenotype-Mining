<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>Thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> is the earliest phenomenon or the only one in certain phases of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019087" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemorrhagic diseases</z:e>, such as <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>By now, the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> in different diseases has not been clearly determined </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>At present, it is very difficult to diagnose these diseases and estimate their prognosis with current clinical data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study, morphological characteristics and hematopoiesis function of bone marrow megakaryocyte in pediatric patients with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi>, AA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> were observed and the cause and mechanism of different <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenias</z:hpo> were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>METHODS: There were 16 children with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi>, 17 with AA and 16 with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> in this study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>CD41 McAb immunohistochemical technique was used to detect micromegakaryocyte on bone marrow smears </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Plasma clot culture and CD41 McAb immunohistochemical technique were used for the MK-colony forming assay </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The colony formation rate of colony formation unit-megakaryocyte (CFU-MK) and burst formation unit-megakaryocyte (BFU-MK) were counted </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was no statistical difference on the positive rates of micromegakaryocyte and type I lymphoid small micromegakaryocyte between groups of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> and control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The number of micromegakaryocyte and the formation rates of CFU-MK in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> group were significantly higher than those in control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Among AA patients, the numbers of MK, micromegakaryocyte and the formation rates of CFU-MK, BFU-MK in vitro significantly decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in the positive rate of micromegakaryocyte between groups of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and control, but the number of micromegakaryocyte and the positive rate of type I lymphoid micromegakaryocyte were significantly higher than those of control group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There was no statistical difference of the formation rate of CFU-MK between groups of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>But in 63% childhood patients, the formation rate of CFU-MK decreased, 25% increased,and 13% was <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>; BFU-MK formation rate decreased significantly in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Overproliferation of bone MKs may exist in most <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>For obviating the nosogenetic factors, the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> MK releasing platelet could be easily found in the culture system </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>But the colony formation rate of MK decreased in a few patients with CITP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>The abnormality of MK might be one of the reasons for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> in partial patients with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>Underproliferation of MKs may exist in AA, but no pathosishemogenesis was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>The dysfunction of early phase MK progenitor and stem cell might be the major reason for AA, but not the abnormality of hematopoietic microenvironment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>There may be two kinds of megakaryocyte clones in bone marrow of children with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>One may be pathologic and potentially malignant micromegakaryocytes, the other may be the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> megakaryocytic precursors </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>The increase of pathologic MK resulted in abnormal development and maturation of MK in bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>The change of megakaryopoiesis showed different in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi>, AA or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Using bone marrow smear megakaryocyte counting, small micromegakaryocyte immunohistochemical detecting and the formation rate of bone marrow MK colony assay, the different <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> can be diagnosed during the early stage of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi>, AA or <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
