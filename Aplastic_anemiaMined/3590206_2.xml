<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It is derived from petroleum and coal and is used both as a solvent and as a starting material in chemical syntheses </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The numerous industrial uses of <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> over the last century need not be recounted here, but the most recent addition to the list of uses of <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> is as a component in a mixture of aromatic compounds added to gasoline for the purpose of replacing <z:chebi fb="3" ids="33585">lead compounds</z:chebi> as anti-knock ingredients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The best known and longest recognized toxic effect of <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> is the <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> of bone marrow function seen in occupationally exposed individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These people have been found to display <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0023530" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">leucopenia</z:e>, and/or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>When <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo>, i.e., the simultaneous <z:hpo ids='HP_0000716'>depression</z:hpo> of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three cell types, occurs and is accompanied by bone marrow <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp>, the syndrome is called <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition to observing this decrease in humans and relating it to <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> exposure, it has been possible to establish animal models which mimic the human disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The result has been considerable scientific investigation into the mechanism of <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> toxicity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although the association between <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> exposure and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> has been recognized and accepted throughout most of this century, it is only recently that <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, particularly of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> myelogenous type, has been related to <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The acceptance of <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> as an etiological agent in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> in large measure derives from our ability to reproduce the disease in most animals treated with sufficiently high doses of <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> over the necessary time period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Unfortunately, despite extensive efforts in several laboratories, it has not been possible to establish a reproducible, reliable model for the study of <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi>-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The recent demonstration that several animals exposed to <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> either by inhalation or in the drinking water during studies by Drs </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Maltoni suggests that such a model may be forthcoming </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>Nevertheless, at this time it is not clear whether bone marrow damage of the type that leads to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> is required for the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>Most studies of <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> toxicity have involved dosing animals with <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> either by inhalation or by injection, using high doses to ensure a toxic response </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Very few studies have concentrated on the oral route of administration and none have concentrated on administering <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> by mouth at the low doses occasionally detected in drinking water.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
