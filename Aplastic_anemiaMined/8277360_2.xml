<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Different groups of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> including <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, infiltrative marrow disorder, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001971'>hypersplenism</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001889'>megaloblastic anemia</z:hpo> were recruited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients had bone marrow examinations for morphological diagnosis and reticulocyte evaluation using an automated counter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The roles of these parameters were then analyzed statistically in the differential evaluation among these conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The following subjects were studied: 292 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects, 67 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, 69 cases of marrow infiltration by different <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e>, 35 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001971'>hypersplenism</z:hpo>, and 13 cases of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001889'>megaloblastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the absolute reticulocyte counts were lowest in the groups of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001889'>megaloblastic anemia</z:hpo> and highest in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001971'>hypersplenism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both showed significant differences from the infiltrative groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The maturation fractions were most immature in the group of marrow infiltration and are significantly different from the other groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>It was concluded that the highest absolute reticulocyte count (&gt; 0.09 10(12)/L) obtained in pancytopenic patients suggests it to be a case of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001971'>hypersplenism</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The lowest counts (&lt; 0.03 10(12)/L) with lowest immature fractions (&lt; 10%) suggest the groups of aplastic or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001889'>megaloblastic anemias</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The highest immature fractions (&gt; 30%) with a nearly <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> reticulocyte count favor the group of marrow infiltration </plain></SENT>
