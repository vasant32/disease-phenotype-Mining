<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>An automated reticulocyte counter using flowcytometric analysis, the R-3000 (Sysmex Inc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Kobe, Japan), has recently been modified to determine reticulated platelets (RPs) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011877'>large platelets</z:hpo> (LPs) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We measured frequencies of RPs, LPs in total platelet count and serum thrombopoietin concentration comprehensively in non-neoplastic thrombocytopenic patients with immune thrombocytopenic <z:hpo ids='HP_0000979'>purpura</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi>, n = 23), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA, n = 21), liver <z:hpo ids='HP_0001394'>cirrhosis</z:hpo> (LC, n= 17), and hematologically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects (control, n = 151) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> was characterized as high frequencies of both RP and LP, AA as high RP frequency and elevated thrombopoietin concentration, and LC as no difference compared with control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Interestingly, the frequency of RP appeared to depend on total platelet count rather than the cause of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo>, while the frequency of LP appeared to depend much less on total platelet count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, significant positive correlations were observed between frequencies of RP and LP in control, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi> and LC subjects, in whom bone marrow stem cells are intrinsically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, there was no such correlation in AA patients with stem cell deficiency, suggesting that this correlation might be a useful new parameter for detecting qualitatively abnormal platelets </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Measurement of RP and LP is thus useful for elucidating the pathophysiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0040034" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">thrombocytopenic disorders</z:e> </plain></SENT>
