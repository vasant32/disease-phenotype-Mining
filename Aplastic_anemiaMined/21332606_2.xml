<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">malignancies</z:e> increases after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), and the role of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0850011,C0850009" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">human papillomavirus</z:e> (HPV) in FA <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0596263" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">carcinogenesis</z:e> have been proposed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate prevalence of oral HPV in FA patients without oral malignant lesions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: After oral examination, 76 subjects without detectable oral malignant lesions were included and classified in four groups: 20 FA submitted to HSCT (I), 22 FA not submitted to HSCT (II), 18 severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (SAA) submitted to HSCT (III) and 16 healthy subjects (IV) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Liquid-based cytology sampling, HPV screening by polymerase chain reaction and genotyping by reverse hybridization were performed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The HPV detection rates were: group I 35%, group II 27.3%, group III 38% and group IV 6.25% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Prevalence of high risk HPV types, mainly HPV16, was detected </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Compared with control group, suggestions for increased likelihood of being HPV infected in SAA (OR = 9.55, 95% CI: 1.01-125.41) and FA patients submitted to HSCT (OR = 8.08, 0.83-72.29) emerged </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Patients without oral malignant lesions submitted to HSCT, have high prevalence of oral HPV </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>HPV screening and close follow up should be considered in these patients </plain></SENT>
