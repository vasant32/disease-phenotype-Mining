<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To investigate the significance of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> F-containing erythroblasts (F-blasts) and p53 expression in making the distinction between hypo RA and acquired AA, we immunohistochemically assessed F-blasts and p53 in bone marrow specimens from 16 patients with hypo RA, 31 patients with acquired AA, and 15 hematologically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>F-blast production was elevated in 87.5% (14/16) of patients with hypo RA, but in only 3.2% (1/31) of patients with AA (P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>p53 was overexpressed in 75.0% (12/16) of hypo RA patients and in 6.4% (2/31) of AA patients (P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean contents of F-blasts and p53-positive cells in patients with hypo RA were 6.31% +/- 3.27% and 7.54% +/- 4.36%, respectively, of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> bone marrow cells, which were significantly higher than for patients with AA (0.35% +/- 0.46% and 0.58% +/- 1.29%, P &lt; .01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, a high prevalence of elevated F-blast production is noted in hypo RA, suggesting that the assessment of F-blasts in bone marrow can be used as an additional tool for differentiating hypo RA from acquired AA </plain></SENT>
