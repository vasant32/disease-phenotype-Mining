<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively analyzed results for 154 patients with acquired severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> who received bone marrow transplants between 1993 and 2000 from unrelated donors identified through the Japan Marrow Donor Program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients were aged between 1 and 46 years (median, 17 years) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Seventy-nine donor-patient pairs matched at HLA-A, -B, and -DRB1 loci, as shown by DNA typing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Among the 75 mismatched pairs, DNA typing of 63 pairs showed that 51 were mismatched at 1 HLA locus (18 HLA-A, 11 HLA-B, 22 HLA-DRB1) and 12 were mismatched at 2 or more loci </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seventeen patients (11%) experienced either early or late graft rejection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The incidence of grade III/IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft versus host disease</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft versus host disease</z:e> was 20% (range, 7%-33%) and 30% (range, 12%-48%), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Currently, 99 patients are alive, having survived for 3 to 82 months (median, 29 months) after their transplantations </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The probability of overall survival at 5 years was 56% (95% confidence interval, 34%-78%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Multivariate analysis revealed the following unfavorable factors: transplantation more than 3 years after diagnosis (relative risk [RR], 1.86; P =.02), patients older than 20 years (RR, 2.27; P =.03), preconditioning regimen without antithymocyte globulin (RR 2.28; P =.04), and HLA-A or -B locus mismatching as determined by DNA typing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Matching of HLA class I alleles and improvement of preparative regimens should result in improved outcomes in patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> who receive transplants from unrelated donors </plain></SENT>
