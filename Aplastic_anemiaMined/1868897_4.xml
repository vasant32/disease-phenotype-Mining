<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to test whether large amounts of recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rhGM-CSF) are capable of promoting the growth of hemopoietic progenitors from patients with marrow failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>For this purpose 0.1, 100, 1000, 10,000 and 20,000 ng/ml of rhGM-CSF were added to 10(5) light-density (adherent cell-depleted) bone marrow cells from 9 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls and from 52 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, 25 cases of which were transfusion-dependent (Tx-D) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) and 27 of which were transfusion-independent (Tx-I) <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A dose-dependent increase of granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units (CFU-GM) was observed in healthy donors, from 81 to 247 colonies at 0.1 and 1000 ng/ml of rhGM-CSF, with a plateau thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Tx-I AA patients showed the best increase of CFU-GM in response to colony-stimulating factor, from 0.1 to 32.7 mean colonies at 0.1 and 20,000 ng/ml of rhGM-CSF, and the increment was greater when compared to controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The ratio of CFU-GM grown from these patients and controls was 1:810 at 0.1 ng/ml of rhGM-CSF and 1:7.9 at 20,000 ng/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Eleven patients were studied at diagnosis; there was no in vitro response to rhGM-CSF (0 and 1.8 mean colonies/10(5) cells at 0.1 and 10,000 ng/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Overall, Tx-D AA patients showed minimal increments of CFU-GM growth at very high doses of rhGM-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Two suggestions come from this study: 1) maturation of CFU-GM from recovering AA patients appears to require larger doses of GM-CSF than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls, and 2) very high doses of rhGM-CSF have little or no effect on CFU-GM growth in AA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This may be relevant for clinical studies designed to improve hemopoiesis in patients with marrow failure </plain></SENT>
