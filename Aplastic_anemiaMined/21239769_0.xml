<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Barriers to the use of unrelated-donor transplantation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> include identifying a suitable alternative donor, and risks of graft failure, regimen-related toxicity, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Despite the more than 14 million adults registered with donor registries worldwide, only approximately 50% of patients of Caucasian descent will have an available and fully HLA-matched unrelated adult donor; the rate is substantially lower for non-Caucasians </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>While umbilical cord blood allows transplantation with greater donor-recipient HLA disparity (without excessive risk of GVHD), risks of graft failure and transplant-related mortality are higher than after transplantation of adult donor grafts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Among patients with a suitable donor, recent changes in pre-transplant conditioning regimens have lowered the risks of organ toxicity and graft failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Although advances in donor HLA typing and selection practices and improved GVHD prophylaxis have lowered the risk, GVHD remains an important obstacle to long-term symptom-free survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Despite these limitations, unrelated-donor transplantation offers the best chance of long-term survival for many patients in whom current immunosuppression strategies are not effective </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Wider applicability of alternative-donor transplantation for <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> will require better approaches to prevent graft failure and GVHD and to expand the pool of unrelated-donor grafts </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>This includes exploring strategies to effectively use alternative grafts such as umbilical cord blood </plain></SENT>
