<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow patterns of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> on STIR images were classified into five types: 1) homogeneously low intensity fatty marrow, 2) fatty marrow with scattered hematopoietic nodules, 3) fatty marrow with marginal hematopoietic regions, 4) fatty marrow surrounded by bandlike hematopoietic regions, and 5) homogeneously high-signal-intensity hematopoietic marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>STIR images defined the fatty marrow as a markedly hypointense region and the hematopoietic marrow as a high signal intense area </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Many cases included the homogeneously fatty marrow and fatty marrow with marginal hematopoietic areas, whereas marrow with a broad range of hematopoiesis was detected in patients younger than 40 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MR</z:e> images also demonstrated that fatty marrow could shift to hematopoietic marrow following therapy </plain></SENT>
