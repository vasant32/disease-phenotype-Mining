<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>It is unclear how a <z:hpo ids='HP_0004818'>paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>) clone expands in bone marrow, although immune mechanisms involving cytotoxic T lymphocytes, autosomal proliferation, and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_3'>apoptosis</z:mpath> resistance have been hypothesized </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To clarify aspects of immune mechanisms and proliferation of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> cells, we investigated HLA-DRB1, -DQA1, and -DQB1 alleles by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based genotyping and expression of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027708" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">Wilms' tumor</z:e> gene, WT1, by real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) in 21 PNH and 21 <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>HLA genotyping indicated that the frequency of DRB1*1501, DQA1*0102, and DQB1*0602 alleles in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> patients and of DQB1*0602 allele in AA patients was significantly higher than in 916 Japanese controls, and that the HLA-DRB1*1501-DQA1*0102-DQB1*0602 haplotype, found in 13 of 21 PNH patients, 5 of 7 AA-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> syndrome patients, and 7 of 21 AA patients showed significant differences compared with healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RT-PCR analysis showed that the mean values of WT1 <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> were 3413, 712, and 334 copies/microg <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>, AA, and healthy individuals, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The values for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> patients were significantly higher than for AA patients and healthy volunteers and were correlated with the proportion of CD16b(-) granulocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The high frequency of HLA-DRB1*1501-DQA1*0102-DQB1*0602 haplotype in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>, including AA-<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> syndrome, and AA patients suggests that linkage exists between the disorders and that immune mechanisms in an HLA-restricted manner play an important role in the pathogenesis of these disorders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, high expression of WT1 <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> patients is related to a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> clone, but it remains unclear whether this causes expansion of a <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> clone </plain></SENT>
