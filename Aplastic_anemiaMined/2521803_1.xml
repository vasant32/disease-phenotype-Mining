<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>In patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (SAA), lymphocyte subpopulations were examined for the presence of HLA-DR and 2H4 (suppressor/inducer subset) antigen-expressing cells by flow cytometric analysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Investigations were performed on peripheral blood lymphocytes before and after therapy with antithymocyte globulin (ATG) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi> (MP), as well as on bone-marrow lymphocytes before therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Before treatment, only the absolute numbers of CD4+ T cells and the CD4+HLA-DR+/CD8+HLA-DR+ activated T cell ratio were significantly decreased (p less than 0.01 and p less than 0.001, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Following successful ATG/MP treatment, a decrease in the CD4+/CD8+ T cell ratio was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Regarding the suppressor/inducer subset, only absolute numbers of CD4+/2H4+ cells were somewhat higher in treated patients; the percentages were the same in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> groups of patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Studies performed on bone-marrow lymphocytes showed significantly decreased percentages of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes, which also express HLA-DR antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No significant changes in the distribution of activated T cells following ATG/MP therapy were found, suggesting that these cells play no major role in the pathogenesis of the disease </plain></SENT>
