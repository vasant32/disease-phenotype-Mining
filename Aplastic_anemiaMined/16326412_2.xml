<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The response was 27, 50, and 79%, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The statistical analysis showed that the protocol of intensive immunosuppressive treatment (IST) was the most effective one and CsA was better than that of SSL-6 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>None of our patients developed clone diseases although the follow-up was as long as more than to 9 years </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is effective treatment for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) </plain></SENT>
