<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cultures from 23 of the 35 patients grew scanty stromal cell layers or did not produce any adherent cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Long-term cultures from the remaining patients formed adherent cell layers that appeared to be morphologically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cultures from 7 patients that grew apparently <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> adherent cell layers were examined for expression of intermediate filament proteins using antibodies CGA-7 and HHF, which respectively recognize actin <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53000">epitopes</z:chebi> expressed in smooth muscle and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> marrow stromal cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Cells from 4 of the 7 patients expressed vimentin (antibody 43 beta E8) but did not react with CGA-7 or HHF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It thus appears that most patients with AA have quantitative or qualitative abnormalities in the adherent cell layers from long-term marrow cultures, suggesting a defect in the hematopoietic microenvironment </plain></SENT>
