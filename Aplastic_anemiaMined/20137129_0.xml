<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>HLA-DR15 expression was detected by PCR-SSP; immunoglobulin was detected by immune turbidimetry; T cell subsets were detected by flow cytometry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the expression rates of HLA-DR15 in AA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> as well as <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control groups were 78.6%, 63.2% and 24.6% respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The difference between AA, <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and the <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control groups was statistically significant (p &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>OR (odds ratios) values of AA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> groups were 11.262, 4.710 respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Compared with <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control group, expression rate of HLA-DR15 in <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancy</z:e> group was not significantly different </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The immunoglobulin level and abnormal T cell subsets in AA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> groups were statistically different between HLA-DR15 positive and negative groups (p &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that the frequency of HLA-DR15 antigen in AA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients is significantly higher than that in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> control and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancy</z:e> group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>OR value&gt;1 showed a positive correlation between the diseases and HLA-DR15 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>HLA-DR15 is a susceptible gene in AA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
