<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The treatment options for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> who do not respond to conventional immunosuppression are limited </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to evaluate high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> in patients with refractory severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (SAA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: We treated 17 SAA patients with high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (50 mg/kg/day for 4 consecutive days) who previously did not respond to one or more courses of immunosuppressive therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Median age was 31 years (range 6-58); median disease duration was 14 months (range 6-58), and 8 patients met criteria for very severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (absolute neutrophil count &lt;0.2 x 10(9)/L) at the time of treatment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At median follow-up of 29 months, 10 patients (59%) are alive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Nine patients (53%) achieved a drug-free remission after high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>; 4 patients achieved a complete remission and 5 patients currently meet criteria for a partial remission but continue to improve </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One nonresponder to high-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0004818'>paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</z:hpo>; another nonresponder developed a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In responding patients, median time to 500 neutrophils was 54 days (range 35-119), median time to the last platelet transfusion was 99 days (range 51-751), and median time to the last red cell transfusion was 125 days (range 63-796) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: High-dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> shows promise for salvaging patients with refractory SAA </plain></SENT>
