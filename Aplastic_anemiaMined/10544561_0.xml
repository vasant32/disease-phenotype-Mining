<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The methods for preparing the specimens of liquid media of the organism and the RFA are simple, rapid, involve no disintegration of the sample, and allow measurements of elements at sigma 1 = 0.02 at concentrations of 12 micrograms/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The method is preferable and promising for some basic elements (P, S, Cl, K, Ca), which are difficult to measure by other methods </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The levels of S, K, Ca, Fe, Zn, and Cu were measured in erythrocytic mass and blood serum of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects, patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002099'>asthma</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, and recipients of allogenic kidneys </plain></SENT>
