<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>As many as 10% to 57% of these patients, however, develop <z:hpo ids='HP_0004818'>paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We and others have observed that this secondary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> appears to be more indolent than classical <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>, which results from an acquired mutation in the PIG-A gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In the present study, we compared PIG-A <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> transcripts in affected cells from patients with secondary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> and patients with classical <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> four of our aplastic patients who developed <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> had a negative Ham test at diagnosis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Two of the four showed a positive Ham test within 3 months after ATG/cyclosporin administration, one developed a positive test at 6 months, and another at 18 months after immunosuppressive therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> four patients remain transfusion-independent with no thrombotic episodes after a mean follow-up of 30 months (range, 6 to 63 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of PIG-A transcripts in DAF-/CD59- neutrophils or lymphocyte lines of the four patients showed PIG-A abnormalities in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Transition of C163 to T was found in one, a 14-bp deletion (positions 1141 to 1154) was found in the second, deletion of C39 was found in the third, and two mutations, transition of C55 to T and transversion of T762 to A, were found in the fourth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These abnormalities compared with findings of abnormal <z:chebi fb="40" ids="33697">RNA</z:chebi> splicing causing a 133-bp deletion, a 4-bp insertion (between positions 578 and 579), loss of A767, and loss of C575 in four patients with primary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>We conclude that secondary <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> that evolves out of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, like classical <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>, is associated with mutations in the PIG-A gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The apparent indolent nature of this disease probably reflects early detection </plain></SENT>
