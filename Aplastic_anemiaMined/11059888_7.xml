<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Dry-platelets are those collected along with 25-30 ml of contaminating plasma cell with separators such as the Amicus, AS 104 and the Excel Pro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Platelets are resuspended in non plasma media for storage and for at least 60 hours their viability and functionality are not impaired </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In this article we report on two hemolytic crises determined by two O Rh D + units of single donor platelets (SPD) taken from the same donor in a double-apheresis session </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The two split units were administered to two A Rh D + patients suffering from metastatic <z:hpo ids='HP_0003002'>breast cancer</z:hpo> and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (SAA) respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In both cases the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0235575" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">hemolytic reaction</z:e> was of the intravascular type, with a drop in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> (Hgb) level from 8.6 to 5.4 and from 8.8 down to 5.3 g/dl respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>From the patients' RBC only alpha agglutinins were eluted and donor's indirect antiglobulin test (IAT) was negative with extended panel RBCs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In the first case the clinical course after erythroexchange (Erex) was uneventful whereas in the second one, that suffering from SAA, after Erex, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001919'>acute renal failure</z:hpo> and shock did complicate the clinical course and the patient died seven days after the incriminated platelet transfusion </plain></SENT>
