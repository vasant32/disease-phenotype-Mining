<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients received oral busulphan 4 mg/kg/day/2 days, IV <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> 350 mg/m(2)/day/3 days, and fludarabine 30 mg/m(2)/day/3 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>For GVHD prophylaxis, patients received MTX 5 mg/m(2) days +1, +3, +6, and +11 and oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> (CyA) 5 mg/kg/day, starting on day -1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Peripheral blood stem cell products were used with a median dose of 5.5 x 10(6) CD34(+)/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patients were followed for an average of 25 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>By a median of day +11, an ANC &gt; 0.5 x 10(9)/L was reached; and by day +12, the platelet count had reached &gt;20,000 x 10(9)/L </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>Acute</z:hpo> grade I-II GVHD occurred in 4 patients, whereas limited <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD presented in 6 cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Twenty-one patients (91.3%) achieved engraftment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Two patients failed to engraft, and 4 developed late rejection; 2 of these individuals died, 2 have survived with high transfusion requirements, whereas 2 received a second peripheral blood stem cell infusion and achieved sustained engraftment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Currently 21 (91%) of the 23 patients are alive, whereas 19 of 21 (90%) remain in complete remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The average cost was about USD 15,000 for this kind of reduced-intensity allotransplant </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Reduced-intensity stem cell transplantation represents an affordable alternative to traditional more cytotoxic conditioning for severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (SAA) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Long-term effects however, remain to be evaluated </plain></SENT>
