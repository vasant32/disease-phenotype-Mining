<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Twelve patients had no detectable in-vitro defect that could be responsible for the low CFU-C numbers </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Three patients had suppressor T cells that inhibited CFU-C (p less than 0.001); one of two patients responded to antithymocyte globulin therapy and the third recovered spontaneously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Three patients had serum inhibitory immunoglobulins directed against their marrow CFU-C; plasmapheresis resulted in recovery of bone marrow function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Three patients had abnormalities at the colony-stimulating factor level: Two had inhibitors of colony-stimulating factor, corrected in vitro and in vivo by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="49662">indomethacin</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="38324">cholinergic agonists</z:chebi> (p less than 0.01); and the third had colony-stimulating factor generation defect, corrected in vitro and in vivo by <z:chebi fb="32" ids="30145">lithium</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Testing for cellular or humoral suppressor factors directed against precursor cells or for abnormalities at the colony-stimulating factor level gives helpful guidelines to therapy in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
