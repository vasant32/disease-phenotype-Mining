<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Interactions between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6076">itraconazole</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">sirolimus</z:chebi> are known to occur in patients after solid organ transplantation, but interactions in hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients have yet to be reported in the literature </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We describe an allogeneic HSCT recipient who experienced supratherapeutic trough levels of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">sirolimus</z:chebi> as a result of its coadministration with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6076">itraconazole</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This patient was a 20-year-old African-American man who underwent HSCT for treatment of <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After several regimen changes, the patient received oral <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6076">itraconazole</z:chebi> 200 mg every 12 hours and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">sirolimus</z:chebi> at a dosage of 7 mg/day on days 76-80 and 5 mg/day on days 81 and 82 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>His <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">sirolimus</z:chebi> whole blood trough levels were 17.5 and 35.6 ng/ml on days 80 and 82, respectively (therapeutic range 5-15 ng/ml) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>An interaction between <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6076">itraconazole</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">sirolimus</z:chebi> was suspected, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">sirolimus</z:chebi> was withheld on days 83-90 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>On day 90, the patient's <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">sirolimus</z:chebi> trough level had normalized to 4.4 ng/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">Sirolimus</z:chebi> was resumed at 1-2 mg/day, with adjustments as needed to maintain trough levels of 10-15 ng/ml </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Both the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6076">itraconazole</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">sirolimus</z:chebi> were eventually were discontinued </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">Sirolimus</z:chebi> is extremely sensitive to the inhibitory potential of azole antifungals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>We propose that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6076">itraconazole</z:chebi> also has a potent effect on <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">sirolimus</z:chebi> metabolism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Preemptive <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">sirolimus</z:chebi> dosage reduction and close monitoring of its whole blood trough levels are required whenever this combination is considered to avoid <z:chebi fb="1" ids="35705">immunosuppressant</z:chebi> toxicity in already <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010340" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">critically ill</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
