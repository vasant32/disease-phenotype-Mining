<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To explore the effects of ligustrazine on bone marrow microenvironment and its mechanism in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Each immune-induced AA mouse was gastric fed by 4 mg ligustrazine twice a day </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On the 10th day, the ulnar bone marrow partial pressure of oxygen (PbO2) was determined in vivo by a <z:chebi fb="3" ids="37370">PO2</z:chebi> sensory needle </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Then the histological features, fibroblastic colony forming unit (CFU-F) yields and the adhesive function of stromal cells of the bone marrow were assayed in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The PbO2 in ligustrazine-treated group was 10.32 +/- 1.27 kPa, while in AA group was 4.32 +/- 2.86 kPa (P &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In AA group, the microvessels were expanded, broken and being stasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The percentage of hematopoietic tissue volume was 24.9% +/- 9.6% and the CFU-F yields was 12.5 +/- 7.3/2 x 10(6) BMNC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The microvessels in ligustrazine group were more clear and intact, not being broken and had no stasis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The percentage of hematopoietic tissue volume was 52.8% +/- 15.6% and the CFU-F yields was 31.5 +/- 10.6/2 x 10(6) BMNC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>In ligustrazine group, the adhesive function of stromal cell layer cultured with bone marrow nucleated cells from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> mice was 72.7% +/- 7.8%, which was not different from that in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> group (73.4% +/- 3.4%), but much higher than that in AA group (56.2% +/- 9.8%, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Ligustrazine can promote the rehabilitation of bone marrow microvessels in AA mice, increasing the oxygen supply for bone marrow microenvironment, promoting the growth of stromal cells and strengthening their adhesive function </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Ligustrazine enbances the bone marrow hematopoietic cells proliferation by improving their microenvironment </plain></SENT>
