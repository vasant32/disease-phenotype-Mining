<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>We conducted a phase I-II clinical trial to test the hypothesis that removal of CD4 cells from an HLA-mismatched unrelated marrow graft would substantially reduce the risk of grades III-IV <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) and that retention of a specified number of CD8 cells in the graft would be sufficient to prevent rejection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients were eligible for this study when an HLA-A, -B, or -DRB1-matched unrelated donor could not be identified </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>HLA matching of the donor and recipient was based on typing of HLA-A and -B antigens by serologic methods and by typing of HLA-DRB1 alleles by molecular methods, and donors were selected when disparity was limited to a single HLA-DRB1 allele or a single HLA-A or -B antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-seven patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancy</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> were prepared to receive a transplant with conventional regimens of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> and fractionated total body irradiation, and a standard regimen of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> was given for GVHD prophylaxis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>CD4 cells were removed from the donor marrow, and the numbers of CD8 cells were adjusted systematically in graded steps for successive patients, depending on the occurrence of grades III-IV GVHD or graft failure in previously enrolled patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Removal of CD4 cells did not cause graft rejection or appreciably decrease the risk of grades III-IV GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>Depletion</z:mpath> of CD8 cells was associated with an increased risk of rejection with either HLA-DRB1 disparity or with HLA-A or -B disparity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>With either type of disparity, the risk of grades III-IV GVHD is likely to be higher than 15% at any dose of CD8 cells associated with less than 5% risk of graft failure </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The absence of graft failure associated with CD4 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_63'>depletion</z:mpath> supports the hypothesis that donor CD4 cells are not essential for preventing marrow graft rejection in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The correlation between graft failure and the number of CD8 cells in the donor marrow supports the hypothesis that donor CD8 cells help to prevent marrow graft rejection </plain></SENT>
