<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Such presentation of ALL is externally rare in adults and until now only few such cases have been reported </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We present a 40-year-old male with ALL common type, which developed 14 months after the diagnosis of severe AA, successfully treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="50858">corticosteroids</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>ALL was treated with standard induction chemotherapy but remission has not been achieved </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The patient died 6 weeks after the diagnosis of ALL because of central <z:mp ids='MP_0008912'>nervous</z:mp> system <z:mp ids='MP_0001914'>bleeding</z:mp> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The pattern of IgH gene rearrangement analyzed with PCR method in bone marrow from the period of AA diagnosis and in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from ALL diagnosis showed two different monoclonal IgH configurations as the results of biallelic monoclonal rearrangement of IgH genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The observed bands in both specimens were identical and indicated that leukemic cells originated from B-cell progenitor were also present in the bone marrow when AA was diagnosed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We suggest that molecular analysis of monoclonality in patients with AA may be important for proper selection of the rare cases of ALL first presenting as marrow <z:mpath ids='MPATH_58'>aplasia</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
