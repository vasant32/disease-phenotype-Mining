<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Alternative donor (AD) transplants may be an option for these patients, but such therapies have been associated with greater incidence of graft failure and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively analyzed 36 pediatric patients who received 38 bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell transplants (15 MSD and 23 AD) for SAA at our institution from April 1997 to October 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Nineteen AD recipients received reduced intensity conditioning with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, low-dose total body irradiation, and antithymocyte globulin (ATG) or Campath </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The 4-year overall survival for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MSD</z:e> recipients was 93% versus 89% for AD recipients treated with reduced intensity conditioning regimens at a median follow-up of 52 months (range, 6-99 months) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No patient receiving Campath, compared with 3 of 9 patients receiving ATG, developed extensive, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We conclude that, for children with SAA, AD transplantation is as effective as <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MSD</z:e> transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Further, compared with ATG, preparatory regimens containing Campath may be associated with a lower incidence of extensive, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GHVD </plain></SENT>
