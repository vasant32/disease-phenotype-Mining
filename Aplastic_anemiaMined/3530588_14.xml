<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">Cyclosporine</z:chebi> pharmacokinetics were studied during the first 2 posttransplant weeks after an intravenous dose of 2.6 to 3.5 mg/kg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Serum <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> concentrations were measured by HPLC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">Cyclosporine</z:chebi> concentration-time data were fitted to a two-compartment model with a nonlinear regression program </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a significant inverse linear correlation between age and both total systemic clearance (CL) (r = 0.42; P less than 0.001) and volume of distribution at steady-state (Vss) (r = 0.33; P less than 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mean (+/- SE) <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> CL was 82 +/- 21, 45 +/- 5, 38 +/- 9, 44 +/- 8, and 20 +/- 3 ml/min/kg and mean <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> Vss was 34 +/- 11, 28 +/- 10, 15 +/- 4, 14 +/- 5, and 4.7 +/- 0.7 L/kg in patients 0 to 10 (n = 12), 11 to 20 (n = 19), 21 to 30 (n = 12), 31 to 40 (n = 17), and greater than 40 (n = 9) years old, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Patients 0 to 10 years old had a significantly higher <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> CL than those 11 to 40 or greater than 40 years old and also had a significantly larger Vss than those greater than 40 yrs old (P less than 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Age-related differences in CL or Vss were also observed when these parameters were normalized by body surface area.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </plain></SENT>
