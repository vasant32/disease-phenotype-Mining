<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the expression levels of the receptor for urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPAR) on granulocytes and the soluble uPAR (suPAR) level in plasma from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0004818'>paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>) and its clinical application in the diagnosis of this disorder </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Expression of uPAR, CD55 and CD59 was measured on granulocytes by using flow cytometry (FCM) and the level of suPAR in plasma by using immunoradiometric assay (IRMA) in 20 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>, 59 anemic patients with diagnoses other than <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> (18 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001890'>autoimmune hemolytic anemia</z:hpo>, 6 with other <z:hpo ids='HP_0001878'>hemolytic anemias</z:hpo>, 26 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and 9 with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001891'>iron deficiency anemia</z:hpo>) and 21 healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> patients, both the mean fluorescence intensity and percentage of positive fluorescence-activated granulocytes of uPAR, CD55 and CD59 were remarkably decreased, while in anemic patients with diagnoses other than <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> the results were not different when compared with those of the healthy individuals </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The expression level of uPAR was reduced to the same extent as that of CD55 and CD59 on the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e>-affected granulocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In addition, some peak shape abnormalities (double peaks and/or peak tailing) in the histogram of fluorescence intensity were also found in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The suPAR concentration of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> plasma was (4.04 +/- 2.47) micrograms/L, being higher than that of the healthy individuals (1.73 +/- 0.96) micrograms/L (P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>And the percentage of positive fluorescence-activated granulocytes was inversely associated with the plasma suPAR level in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> patients (r = -0.79, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: It is suggested that measurement of expression level of uPAR on granulocytes with FCM and suPAR in plasma with IRMA would be alteanative specific techniques for the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> </plain></SENT>
