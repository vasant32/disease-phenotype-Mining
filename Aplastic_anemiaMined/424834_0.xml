<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>He then received <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27902">tetracycline</z:chebi> for eight days, 500 mg orally four times daily, for a total dose of 15 gm </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Twelve days after discontinuation of the drug, a severe but reversible <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> developed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We propose that bone-marrow-toxic concentrations of <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27902">tetracycline</z:chebi> resulted from the preexisting <z:hpo ids='HP_0000083'>renal insufficiency</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Because of the temporal relationship between <z:chebi fb="9" ids="27902">tetracycline</z:chebi> administration and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, and the lack of any other explanation, we conclude that this case illustrates a rare but potentially fatal complication of this drug </plain></SENT>
