<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Overexpression of and hematopoietic inhibition by IFN-gamma has been observed in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> of these conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In vitro, IFN-gamma exhibits strong inhibitory effects on hematopoietic progenitor and stem cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Previously, we have studied the transcriptome of CD34 cells derived from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> syndromes and identified characteristic molecular signatures common to some of these conditions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this report, we have investigated genome-wide expression patterns after exposure of CD34 and bone marrow stroma cells derived from <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow to IFN-gamma in vitro and have detected profound changes in the transcription profile </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Some of these changes were concordant in both stroma and CD34 cells, whereas others were specific to CD34 cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In general, our results were in agreement with the previously described function of IFN-gamma in CD34 cells involving activation of apoptotic pathways and immune response genes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Comparison between the IFN-gamma transcriptome in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CD34 cells and changes previously detected in CD34 cells from AA and <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">PNH</z:e> patients reveals the presence of many similarities that may reflect molecular signature of in vivo IFN-gamma exposure </plain></SENT>
