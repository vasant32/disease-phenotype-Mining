<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The combination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> with irradiation has had unequivocal success in reconstituting a sustained engraftment, but this procedure has severe associated risks such as <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085183" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">second malignancies</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Recently, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (CYC) plus antithymocyte globulin (ATG) has been shown to be an effective alternative to irradiation-based programs in retransplants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Based on these experiences, the current clinical trial was started to prepare patients suffering from SAA for marrow transplantation from HLA-identical siblings with ATG plus CYC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Nine patients have been enrolled into the study so far </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>They received a total dose of 200 mg/kg CYC and concomitantly 120 mg/kg or 90 mg/kg ATG, followed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> as post-transplantation GVHD prophylaxis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eight of nine patients survived without any transplant-associated complications; i.e., they had a documented stable engraftment without rejection and without <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>One patient died due to an Aspergillus <z:hpo ids='HP_0100806'>sepsis</z:hpo> prior to a definite engraftment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Although our data are preliminary because of the small number of patients enrolled and a follow-up of only 30 months, CYC plus ATG appears to be an effective preparative regimen for BMT in patients with SAA, resulting in a favorable outcome </plain></SENT>
