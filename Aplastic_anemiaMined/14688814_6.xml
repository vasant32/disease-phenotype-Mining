<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Diagnoses included <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> (n=36), <z:hpo ids='HP_0005506'>chronic myelogenous leukemia</z:hpo> (n=27), NHL (n=14), ALL (n=16), <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> (n=9), <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (n=3), and one <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0019829" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="hd">Hodgkin's disease</z:e> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0011974'>myelofibrosis</z:hpo> each </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>In total, 64% were in remission or in <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> phase or had <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (good risk), and 36% had active disease at the time of transplant (bad risk) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo>, 70% were matched sibling transplants and 30% were matched unrelated donor transplants </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The mean follow-up for the patients remaining alive is 48 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Survival was powerfully influenced by the 100-day platelet count: 4-year survival was 19% for patients with a platelet count &lt;30 x 10(9)/l; 41% for patients with a platelet count of 30-50; and 72% for those with a platelet count &gt;50 (P&lt;0.001; log-rank test) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a multivariable analysis, the most powerful risk factors for mortality after allogeneic BMT were low 100-day platelet count (P&lt;0.001) and bad risk disease (P=0.009) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>We conclude that the platelet count 100 days post transplant is a powerful predictor of overall survival </plain></SENT>
