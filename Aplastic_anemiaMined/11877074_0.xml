<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To develop an <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> model with hematopoietic stem cell failure in rats </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>Normal</z:mpath> Wistar rats were injected i.p. with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="46345">5-fluorouracil</z:chebi> and 5 days later p.o. by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi> once a week for 3 times </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A 5-FU alone group and a <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi> alone group were as control </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The parameters tested indices were as following: incidence and mortality of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> rats, blood picture, bone marrow nucleated cell count, CFU-GM of bone marrow cells and histology of hematopoietic organs </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In the 5-FU plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi> group, the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> was 82.0% (40/49 rats), the average survival time was (30.0 +/- 6.5) days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The remained 9 rats developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (18.0%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The total incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> was 100%, and the mortality was 98% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The blood cells count of the <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> rats was gradually reduced to a level of half the premedications and no CFU-GM was detected, and the patho-morphological examination showed that the bone marrow was replaced by fat cells, and the lymphoid tissue of spleen, thymus and lymph-nodes were remarkably atrophied without extra-medullary hematopoiesis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The control group (5-FU treated) developed a transient hematopoiesis suppression, and recovered rapidly to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Three of 12 rats in the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi> treated group developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: 5-FU combined with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi> could impair the hematopoietic stem cells and resulted in an irreversible <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> in rats, making a rat <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> model with hematopoietic stem cell failure </plain></SENT>
