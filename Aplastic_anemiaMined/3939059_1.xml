<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The supernatants were purified by an ACA 44 column and the suppressor activity found in fractions of 70,000-80,000 daltons </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Experiments were then performed to test for endogenous productions of Td/CIA in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> marrow cells (NBM), reversibility of suppression, and competitive inhibition with human placenta-conditioned medium (HPCM) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results of this study can be summarized as follows: the endogenous production of Td/CIA can be elicited by addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="52290">mitogens</z:chebi> to NBM, and is prevented if the marrow is T-depleted or treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi>; suppression is completely reversible if Td/CIA is removed from NBM by washing at 1, 48, 72 and 96 h; CFU-c which have been exposed to Td/CIA once, and freed from Td/CIA by washing, are still sensitive to a second exposure of Td/CIA; there is no clear competitive inhibition between Td/CIA and HPCM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These experiments represent an in vitro model of a lymphokine-mediated regulation of CFU-c growth not associated with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> of progenitor cells </plain></SENT>
