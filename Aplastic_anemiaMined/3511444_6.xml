<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> donors were HLA-identical family members </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Fifty-seven of the 81 (70%) are still alive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Twenty-three untransfused patients were conditioned with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, 50 mg/kg/d, for four days, and 19 (83%) have survived from 5 to 12 years </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> 58 transfused patients were conditioned with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>, 50 mg/kg/d, for four days, 11 received additional immunosuppression, and 19 received posttransplantation donor buffy coat cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Thirty-eight (65%) have survived from 3 to 13 years (P = .1) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In a multivariate analysis, the only factor significantly associated with increased survival among patients with sustained grafts was the absence of significant graft v host disease (P less than .0001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The factors significantly related to increased rejection were low bone marrow cell dose (P less than .05) and positive relative response in mixed leukocyte culture (P less than .0001), but the addition of buffy coat cells did not significantly influence graft rejection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The development of grades II to IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> graft v host disease was associated with random donor platelet refractoriness (P less than .05) and donor/recipient sex differences (P less than .05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Patients at highest risk for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> graft v host disease were those patients who developed significant <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> graft v host disease (P less than .01) and who received buffy coat infusions (P less than .025) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients who were untransfused had a negative relative response and were not refractory to random donor platelets </plain></SENT>
