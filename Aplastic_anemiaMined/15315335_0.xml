<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The CD34+ cells were isolated from the cord blood with MIDI-MACS Semi-solid <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53448">methylcellulose</z:chebi> culture technique was used to measure the formation of CFU-GM; The expression level of cyclin D3 was assayed by semi-quantitative RT-PCR and Western-blot after the hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells were incubated in AA serum </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the AA serum could inhibit the formation of CFU-GM and down regulate the expression level of the cyclin D3 at the <z:chebi fb="2" ids="33699">mRNA</z:chebi> and protein level respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In conclusion, the AA serum could inhibit the proliferation of hematopoietic stem cells and down regulate level of cyclin D3, which might be one mechanism of hematopoiesis inhibition in AA </plain></SENT>
