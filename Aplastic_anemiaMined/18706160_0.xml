<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: The abnormality of hemopoietic inductive microenvironment (HIM) is involved in the pathophysiology of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are main source of bone marrow stromal cells which constitute the bone marrow HIM </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Thus, the <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> in AA may be related to the function of MSC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to investigate the hematopoiesis support function of MSC in children with AA in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Bone marrow samples were collected from 24 children with AA at diagnosis and 19 children with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001973'>idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura</z:hpo> (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="16039">ITP</z:chebi>), <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021345" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious mononucleosis</z:e> or <z:hpo ids='HP_0002840'>lymphadenitis</z:hpo> (controls) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>MSCs from bone marrow samples were isolated, cultured and expanded </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain><z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>Morphology</z:mp>, proliferation activity and colony forming unit-fibroblast (CFU-F) were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The ability of bone marrow MSC to adhere hemopoietic cells was assayed by <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The concentration of stem cell factor (SCF) released from MSC was tested using ELISA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mononuclear cells (MNC) of bone marrow were plated onto a feeder layer formed by MSC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Cells count and BFU-E, CFU-GM, CFU-GMME productions were measured </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The first and third passage time of MSC in children with AA was longer than that in the controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The number of CFU-F in children with AA (15.70+/-5.78) was less than that in the controls (21.73+/-5.74) (P&lt;0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>The concentration of SCF in MSC supernatants in children with AA (30.69+/-16.82 pg/mL) was significantly lower than the controls (50.74+/-14.83 pg/mL) (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>The total MNC count and the number of BFU-E, CFU-GM and CFU-GMME colonies in the support of MSC in children with AA were significantly lower than those in the controls (P&lt;0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: The hematopoiesis support function of MSC was significantly reduced in children with AA in vitro </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The decreased hematopoiesis support function of MSC may be related its decreased proliferation capacity and SCF release activity </plain></SENT>
