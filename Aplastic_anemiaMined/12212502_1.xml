<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN: Retrospective, descriptive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>METHOD: Of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> patients who underwent an HLA-identical sibling-donor BMT for severe aplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> at the Department of Paediatrics, Leiden University Medical Center, in the period 1971-2000, and had a follow-up period of at least 1 year, the medical data were reviewed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The patients were split into 2 groups: patients transplanted before 1989 (n = 24), and patients who had their BMT from 1989 onwards (n = 20) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This was due to a change in the treatment policy, namely a reduction in the period between diagnosis and BMT, resulting in fewer blood transfusions as well as changes in the prophylaxis against <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GvHD) from 1989 onwards (combination therapy using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> and cyclosporin) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: There was an increase in the 1-year actuarial survival rate from 67% in the period before 1989 to 90% thereafter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The incidence of GvHD has significantly decreased since the introduction, in 1989, of the combination therapy using <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> and cyclosporin, with only 1/20 patients suffering from <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GvHD versus 13/24 prior to 1989 (p = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>No patients acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GvHD after 1989, whereas before 1989, 10 patients had acquired this (p = 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The prognosis of allogeneic HLA-identical sibling transplantation for paediatric patients with severe aplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> has considerably improved over the last 30 years due to improved supportive care, a significant decrease in GvHD and a shorter period between diagnosis and BMT, with the result that less blood transfusions have been required and less sensitisation has occurred </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The long-term survival chance has increased to 90% </plain></SENT>
