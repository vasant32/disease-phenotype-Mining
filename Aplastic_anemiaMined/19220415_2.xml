<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Although there have been many recent studies on the efficacy of antithymoglobulin (ATG) combined with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> A (CsA), there is no data on the correlation between the variability of CsA levels and the response to IST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Therefore, we retrospectively assessed the factors associated with IST efficacy in patients with acquired severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (SAA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Sixty-six patients were treated with ATG combined with CsA for 6 months </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the response group, the CsA levels were increased rapidly to more than 200 ng/mL within the first 2 wk after starting the IST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>However, the non-response group had a pattern of slower increase of the CsA levels </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The CsA levels, during the first and second week of treatment with IST, were significantly different in the responders and non-responders </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The factors predictive of response to IST and survival were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The univariate analysis showed that a younger age at the initiation of IST, a high absolute neutrophil count prior to starting IST, a short interval between the diagnosis and initiation of IST, and high CsA levels during the first and second week of IST treatment were positively associated with the response rate and overall survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The multivariate analysis showed that these four factors were independent factors associated with a longer patient survival </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>A high response rate was associated with a short interval between diagnosis and initiation of IST as well as high CsA levels during the first and second week of IST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Therefore, early intensification of CsA levels might improve patient outcome </plain></SENT>
