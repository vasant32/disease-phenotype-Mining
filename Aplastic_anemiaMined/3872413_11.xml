<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Cells were labeled with murine monoclonal antibodies that are relatively specific for B cells, T cells, T-cell subsets, and monocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The data suggested that the number of lymphocytes and the ratios of various subclasses of T cells were not useful in identifying patients who were likely to recover </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The complete absence of monocytes was found to identify patients who would not recover, but the presence of monocytes was also sometimes associated with lack of recovery </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An unexpected finding was the significant (P less than 0.0001) association between clinical recovery and the presence of a population of small cells (4 to 8 micron) that were phenotypically associated with the erythroid lineage </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>If this association is confirmed, flow microfluorometry may be useful in selecting the optimal treatment for individual patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
