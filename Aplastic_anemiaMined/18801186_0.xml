<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>CASE PRESENTATIONS: Case 1: A 49 year old female with <z:hpo ids='HP_0006775'>multiple myeloma</z:hpo> received an autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant in October 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Eight days following her autograft she developed septic shock caused by Klebsiella oxytoca <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004610" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bacteremia</z:e> which was successfully treated with intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="43968">meropenem</z:chebi> and gentamicin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Case 2: A 29 year old female with sickle cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> and severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> underwent an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant in July 2005 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seven months following her unsuccessful allograft, she developed septic shock due to Klebsiella oxytoca <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004610" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bacteremia</z:e> caused by a <z:hpo ids='HP_0000010'>urinary tract infection</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The septic episode was successfully managed with intravenous <z:chebi fb="0" ids="43968">meropenem</z:chebi> and gentamicin </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Klebsiella oxytoca should be considered as a possible cause of severe <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> in recipients of various forms of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>However, these <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> may be complicated by <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0004610" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">bacteremias</z:e>, septic shocks, systemic dysfunctions and even <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>deaths</z:hpo> if not managed promptly and appropriately </plain></SENT>
