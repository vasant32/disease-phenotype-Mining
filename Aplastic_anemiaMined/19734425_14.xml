<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Fludarabine (Flu)-based conditioning might improve outcome in older patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We analyzed retrospectively 30 patients older than 30 years receiving such reduced-intensity conditioning HSCT according to recommendations of the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) and compared their outcome to a control group receiving the standard regimen (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi>+/-antithymocyte globulin) over the same study period (1998-2007) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Patients conditioned with Flu had a higher probability of overall survival than the control group (p=0.04) when adjusting for recipient's age </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>This might be related to a trend towards a reduced incidence of graft failure in patients receiving Flu (0% vs. 11%, p=0.09), while no difference was observed regarding <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> incidence </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Flu-based conditioning regimen may reduce the negative impact of age in older patients with SAA receiving an HLA-identical sibling HSCT </plain></SENT>
