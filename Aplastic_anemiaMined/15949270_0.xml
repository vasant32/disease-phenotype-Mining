<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To analyse the proportion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> associated <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (HAAA) in severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (SAA) and its clinical features of HAAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> newly diagnosed SAA cases in our department in the recent 5 years were analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A case-control study was undertaken to investigate the differences of clinical and laboratory features between HAAA and non-<z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> associated SAA (non-HASAA) patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The proportion of HAAA in SAA was 3.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in PB cell counts, bone marrow hematopoiesis status and the amount of blood transfusion between HAAA and non-HASAA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Sera from 13 patients with HAAA were tested for antibodies to <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> viruses A, B, and C and <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> B surface antigen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Twelve (92.3%) of them had negative serologic results for the tests and only one (7.7%) had a positive result for HBsAg and HBeAg </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="29995">aspartate</z:chebi> aminotransferase (AST) levels were decreased prior to the diagnosis in twelve (92.3%) of the 13 HAAA patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The percentage of CD4(+) cells in HAAA patients was significantly lower than that in non-HASAA patients (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>HAAA patients had higher percentages of CD8(+) cells (P &lt; 0.05) and lower ratios of CD4(+)/CD8(+) (P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> rate of the HAAA patients was significantly higher than that of non-HASAA patients (84.6% vs 42.3%, P &lt; 0.05), with different mortalities (61.5% vs 15.4%, P &lt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The 2-year survival rate of HAAA patients was significantly lower than that of non-HASAA patients (16.6% vs 83.2%, P &lt; 0.01) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The proportion of HAAA in SAA was 3.3% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Most of HAAA were associated with non-A, non-B and non-C <z:hpo ids='HP_0012115'>hepatitis</z:hpo> virus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Compared with that of non-HASAA, the abnormality of T cell immunity of HAAA was more severe, with a higher frequency of early <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and a higher mortality rate </plain></SENT>
