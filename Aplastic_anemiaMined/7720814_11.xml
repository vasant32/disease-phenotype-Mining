<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>These AA patients may have T lymphocytes whose myelosuppressive effect is mitigated by CyA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We established a total of 29 T cell clones from the bone marrow of a CyA-dependent AA patient in relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Some of the CD4+ T cell clones demonstrated a specific proliferative response to irradiated autologous bone marrow cells enriched for CD34+ cells (CD34(+)-rich cells) obtained from the patient in remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>One of the T cell clones showing the best proliferative response to CD34(+)-rich cells carried the T cell receptor V beta 17 and produced interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) only when cultured with autologous CD34(+)-rich cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>This T cell clone inhibited colony formation by colony-forming unit-granulocyte/macrophage (CFU-GM) and burst-forming unit-erythroid (BFU-E) by approximately 60% when it was cultured with autologous CD34(+)-rich cells in <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53448">methylcellulose</z:chebi> medium, although the clone did not exhibit direct cytotoxicity to the CD34(+)-rich cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The inhibition of in vitro hematopoietic progenitor cell growth by the T cell clone was partially abrogated by the addition of CyA to the culture </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These findings suggest that in some patients with CyA-dependent AA, CD4+ T cells autoreactive to hematopoietic progenitor cells exist and may play an important role in the pathogenesis of <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow failure</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
