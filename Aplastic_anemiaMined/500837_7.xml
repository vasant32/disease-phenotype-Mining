<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> patients showed a gross reduction in colonies and clusters in incidence and absolute number in the bone marrow and blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Two proliferative abnormalities of CFUc in aplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> were identified: a significantly higher than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> cluster to colony ratio (P less than 0.05) and a higher than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> ratio of granulocytes to total aggregates in the bone marrow </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Eleven out of 34 patients tested had serum inhibitory to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> CFUc </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>These patients were indistinguishable from the rest on haematological and CFUc culture characteristics, and no correlation between the results of CFUc assay and haematological severity was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The results suggest that the CFUc is abnormal in aplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo>, the reduction in pool size being related to a failure of self-renewal, but an immunological role in the pathogenesis of aplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> remains unproven </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The close relationship of CFUc incidence to the percentage of granulocyte precursors in the marrow, together with the failure of the CFUc assay to predict clinical severity, limits the practical use of the assay to the confirmation of diagnosis in aplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
