<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the long-term outcome of immunosuppressive therapy (IST) in patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (SAA) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: Hematopoietic recovery (peripheral blood cell counts, bone marrow aspirates, bone marrow biopsy, in vitro culture of hematopoietic progenitors), immunity of T lymphocyte, quality of life and side-effects of the therapy were assessed in 50 SAA patients who have survived more than 3 years after IST </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: At 3 years, 4 years and 5 years follow-up, 81.5% (13 cases), 86.7% (13 cases) and 89.5% (17 cases) of the SAA patients reached and maintained <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> peripheral blood cell counts, 93.4% (15 cases), 93.3% (14 cases) and 94.7% (18 cases) showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow pictures, and 37.5% (6 cases), 40.0% (6 cases) and 73.7% (14 cases) had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> yields of bone marrow cell culture, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Overall, 86.0% (43 cases), 94.0% (47 cases) and 52.0% (26 cases) of the total SAA patients were normalized in peripheral blood counts, bone marrow picture and culture of hematopoietic progenitor yields, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>During the follow-up, 88.0% (44 cases) of the patients achieved 100 of Karnofsky scores; 26 of the 31 patients (83.9%) who received bone marrow biopsy showed <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> histological pictures, and 29 of 37 patients (78.4%) tested had <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subsets of T lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>No clonal disease was found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The late side-effects of IST were mild </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> of the parameters tested were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> in 24 patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: After IST, the hematopoietic function of bone marrow, the immunity of the T lymphocyte and the life quality were normalized with few side-effects in patients with SAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These patients would probably be cured </plain></SENT>
