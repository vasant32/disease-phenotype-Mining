<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The bone marrow and peripheral blood were taken from patients for preparing the smears with Wright staining </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>500 karyocytes in bone marrow and 100 karyocytes in peripheral blood were detected, and the features of morbid cells of erythrocyte, granulocyte and megakaryocytic series were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The results showed that differences between <z:hpo ids='HP_0005505'>refractory anemia</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemias</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001878'>hemolytic anemia</z:hpo> as well as <z:hpo ids='HP_0001889'>megaloblastic anemia</z:hpo> were statistically significant (P &lt; 0.05) in the granules scarce and absence in the intracytoplasm of segmented neutrocyte in peripheral blood, Pelger dyskaryosis, the numbers and detected rate of immature granulocytes, monocyte detected rate, the granules scarce in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> stage of granulocytic series in bone marrow, odd number and prolification of nucleolus in erythrocytic series, little macronucleus and single circle nucleus macronucleus </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>It is concluded that cell <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> is the foundation of diagnosing the <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>, the abnormality <z:mp ids='MP_0000002'>morphology</z:mp> both in peripheral blood and bone marrow play the consequence role in the diagnosis of <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> </plain></SENT>
