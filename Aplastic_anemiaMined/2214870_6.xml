<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>After an initial response, the patient became refractory to GM-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>However, treatment with interleukin (IL)-3 restored responsiveness to GM-CSF, suggesting that IL-3 may have replenished the bone marrow with myelopoietic progenitor cells sensitive to the action of GM-CSF </plain></SENT>
