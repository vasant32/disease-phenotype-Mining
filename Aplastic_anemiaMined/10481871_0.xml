<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>MATERIALS AND METHODS: 15 patients were treated for severe AA in 1995-1997 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>8 patients of group 1 were given ALG/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> with subsequent TABM from HLA-identical sib donor </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>To prevent graft versus host reaction the patients took <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> (CSA) + <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Those who had no sib donor (7 patients) were treated with ALG/CSA (group 2) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: A complete remission at 7-30-month follow-up was observed in 6 patients of group 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>One patient died of infectious complications in rejection of the transplant and one patient died of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> graft versus host reaction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>None of group 2 patients achieved the remission </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>One patient died of infectious complications </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The others need continuous hemotransfusion therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: In spite of high probability of early complications after TABM, TABM-subjected patients are more likely to achieve a complete remission and recurrence-free survival than those given immunosuppressive therapy alone </plain></SENT>
