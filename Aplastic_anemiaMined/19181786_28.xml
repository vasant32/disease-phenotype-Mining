<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>BACKGROUND: We hypothesized that the addition of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">sirolimus</z:chebi> to standard horse antithymocyte globulin (h-ATG) and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> (CsA) would improve response rates in severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, due to its complementary and synergistic properties to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> A </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>DESIGN AND METHODS: To test this hypothesis, we conducted a prospective randomized study comparing hATG/CsA/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">sirolimus</z:chebi> to standard h-ATG/CsA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>A total of 77 patients were treated from June 2003 to November 2005; 35 received h-ATG/CsA/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">sirolimus</z:chebi> and 42 h-ATG/CsA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The two groups were well matched demographically and in blood counts prior to therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The primary end-point was hematologic response rate at 3 months, defined as no longer meeting the criteria for severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The study was powered to show a superior hematologic response rate of h-ATG/CsA/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">sirolimus</z:chebi> compared to standard h-ATG/CsA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The overall response rate at 3 months was 37% for h-ATG/CsA/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">sirolimus</z:chebi> and 50% for h-ATG/CsA and at 6 months 51% for h-ATG/CsA/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">sirolimus</z:chebi> and 62% for h-ATG/CsA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>After a planned interim analysis of 30 evaluable patients in each arm, accrual to the h-ATG/CsA/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">sirolimus</z:chebi> arm was closed, as the conditional power for rejecting the null hypothesis was less than 1% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The rate of relapse, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1516669" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">clonal evolution</z:e>, and survival (secondary outcomes) did not differ significantly between patients treated with the two different regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSIONS: Despite a theoretical rationale for its use, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="9168">sirolimus</z:chebi> did not improve the response rate in patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> when compared to standard h-ATG/CsA </plain></SENT>
