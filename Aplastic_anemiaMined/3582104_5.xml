<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The case reports presented so far, concerning a possible causative relationship between the ophthalmological use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="17698">chloramphenicol</z:chebi> (O-CAP) and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">blood dyscrasias</z:e>, are few in number, not always fully documented and therefore not always convincing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The overall use of this drug in a restricted area in the Netherlands was assessed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>On a yearly basis 1:29 people used O-CAP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>In a four-year period in the same area, 12 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and 190 patients with other cytopenic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0334044" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">dyscrasias</z:e> were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>After exclusion of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases with other possible causes of the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0334044" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">dyscrasia</z:e>, e.g. <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancer</z:e> and related therapy, other drugs than O-CAP and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious diseases</z:e>, 59 cases remained in which a definite cause could not be established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We traced back the use of O-CAP in the relevant period </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>No <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0334044" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">dyscrasias</z:e> were found that unequivocally were caused by O-CAP </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The rate of O-CAP use in the <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0334044" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">dyscrasia</z:e>-group was approximately equal to that in the population as a whole </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Hence we concluded that it is highly improbable that O-CAP played a part in the etiology of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018939" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">blood dyscrasias</z:e> in the region </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Statistical evaluation of material derived from a much larger region may, however, lead to a more differentiated conclusion </plain></SENT>
