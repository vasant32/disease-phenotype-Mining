<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>In the phase 3 trial, 227 DIC patients (full-analysis set) having <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infection</z:e> and/or <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancy</z:e> as the underlying disease received either TM-α (0.06 mg·kg for 30 min once daily) or <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> (8 U·kg·h for 24 h) for 6 days using the double-dummy method </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Among these patients, 147 patients with noninfectious comorbidity leading to severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> (e.g., <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0376545" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">hematologic malignancy</z:e>, or <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>) were excluded from the present analysis, and 80 patients with <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infectious disease</z:e> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi> were extracted and subjected to the present retrospective subanalysis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0005521'>Disseminated intravascular coagulation</z:hpo> resolution rates were determined using the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi> diagnostic criteria for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0010340" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">critically ill</z:e> patients at 7 days, and mortality rates were evaluated at 28 days </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In the TM-α and <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> groups, <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi> resolution rates were 67.5% (27/40) and 55.6% (20/36), and 28-day mortality rates were 21.4% (9/42) and 31.6% (12/38), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Mortality rates of patients who recovered from <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53092">DIC</z:chebi> were 3.7% (1/27) in the TM-α group and 15% (3/20) in the <z:chebi fb="5" ids="28304">heparin</z:chebi> group </plain></SENT>
