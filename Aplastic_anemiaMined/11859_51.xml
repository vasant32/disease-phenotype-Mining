<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Forty-six had marrow engraftment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Of these, 20 are surviving with good peripheral blood counts between 186 and 999 days, and 18 have returned to <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> activities </plain></SENT>

<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Thirty-six patients who had received random donor blood transfusions were randomly assigned to receive either CY or procarbazine-antithymocyte globulin-CY as conditioning regimens to test whether the incidence of graft rejection could be decreased </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>There was no difference in the incidence of graft rejection between the two regimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>In 13 patients with rejection, second transplants were attempted either with the original marrow donor (9 patients) or another HLA-identical sibling (4 patients) </plain></SENT>
