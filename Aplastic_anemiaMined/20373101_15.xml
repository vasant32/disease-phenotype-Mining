<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to compare hematological response and overall survival in patients submitted to horse or rabbit antithymocyte globulin as first-line treatment for severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We retrospectively compared 71 consecutive patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, classified according to the antithymocyte globulin preparation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Analyses included variables related to patients and to immune suppression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Forty two patients (59.1%) received horse and 29 (40.9%) rabbit antithymocyte globulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Response rates were higher at 6 months in patients submitted to horse in comparison to rabbit antithymocyte globulin (59.5% versus 34.5% respectively, p = 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Median time to response was similar between the two groups (99 versus 88.5 days, respectively, for horse and rabbit antithymocyte globulin; p = 0.98) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Overall survival at 2 years was significantly higher in patients submitted to horse in comparison to rabbit antithymocyte globulin (78.4% versus 55.4%, p = 0.03) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Post-treatment response was strongly associated with survival at 2 years (97% in responders versus 41.2% in non-responders, p &lt; 0.001) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Use of rabbit antithymocyte globulin was an independent predictor of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011420'>death</z:hpo> (odds ratio 2.5; 95% confidence interval 1.03-6.04; p = 0.04) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Rabbit antithymocyte globulin was associated with a significant and prolonged <z:hpo ids='HP_0001888'>lymphopenia</z:hpo> in comparison with horse antithymocyte globulin </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Our data suggest the superiority of horse over rabbit antithymocyte globulin as first-line treatment for severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, both regarding hematological response and survival </plain></SENT>
