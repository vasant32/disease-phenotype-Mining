<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> were conditioned with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> (CY), patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> were conditioned with a combination of CY and total body irradiation (TBI) or <z:chebi fb="0" ids="28901">busulfan</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Sixty-three of the patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (54%) and 100 patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> (51%) were categorized as mixed chimeras based on the concurrent presence of donor and host lymphohematopoietic cells 14 days or later after transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>The TBI dose used for conditioning was inversely correlated with the development of mixed chimerism (P &lt; 0.0001) among <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>No other patient- or transplant-related parameter was identified which contributed significantly to the development of mixed chimerism </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The incidence of rejection was higher but not significantly so in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> who were mixed chimeras </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>The incidence of leukemic relapse in patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> who were mixed chimeras was increased only if mixed chimerism occurred after day 100 (P = 0.015) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD (grades II-IV) was lower in mixed chimeras than in complete chimeras, but this difference was statistically significant only for patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> given single-agent GVHD prophylaxis (P = 0.0008) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Mixed chimeras in that group also had a better survival than complete chimeras, while no significant difference was observed in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> given drug combinations for GVHD prophylaxis </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Among patients with <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp>, both overall survival (P = 0.03) and relapse-free survival (P = 0.04) were significantly superior in mixed than in complete chimeras </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Thus, mixed chimerism was frequent among patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and with <z:mp ids='MP_0005481'>CML</z:mp> and was not uniformly associated with graft failure or leukemic relapse </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The interaction between conditioning regimen, GVHD prophylaxis and chimerism are complex </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>The survival advantage of mixed chimeras is only in part related to a lower incidence of GVHD and other factors are likely to contribute </plain></SENT>
