<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>They are also common pollutants in the working places of the plastic industry, chemical industry, and leather industry </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>It has been reported that these pollutants cause people to be irritated, sick, experience a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002315'>headache</z:hpo>, and be dizzy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>They also have the potential to induce <z:hpo ids='HP_0002099'>asthma</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, even cause abortion or fetus malformation in humans </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In this study, the airborne toxicity of <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17578">toluene</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27338">xylene</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16842">formaldehyde</z:chebi> to murine embryonic stem cells (mES cells) were tested using airborne exposure technique to evaluate the mES cell airborne exposure model on embryotoxicity prediction </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Briefly, mES cells were cultured on Transwell inserts and were exposed to an airborne surrounding of test chemicals in a chamber for 1 h at 37 degrees C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Cytotoxicity was determined using the <z:chebi fb="0" ids="53233">MTT</z:chebi> assay after further culture for 18 h at 37 degrees C in <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> medium </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The airborne IC(50) (50% inhibition concentration) of <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="9" ids="17578">toluene</z:chebi>, <z:chebi fb="3" ids="27338">xylene</z:chebi>, and <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16842">formaldehyde</z:chebi> derived from the fitted dose-response curves were 17,400 +/- 1290, 16,000 +/- 250, 4680 +/- 500, and 620 +/- 310 ppm, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain><z:chebi fb="56" ids="16842">Formaldehyde</z:chebi> was found to be the compound most toxic to mES cells compared to <z:chebi fb="56" ids="16716">benzene</z:chebi> homologues </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>The toxicity data had good correlation with the in vivo data </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>The results showed that the mES airborne exposure model may be used to predict embryotoxicity of volatile organic compounds </plain></SENT>
