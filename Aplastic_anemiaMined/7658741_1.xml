<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The long-term follow-up of these patients has allowed to observe an increased incidence of late malignant hematological complications such as <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo>, which raises the question whether they are just different forms of presentation of the same disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report two cases of severe acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> with long-time survival, one of them developed a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> and the other one a <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> followed by an <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We discuss the factors associated with a high risk to develop <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002488'>acute leukemia</z:hpo>, and its repercussions in therapy </plain></SENT>
