<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To evaluate postgrafting prophylaxis for graft-v-host disease (GVHD), they were entered into a prospective randomized trial comparing the effect of a combination of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> (n = 22) to that of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> alone (n = 24) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Forty-four of the forty-six patients had evidence of sustained marrow engraftment </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Only one patient in each of the two study groups showed graft rejection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>A significant reduction in the cumulative incidence of grades II to IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD was seen in patients given <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> (18%) compared with those given <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> alone (53%) (P = .012) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>In three patients given <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> alone, grade III developed, and in six, grade IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD developed, compared with none given <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Eighteen of the 22 patients given <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> and 15 of the 24 given <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> alone are alive between 5.5 and 44.5 months (median, 18 months), with actuarial survival rates at 2 years of 82% and 60%, respectively (P = .062) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The incidence of fatal <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0021311,C0009450" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">infections</z:e> was higher in patients given <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi> alone, whereas there are as yet no significant differences in the incidence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We conclude that <z:chebi fb="0" ids="44185">methotrexate</z:chebi>/<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> treatment resulted in a significant decrease in the incidence and severity of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GVHD in patients who received transplants for severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and thus an improvement in survival </plain></SENT>
