<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Although allogeneic bone marrow transplantation has been shown to be a highly effective treatment for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0005558'>chronic leukemia</z:hpo>, leukemic relapse remains a significant problem </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Leukemic relapse occurs in recipient cells in the majority of cases, but the paucity of donor cell <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemias</z:hpo> may reflect the sensitivity of the investigative technique </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We have developed a highly sensitive technique to identify the origin of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> hematopoietic cells in the post transplant state which is based on PCR amplification of microsatellites, polymorphic tandem repetitive elements </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We have identified donor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> M5) following a sex matched BMT for severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, verified a previously reported case of donor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> following BMT for <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> granulocytic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> and recently identified an acquired cytogenetic abnormality(del 11q23) in donor cells four years following an apparently successful BMT for <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">AML</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cases the donors have remained healthy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Postulated mechanisms include transfer to the transplanted marrow of a dormant oncogene residing in the DNA of either a virus, the chromosomes of degenerating irradiation damaged host leukemic cells or in the marrow stroma which is radioresistant and host in origin following BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Using sensitive techniques donor <z:hpo ids='HP_0001909'>leukemia</z:hpo> has been shown to be a more common event than was previously thought and an understanding of its pathogenesis may allow us to elucidate leukemogenic mechanisms in man </plain></SENT>
