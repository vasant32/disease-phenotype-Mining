<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>However, in patients who do not respond to this treatment and who are not candidates for bone marrow transplantation few successful therapeutic alternatives exist </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>We report two such patients who have shown a therapeutic response to <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">Cyclosporin A</z:chebi> (CSA) (<z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">Sandimmune</z:chebi>, Sandoz) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Case 1, a 15 year old male, and Case 2, a 34 year old female, were diagnosed as having SAA in September 1984 and May 1984 respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Treatment with high dose <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">Methylprednisolone</z:chebi> (MPN) and ATG in Case 1 and MPN, ATG and Oxymetholone in Case 2 for ten days was ineffective in both cases </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Case 1 developed <z:mp ids='MP_0002531'>anaphylaxis</z:mp> with both repeat ATG and ALG (antilymphoblast globulin), and Case 2 failed to respond to repeat ATG </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Both required frequent packed cells and platelet transfusions </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>At five and six months respectively following completion of ATG therapy, CSA was started at 10 mg/kg/day in divided doses orally </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Renal and liver functions and CSA blood levels were followed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Within six weeks both patients exhibited a hematologic response and were no longer transfusion dependent </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>On maintenance therapy of 4 mg/kg/day (Case 1) and four months after discontinuing CSA (Case 2) the hematologic values are as follows: <z:chebi fb="0" ids="35143">hemoglobin</z:chebi> 160 and 130 g/L, absolute granulocyte count 3100 and 1640 X 10(9)/L, and platelets 132 and 84 X 10(9)/L respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>Side effects included <z:hpo ids='HP_0000998'>hypertrichosis</z:hpo>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0000212'>gingival hyperplasia</z:hpo> and mild reversible nephrotoxicity </plain></SENT>
