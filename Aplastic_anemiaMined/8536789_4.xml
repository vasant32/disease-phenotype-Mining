<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>The aim of this study was to measure the level of cytokines produced by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNC) in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) and determine their effect on <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> bone marrow (BM) colony growth </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Thirty-five patients with AA and 21 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls were enrolled in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Medium conditioned by PBMNC of AA patients in the presence of phytohemagglutinin (PHA) was found to be suppressive to the clonal growth of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> BM cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Thus, we further determined the presence in the PBMNC conditioned medium (CM) of inhibitory cytokines (macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha [MIP-1 alpha], transforming growth factor-beta 2 [TGF-beta 2], interferon-gamma [IFN-gamma], and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0027651" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">tumor</z:e> <z:mp ids='MP_0001651'>necrosis</z:mp> factor-alpha [TNF-alpha]) and stimulatory cytokines (granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulatory factor [GM-CSF], interleukin-3 [IL-3], and stem cell factor [SCF]) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The results show no significant difference between AA patients and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls in the spontaneous production of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> cytokines by PBMNC </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>After PHA stimulation, the production of MIP-1 alpha, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, and GM-CSF significantly increased in the cultures of AA patients (p = 0.0009, 0.0002, 0.0022, and 0.0156, respectively) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>However, both TGF-beta 2 and SCF were undetectable in most of the tested samples </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>IL-3 was measured in the conditioned medium only after PHA stimulation, but without significant difference between the two groups (p = 0.67) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, the myelopoietic suppressing effect of AA-PBMNC CM could be significantly blocked by pretreatment with specific antibodies to the corresponding inhibitory cytokines (MIP-1 alpha, IFN-gamma, and TNF-alpha) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>After antibody neutralization, an apparent change occurred in the clonal growth of <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> BM cells incubated with AA-PBMNC CM, resulting in colony enhancement of 205, 131, and 237% by anti-MIP-1 alpha, anti-IFN-gamma, and anti-TNF-alpha, respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>These results suggest that overproduction of inhibitory cytokines, rather than underproduction of stimulating cytokines, may play a role in the progression of at least some patients with AA </plain></SENT>
