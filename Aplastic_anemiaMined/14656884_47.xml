<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>With 13.6 years of follow-up, the 10-year survival estimate was 64% </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Four factors were associated with lower survival: older age, use of Cy-TAI, any form of treatment prior to transplantation (either <z:chebi fb="5" ids="50113">androgens</z:chebi> or immunosuppressive therapy, [IST]), and grade II to IV <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GvHD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>TAI was the sole factor associated with the occurrence of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> GvHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The risk of <z:e sem="disease" ids="C1306459,C0006826" disease_type="Neoplastic Process" abbrv="">cancers</z:e> (15-year cumulative incidence, 10.9%) was associated with older age and with the use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporine</z:chebi> as IST before transplantation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Cumulative incidences and risk factors of nonmalignant late effect including avascular <z:hpo ids='HP_0010885'>osteonecrosis</z:hpo> and late <z:mp ids='MP_0001794'>bacterial</z:mp>, <z:mp ids='MP_0001799'>viral</z:mp>, and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0026946" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">fungal infection</z:e> were also analyzed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Improved results using Cy-ATG as conditioning can lead to more than 90% chance of cure in patients with SAA </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Even if, in our experience, the role of Cy-ATG versus that of Cy-TAI remained inextricably related to the year of transplantation, the major detrimental role of the GvHD disease in the long-term outcome and its relation to TAI supports avoidance of irradiation in the conditioning regimen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Furthermore, avoidance of any IST before transplantation in patients with a sibling donor is a prerequisite for attaining such excellent results </plain></SENT>
