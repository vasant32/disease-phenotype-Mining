<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>The patient was 83 years old male, who had suffered from <z:hpo ids='HP_0001908'>hypoplastic anemia</z:hpo> for more than 5 years before he admitted to our hospital </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>His blood picture was peculiar because adding to <z:hpo ids='HP_0001913'>granulocytopenia</z:hpo>, CD8 (+) large granular lymphocytes were dominant among his lymphocytes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A few days after administration of bolus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="6888">methylprednisolone</z:chebi>, prominent <z:hpo ids='HP_0001923'>reticulocytosis</z:hpo> and rapid improvement of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo> occurred and the latter continued for more than 1 year </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>We performed in vitro study on the mechanism of his cytopenias </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The result of Southern blot analysis showed that his blood lymphocytes had a unique rearranged pattern of T cell receptor beta chain gene </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Mononuclear cells had an inhibitory effect on autologous and allogenic CFU-E colony formation of bone marrow cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These facts suggest that colony proliferating CD8 (+) lymphocytes had an inhibitory effect on erythropoiesis in vivo, and <z:chebi fb="2" ids="8378">prednisolone</z:chebi> blocked this inhibitory pathway in this patient </plain></SENT>
