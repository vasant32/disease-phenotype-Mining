<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Maximal AICML was demonstrated in two cases at the time of bone marrow graft rejection </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Successful transplants after immunosuppression with rabbit anti-thymocyte serum, procarbazine, and <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4027">cyclophosphamide</z:chebi> were performed in two patients, in whom sensitization was detected before transplantation </plain></SENT>
