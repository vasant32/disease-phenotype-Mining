<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Here we report heterozygosity for the 258 + 2 T&gt;C SBDS gene mutation previously identified in <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi> patients in 4 of 91 patients with apparently acquired <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA) but not in 276 ethnically matched controls (Fisher exact test, P &lt; .004) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Affected patients were young and had a poor outcome; they had reduced SBDS expression but no evidence of the pancreatic exocrine failure or <z:hpo ids='HP_0000924'>skeletal abnormalities</z:hpo> typical of <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Length of telomeres in granulocytes of SBDS heterozygous patients was short for their age, and in <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi> patients with both SBDS alleles affected further analyzed, granulocytes' telomeres were even shorter, correlating in length with SBDS expression </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Higher <z:hpo ids='HP_0001425'>heterogeneity</z:hpo> in telomere length also was observed in <z:chebi fb="26" ids="8984">SDS</z:chebi> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Telomerase activity of SBDS-deficient patients' lymphocytes was comparable with controls, and no physical interaction between SBDS protein and telomerase complex components (TERT or TERC) was established </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>We propose that heterozygosity for the 258 + 2 T&gt;C SBDS mutation predisposes to AA by accelerating telomere shortening of leukocytes via a telomerase-independent mechanism </plain></SENT>
