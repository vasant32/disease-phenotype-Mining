<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Several lines of evidence suggest that overexpression of interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) in the marrow microenvironment may play a role in the pathogenesis of marrow suppression in <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>We previously showed that overexpression of IFN-gamma by marrow stromal cells inhibits human long-term culture initiating cell activity assayed in vitro to a much greater degree than the addition of soluble IFN-gamma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The effect of IFN-gamma on true repopulating stem cells assayed in vivo has not been studied previously </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>We compared the effect of co-culture of murine marrow cells in the presence of stromal cells transduced with a retroviral vector expressing murine IFN-gamma vs stromal cells transduced with a control neo vector </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Using a murine congenic competitive repopulation assay, there was significantly less long-term repopulating stem cell activity remaining after culture on mIFN-gamma-expressing stroma as compared to control stroma </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>We also investigated the effect of directly transducing murine bone marrow cells with the mIFN-gamma or control vector </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Marrow cells transduced with either vector were transplanted into W/Wv recipient mice </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The percentage of vector-containing cells in the mIFN-gamma mice was significantly lower than in the control mice, suggesting that mIFN-gamma-transduced primitive cells may not have survived culture, or that mIFN-gamma directly decreases gene transfer into repopulating cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Despite no significant differences in white or red blood cells in the mice transplanted with the mIFN-gamma-transduced cells, the number of bone marrow colony-forming unit-C 16 weeks after transplantation was significantly lower in the IFN-gamma group </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>These data indicate that ectopic or overexpression of mIFN-gamma, especially by marrow microenvironmental elements, may have a marked effect on primitive hematopoiesis as assayed in vivo </plain></SENT>
