<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>A 23-year-old male patient developed <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and was treated with <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> and rhG-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow biopsy showed an improvement in cellularity with a recovery of <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> hematopoietic precursors after nine weeks of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>WBC increased after two weeks of treatment, mostly due to an increase in the absolute granulocyte cell count </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Hb, RBC, Plts and reticulocytes showed an increase six weeks after the beginning of therapy </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Of the serum cytokines, EPO levels progressively decreased, while sTfR increased in peripheral blood </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A reverse correlation between blood neutrophil count and serum levels of G-CSF was observed, indicating an increased clearance of G-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Finally, sIL-2R showed a rapid increase in the first week of treatment and prior to the increase in PMN cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Thus, the use of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> and rhG-CSF in our patient induced a complete recovery of hemopoiesis, and this may be explained by a synergic effect induced by the capacity of <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> to remove inhibitory factors and the stimulatory activity of rhG-CSF </plain></SENT>
