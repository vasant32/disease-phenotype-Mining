<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Changes observed by the examination of bone marrow such as cellularity, histopathologic type, presence of irregular cells maturation in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three blood lineages, condition of medullar stroma can be of great prognostic significance [1, 2, 4, 5] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The aim of the study was to make histopathological analyses in patients with aplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> and to establish parameters significant for the prognosis of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-three patients with aplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> treated in the Institute of Haematology, Clinical Centre of Serbia, from 1988 to 1995 were included in the study </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Bone marrow specimens were analysed for: cellularity, number of megakaryocytes, condition of medullar stroma, presence/absence of blood and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo>, lymphoid elements, presence of plasma and reticular cells, and determination of histopathologic type on the basis of bone marrow changes </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>For data description we used the arithmetic mean and standard deviation for parametric results </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Results of analyses were explained by Kaplan-Mayer's method and two factors analysis of variance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: In <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> analysed marrow biopsy specimens a 100% hypocellularity was observed: 1 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>Weak hypocellularity in two specimens (6%); 2 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Mild hypocellularity in six cases (19%); 3 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>Severe hypocellularity in 24 (75%), In one case (3%) the finding was not known </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>In 25 specimens (75%) megakaryocytes were not found, in 5 (16%) they were rare; in two cases (6%) they were numerous </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>Medullar stroma changes were not found in 30 (94%) byopsies, but in two (6%) they were found </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>Blood and <z:hpo ids='HP_0000969'>oedema</z:hpo> liquid were found in 26 (81%) cases and not in 6 (19%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>Lympho-plasmocytic bone marrow infiltration was found in 23 specimens (72%) and not in nine (28%) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>First histopathologic types two (one-a and one-b) were present in 25 (78%) cases, histopathologic type two in 5 (16%) and type three in 2 (6%) specimens </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>The two factors analysis of variance regarding proportions between dead and alive patients revealed a significant difference in proportions according to histopathologic types (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FD</z:e> = 7.52; DF = 2; p = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>Significant statistical differences were found between alive and dead patients in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> three histopathologic types, tip one (one-a and one-b) (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FD</z:e> = 8; DF = 1; p = 0.06); type two (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FD</z:e> = 4.286; DF = 1; p = 0.041) and type three (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">FD</z:e> = 4.762; DF = 1; p = 0.031) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="18" pm="."><plain>Histopathologic type two had the best prognosis regarding survival probability; p = 0.800; in histopathologic type two survival prognosis was worse p = 0.300, and type three it was the worst, p = 0.000 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="19" pm="."><plain>With regard to survival time, there was no statistical difference in patients with weak and mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow hypocellularity</z:hpo> (p = 0.487) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="20" pm="."><plain>We also compared patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow hypocellularity</z:hpo> with patients with weak and mild hypocellularity </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="21" pm="."><plain>The difference in survival was statistically significant (p = 0.026), Consequently, survival was shorter in patients with severe <z:hpo ids='HP_0005528'>bone marrow hypocellularity</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="22" pm="."><plain>DISCUSSION: Bone marrow biopsy and histopathologic examination are necessary for definitive diagnosis of aplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> [1-3] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="23" pm="."><plain>Cellularity estimation in bone marrow based on biopsy and histopathologic examination is more reliable than that made by bone marrow <z:hpo ids='HP_0002835'>aspiration</z:hpo> [7] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="24" pm="."><plain>Aplastic <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anaemia</z:hpo> is a disease that can be associated with abnormal clones development </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="25" pm="."><plain>Most frequently <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0024790" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="PNH">paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria</z:e>, <z:hpo ids='HP_0011009'>acute</z:hpo> <z:mpath ids='MPATH_336'>leukaemias</z:mpath> and <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndrome</z:hpo> occur </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="26" pm="."><plain>Therefore, repeated bone marrow biopsies are necessary to follow-up the course of the disease [10, 11] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="27" pm="."><plain>The presence of megakaryocytes in bone marrow specimens has favourable prognostic significance </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="28" pm="."><plain>Their appearance is a reliable sign of disease improvement [6, 7] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="29" pm="."><plain>However, <z:hpo ids='HP_0100827'>lymphocytosis</z:hpo>, <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0085663" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">plasmocytosis</z:e> and damaged marrow stroma are markers of bad prognosis [7] </plain></SENT>
