<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>It was characterized by parenchymal infiltration of CD3 lymphocytes, a marked increase in the number of microglia strongly expressing HLA-DR antigens in both the gray and white matter, and diffuse degeneration of the cerebral white matter </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The <z:hpo ids='HP_0003674'>onset</z:hpo> of neurological symptoms coincided with the development of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> systemic <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0018133" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="GVH">graft-versus-host disease</z:e> (GVHD) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Cellular infiltrates in the <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> lesions were exclusively CD3 lymphocytes intermingled with a small number of monocytes labeled with CD68 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>There was a preponderance of cells of the CD45RB phenotype </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The pathological changes in visceral organs were consistent with those of <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>In addition, scrutiny of immunohistochemistry disclosed sparse infiltration of CD3 lymphocytes and diffuse <z:hpo ids='HP_0002171'>gliosis</z:hpo> in the cerebral white matter of another child with <z:hpo ids='HP_0011010'>chronic</z:hpo> GVHD who died 9 months after allogeneic BMT </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>These cases are suggestive of a potential risk of <z:chebi fb="7" ids="29425,29426,29441,29447">CNS</z:chebi> involvement in GVHD </plain></SENT>
