<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>OBJECTIVE: To detect the incidence of the HFE gene C282Y and H63D mutations in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0002863'>myelodysplastic syndromes</z:hpo> (<z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e>) and <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (AA), and analyze the relationship of these mutations with iron metabolism, and organs impairment from <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The incidence of the C282Y and H63D mutations in 271 MDS, 402 AA patients and 1615 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> subjects was measured by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) combining with DNA sequencing </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>Iron metabolism parameters and <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e> indices were retrospectively compared between HFE gene mutation and unmutation groups in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and AA patients with no transfusion history </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: No C282Y and C282Y/H63D compound mutation was detected in <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> the three groups </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The incidence of H63D heterozygous and homozygous genotype did not significantly differ between AA cases and controls (9.7% vs 10.2%, 0.25% vs 0.24% respectively, both P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>The frequency of H63D heterozygous genotype in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients was significantly lower than that in controls (4.1% vs 10.2%, P = 0.002) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>H63D homozygous was not found in <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In both <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and AA patients with no RBC transfusion history, serum ferritin (SF), transferrin saturation value (TS), serum iron concentration (SI) were close to or higher than <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath>; and unsaturated iron-binding capacity (UIBC) value was significantly lower </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in SF, SI, TS values between HFE-mutation and -unmutation <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> patients </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>For AA patients, only the level of SI was significantly higher in HFE-mutant group than in -unmutation group [42.6 (24.6-60.4) micromol/L vs 32.0 (8.4-63.3) micromol/L, P = 0.011] </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in the values of liver enzyme, fasting blood sugar (FBS), <z:hpo ids='HP_0011675'>abnormal electrocardiogram</z:hpo> (ECG), peripheral blood indices between HFE-mutation and -unmutation <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and AA groups (<z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> P &gt; 0.05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: The distribution of C282Y and H63D mutations has ethnic and genetic disparity, the frequency in Chinese population is lower than that in Caucasian </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>It seems that <z:e sem="disease" ids="AmbiguousAbbrv" disease_type="AmbiguousAbbrv" abbrv="ambiguous">MDS</z:e> and AA patients are susceptible to <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e>, in the diseases itself and the mutations of HFE gene are not the major factor for <z:e sem="disease" ids="C0282193" disease_type="Disease or Syndrome" abbrv="">iron overload</z:e> in the patients </plain></SENT>
