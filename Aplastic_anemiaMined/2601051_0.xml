<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>Remission was not achieved by the ALG-oxymethorone therapy, and she was in need of RBC multitransfusion </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>After receiving a total of 42 units (16,800 ml) of red blood cells, it was found that her serum agglutinated strongly her own group BI cells at 4 degrees C </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>This agglutination disappeared in DTT solution </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>An eluate from her red cells also agglutinated BI panel cells, whereas Bi, O I, O i cells failed to react </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>It was apparent that the cold agglutinin in her serum had special affinity for I cells, which also contain B </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Analysis of lymphocyte subset in peripheral blood showed T 3 (CD 3) 70.18%, T 4 (CD 4) 70.92%, T 8 (CD 8) 7.08%, T 4/T 8 = 10.1, T4 (+)2H4(+)/T4(+)2H4(-) = 1.05 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>Although relationship between appearance of anti-BI antibody and relative increment of CD 4 positive cells was not clear, we considered that these findings were caused by an abnormal autoimmune reaction in the patient with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
