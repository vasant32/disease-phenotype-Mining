<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>METHODS: The immune-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> mouse models were built up, and then were divided into 4 groups by randomized allocation </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The models were fed with physical salts (Group A, n = 10 ), fuzheng yangying oral solution (Group B, n = 10), <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> (Group C, n = 10), and fuzheng yangying oral solution plus <z:chebi fb="0" ids="4031">cyclosporin A</z:chebi> (Group D, n =10), respectively </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Another 10 healthy mice served as controls (Group E) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>The changes in blood cells, bone marrow karyocyte count, marrow hematopoietic tissue capacity, and serum interleukin 2 level were observed </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>RESULTS: The blood cells, bone marrow karyocyte count, and marrow hematopoietic tissue capacity in Group A were significantly lower than those of Group E (P &lt; 0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>05) ; those in the 3 treated groups (Group B, C, and D) were significantly higher than those of Group A ( P &lt; 0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>05 ); and Group D was the highest ( P &lt; 0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>05 ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>There were no significant difference between Group B and C ( P &gt; 0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="10" pm="."><plain>05 ) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="11" pm="."><plain>The level of interleukin 2 in Group A was obviously higher than that of Group E (P &lt; 0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="12" pm="."><plain>05 ); The levels of interleukin 2 in the 3 treated group ( Group B, C, and D) were significantly lower than those of Group A ( P &lt; 0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="13" pm="."><plain>05 ); and Group D was the lowest ( P &lt; 0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="14" pm="."><plain>05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="15" pm="."><plain>There was no significant difference in the level of interleukin 2 between Group B and C ( P &lt; 0 </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="16" pm="."><plain>05) </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="17" pm="."><plain>CONCLUSION: Fuzeng yangying oral solution can impove the bone marrow proliferation and reduce the level of serum interleukin 2 in immune-induced <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> mice </plain></SENT>
