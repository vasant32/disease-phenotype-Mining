<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>Various abnormalities of lymphokine production have been described in patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain>To determine if abnormal production of hematopoietic growth factors could contribute to the process of <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> we studied the in vitro production of human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and interleukin-3 (IL-3) by phytohemagglutinin (PHA)- and antithymocyte globulin (ATG)-stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes from 29 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and 15 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>GM-CSF production in response to 1% PHA was seen in nearly <z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>all</z:hpo> samples (43 of 44) and similar amounts of GM-CSF were produced by patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>Production of GM-CSF by ATG-stimulated lymphocytes was seen in 7 of 23 patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> (30%); two of these patients also demonstrated low-level spontaneous production of GM-CSF </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Production of GM-CSF in response to ATG was also seen in 2 of 11 <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls (18%) and barely detectable spontaneous production of GM-CSF was seen in both </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>Biologically active IL-3 could also be detected in PHA- or ATG-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells in several patients and <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> controls </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>Our results indicate that lymphocytes from patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> can be stimulated in vitro to produce <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> quantities of GM-CSF, suggesting that impaired potential for production of T-cell derived hematopoietic growth factors is unlikely to account for the marrow <z:mpath ids='MPATH_133'>hypoplasia</z:mpath> seen </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>In several patients overproduction of GM-CSF was observed, consistent with the notion that some patients with <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo> may have circulating activated T cells </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>We also demonstrate that ATG can stimulate the production of growth factors such as IL-3 and GM-CSF, supporting the role for ATG in stimulating hematopoiesis </plain></SENT>
