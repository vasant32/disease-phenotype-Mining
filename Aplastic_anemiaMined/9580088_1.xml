<document xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:z="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/z" source="Whatizit"><text><SENT sid="0" pm="."><plain>An asymptomatic 26-year-old woman with mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001972'>macrocytic anemia</z:hpo> (11.6 g Hb/dl) was studied </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="1" pm="."><plain><z:hpo ids='HP_0000001'>All</z:hpo> biochemical parameters, bone marrow histology and cytogenetics were <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="2" pm="."><plain>The Ham's and <z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi> tests were negative </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="3" pm="."><plain>A flow cytometric analysis revealed that CD55 and CD59 staining was absent in 20% and 21% of the granulocytes, but erythrocytes and CD34-positive bone marrow cells were CD55 and CD59 positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="4" pm="."><plain>Seven months after the initial study, the patient suffered an episode of <z:hpo ids='HP_0003641'>hemoglobinuria</z:hpo>, with mild <z:hpo ids='HP_0001903'>anemia</z:hpo>, moderate <z:hpo ids='HP_0001873'>thrombocytopenia</z:hpo> and a weak positive <z:chebi fb="27" ids="17992">sucrose</z:chebi> lysis test </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="5" pm="."><plain>A new flow cytometric analysis disclosed an increased percentage of CD55 and CD59 negative granulocytes and a 25% of erythrocytes with an intermediate pattern of fluorescence after CD59 labelling </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="6" pm="."><plain>At fourteen months, a population of CD55-deficient erythrocytes was detected and the Ham's test became positive </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="7" pm="."><plain>The present report is, to our knowledge, the first case of smoldering <z:hpo ids='HP_0004818'>paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</z:hpo> in a patient with no previous <z:hpo ids='HP_0001915'>aplastic anemia</z:hpo>, or evident <z:hpo ids='HP_0001876'>pancytopenia</z:hpo> </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="8" pm="."><plain>The diagnosis was established by flow cytometry of peripheral blood granulocytes, with apparently phenotipically <z:mpath ids='MPATH_458'>normal</z:mpath> progenitor cells in an early stage of the disease </plain></SENT>
<SENT sid="9" pm="."><plain>Flow cytometry appears to be a useful tool in our knowledge of <z:hpo ids='HP_0004818'>paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria</z:hpo> evolution </plain></SENT>
